0	Students should be free to dress as they wish and be comfortable with their appearance.
1	It is not possible to force people to wear school uniforms, I mean, each person has their own way of deciding whether or not to wear school uniforms. I think each headmaster should reconsider his position on this matter.
2	This type of argument is destroying this forum, and it will make arguments less common. I don't think "indisputable" means what you think it means, and I'm not sure what you mean. I'm arguing with you personally, and that's why I'm arguing. I think Yahoo! has chat rooms more suited to your style of debate.
3	I'd never let her go because she's my wife, and she made a mistake, and we can get over it. If she believed me and told me what she did, I couldn't do that.
4	I wouldn't have turned myself in, just because the girl I married killed somebody doesn't make them evil.
5	TV's terrible, except maybe Spongebob, which is a good show, but the majority of TV's terrible, so I'm going to have to choose books based on it.
6	I'm fond of books, I'm fond of getting lost in them, And your literature is also improved, as my English teacher says.
7	You save money when you read a book. I'd like to remind you that you don't need a reading device when you read a book, and you don't need electricity.
8	I'm sure books are superior to television, it's more convenient to place you in a whole North Wales, and it's educational.
9	Books light up the soul, books don't destroy children's morals, books take the reader on a journey to mystical places, paradise, even the kitchen sink, they change the way you think about life and often give you a sense of relativity. Television is a drug, just like nicotine.
10	India's Military Neighbours (China and Pakistan) have a bad relationship with Pakistan because they have territorial disputes and have fought four wars for this. And as for China, its relations have become tense with China due to territorial disputes and India's interference in Pakistan, which Pakistan has long-term plans such as the Pak China Economic Corridor and Gawadar Mega Oil City.
11	stupid India, they're really bad. So, BOO INDIA BOO!
12	India is a good adopter, but a bad developer, and the leader should be a great developer.
13	Russell Peters's a master of making fun of these people.
14	The recent report shows that 50% of scientists at NASA are Indian IITians, imagine how much our status, value and astronomical knowledge of India would have increased if those scientists joined ISRO. Now, think about Indian IITians, students who are preparing for IIT, they are known to be superrain. If India is capable of opening hitech institutions, why are we unable to provide them with a perfect job at their level. We are giving them an international status of education, and we are not able to take advantage of their advantages. This is due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, adequate working environment and adequate salary. So, the need of the hour is to improve our industrial sector.
15	I'd rather be without a father, not saying that not having a father is better than having a lousy father, but I believe that you can grow up without a father and still succeed.
16	Although it's probably the most difficult thing in life, I'd rather be without a father than be frustrated every day.
17	Raffles visited Singapore with Farquhar, so it is possible that Raffles saw Singapore before Farquhar became its founder.
18	Raffles had written his discovery wrongly, that is, on February 29, 1819. He had believed that he had discovered Singapore on his way to India.
19	Without Raffles' ambition and vision, Singapore would have been a sparsely inhabited island on the fringes of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
20	Raffles had established a magistrate in Singapore, who had led to activities such as gambling and slavery being controlled by Farquar, who had protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and had brought traders into Singapore while he was away.
21	It's interesting, because it's your job to prove that we're still evolving. I don't know about you, but I haven't seen a human form change in a thousand years.
22	I've been a nurse, and the more I've studied biology, the more amazed I am at the miracles of our bodies. Every single cell has its own design that's even more complicated than a computer. Do you think that there must be a creator for this highly organised machine, or do you need proof that it was created by some kind of accident or by some kind of divine intervention?
23	Although I've chosen evolution, creation is easier to accept because it's necessary for us to exist in the universe.
24	It's like believing that the puzzle can be solved by pouring the pieces out, because two pieces are stuck together.
25	Firefox and extensions leak memory like a sieve. A startup of Firefox 2.0.0.1, three tabs, a week uses 250 MB of memory in Task Manager on Windows.
26	PE should be compulsory because it keeps us healthy and fit. If you really don't like sports, you can stop doing it when you're an adult, but when you're a kid, it's the best thing you can do. If you prefer to relax and watch TV all day, you're more likely to get sick and unwell.
27	I think that founders should be leaders whose organisations and groups respect them. Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders, but when William Farquhar was sent to Britain, more people sent him there than the combined number of people who sent Raffles overseas in the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that Singaporeans respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and Farquhar was more competent.
28	I'm aware that many children are adopted, but not all, and perhaps it's better if we just abort and let them suffer.
29	Who's to decide what's good and bad? Can't we just let people decide and live with the consequences?
30	We're actually evolving, look at this; our little toes are getting smaller and smaller every generation, and eventually, they'll be gone.
31	What's your point? I understand people have religious beliefs and stuff, and that's fine for them to do what they want without being judged for every move they take, but evolution is scientifically proven to be correct.
32	So why don't we have talking monkeys? It's a red herring. The monkeys haven't evolved to talk, I guess you mean speech, because they aren't capable of speech. But us, on the other hand, have evolved to talk. Yes, if we are derived from monkeys, that doesn't stop them from living. We are branches on the tree of life, not a dead end.
33	Pornography isn't wrong, if it's really wrong, then it should be "illicit".
34	Pornography is not inherently wrong, because it can't hurt anybody who doesn't participate in it by choice. It's really just that simple.
35	Oh, yeah, they're all virgins, or they still live with their mothers and can't have porn.
36	It's not wrong, and if you're talking about the actors doing the scene, it's their choice and it doesn't hurt women who want to do it. We have free speech, you see, and it also helps us to be more open about sex.
37	A rapper once said that he was the people's champ. Sometimes you have to worry about the common good, because that's what people want.
38	I think they're different ways of feeling happy and proud about what you're doing. I'm happy helping others, but that doesn't mean I'm helping everyone in front of me. I'm trying to do what I think is the best and most appropriate thing to make someone happy.
39	I think helping people is a good thing, because it gives me a good feeling that I'm doing something good in my life.
40	It's a good thing, because it shows that the school and everybody else accepts each other no matter where they are, who they are or what their religion is.
41	Wearing school clothes, you'll be sure you'll be in school for studying, and not show off your fashion sense.
42	It is only personality, not physical appearance, that allows equality and fair social status. I admit it is fun and creative to dress however, it is only fun if everyone can do it, and that is not the case for some children, who are not able to meet their peers' standards and cannot afford to stay up to their peers' standards.
43	The school uniform is a very good idea, why?? because it concentrates students more on education than their clothes, and I think it instills discipline among students, which makes students with different material status more equal :)
44	If you don't have a father, it's better than not having one at all.
45	There's scientific evidence that having mother and father is the best way for a child to grow up physically and mentally. So a bad father is better than none. (Assuming that he doesn't abuse his children in any way.) People change. Who says he'll be bad forever.
46	I'd rather hope my father's a good father than know I'll never see him. I'd like to know what kind of father he might have been.
47	The next level thinks he's the next level. Atlas would have dropped the world for a chance to shake hands.
48	As bottled water production increases, extractions from water near bottling plants are intensified, which leads to a shortage of water for nearby consumers and farmers. Moreover, two gallons of purified water are lost during the purification process for every gallon of water used in the manufacture of bottles.
49	Water bottles can easily be turned into long-term fiber materials, such as clothing or carpet, and it's simple to fill the cup with water and use it again.
50	TV's a lot more fun than reading books from the olden days!
51	TV's better than a book dathu ihfej tijkjdrk xtklp09 guil09 sfjiiytg dh,lut457 p[];o;l
52	I'm so fond of TV. I'm able to watch whatever I like, and it's the best thing ever.
53	Most Americans recycle 86-88% of their bottles, that's over half! So don't complain about it being wrong to recycle because we do it! http://www.treehugger.com/culture/23-percent-of-americans-donatmt-recycle.html
54	Without plastic water bottles, there's no sunshine, just darkness.
55	Until we get out of this recession, we can ban drinking bottles!
56	I'm not proposing that homosexual marriage should be treated as a single but identical union, and that it should be called a "civil union." "Furthermore, the consequences of this union must be minimal." "Why should any group demand a change with a small relative impact?" "Why should any assumption be challenged?" I'm not arguing that the law should not change, but that it should be blindly applied to a different situation. See my reply to res0ndf7 for more on this point.
57	There's nothing like "gay marriage", only a man and a woman can be married.
58	I'm an American, and I'm ashamed to admit that "Merica is rich because of slavery, India was poor, but it was rich before the British came and took it all away. We were in a bad state, but we started to improve quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America, and soon all of us will be educated, which is going to happen in our lifetime.
59	India is a secular state, and the people of all communities live here, so it knows almost all the countries and their languages. Hence it is easy to lead the world without creating any chaos among its people.
60	How can Indians say that India doesn't have the potential to lead the world? India is heaven on earth and only India has the potential to lead the world. Believe yourself and hard work.......... India will be the potential to lead the world like no other country.
61	I'm saying no, because spanking doesn't solve the problem, anyone can recover from a spanking quickly and do the same thing again. So it's a good thing to be stricter than to abuse a child.
62	It depends on the severity of the attack. Of course, I'd be sympathetic to my husband and want him free, but if I knew that this was a malicious act rather than self defense or protecting his family or property, I'd probably leave and not have anything to do with it.
63	I'd say I'd be bringing them in, 'cause I don't think that's right killing someone and then letting them go, and also I don't wanna be around a murderer at night.
64	I would have turned them in, even if it hurts me. Anybody who kills should not get away with it, because if they did it once, they could do it again. It's dangerous to keep them around.
65	The government doesn't have a place to tell a woman what she can do with her body, but it does have the right.
66	I'm a pro-life, and I'd like to ask you a question: Does the child in the mother's belly live or not, and if not, how do you know?
67	How can you argue against that in Nebraska?
68	There should be no argument about this, whatever your views are about fetus, it is still a very intimate being created in a very intimate way. You should not change what Mother Nature, God, fate or whatever has decided for you. And if you do not want to have children, you should not have sex or use protection. There are some women who are raped, and it is very unfortunate, but they should give the child up for adoption. It is not the fault of the child that it was created. So why should the guinea pig be responsible for the ultimate cost of its existence?
69	There are many ways to avoid getting pregnant. Condoms, morning after pills, patches, pills, and other ways to avoid getting pregnant. It's the fault of the female that she didn't do it. And maybe, instead of Pro-choice versus Pro-Life, they should have pro-life, but with exceptions (such as those who are raped), so that it's fair in the end.
70	It's a good argument if a woman is raped, but why would you punish an innocent child for a crime committed by another man? If she doesn't want the child, she could give it up for adoption. I don't understand why you would kill a child, and the emotional trauma would have occurred even without the child.
71	Yes, I think homosexual marriage should be allowed. The majority of people who don't want it aren't fond of homosexuality at all, and therefore they tend to be prejudiced.
72	Marriage is not a Bible origin, but it exists in almost every society, including societies that have never been touched by Christianity or Judaism, and societies that have existed before Christianity or Judaism.
73	You cannot choose a lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call a lifestyle a "choice" if you are not that person and know that homosexuality is not a choice.
74	If you don't like gay marriage and think it's wrong, then don't watch a gay couple kiss. Who's to say that their views are wrong and they must change their feelings and that they are obviously wrong?
75	It seems to me that if you want to help others, you must first help yourself. It may seem selfish at first, but once you have reached a point where you are very good at what you do, you can help others to do the same.

77	I'm sure my name is on his list of "offenders" because I don't like the Christian ethos Bush is trying to spread.
78	It's the oldest known history, and the earliest civilizations used to do it in Mesopotamia, which is older than Egypt. I wonder how many Africans would be willing to go back in time and stop importing their ancestors. Africa has all the aid, drought, pestilence, civil war, ethnic genocide, and no economy. America, after all, sounds pretty good.
79	You've got to be fighting for your kids, California's pretty fair about dads. Your kids have a legal right to see you, unless you're declared unsuitable for some reason.
80	I'm not a lawyer, and you should probably talk to a lawyer, but the full legal text says, "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works." The definition of "primarily intended" for commercial purposes is a bit fuzzy, but if you aren't making more money than it costs to run the site, etc., then you are probably acting within the license.
81	That's the beauty of the U.S., you don't have health care, why would you change that you have to go to jail and the rest of the nation is paying taxes?
82	Yes, if you execute a murderer, he will never get away, he will never hurt anybody else, and it will heal the victims' families. The thought that a murderer is still alive hurts the psyche of the victims, and it is fundamentally wrong to execute him.
83	Skating isn't illegal, but it's dangerous to skate in some public places. I used to work at a shop, and kids were skating on the sidewalk, almost killing some old customers.
84	You can't legislate how you feel about another person, but the First Amendment protects them. Don't ask the question, "Why isn't the government doing anything about it?" They love stealing freedoms rather than protecting them, so I'd rather they stay out of it. And, besides, freedom of speech allows us to watch out for the crazies.
85	It's not usually the question that the guys are asking, but the fact that you're not the father, but the mother.
86	Unfortunately, I agree that it's difficult to convince us to send troops into the world, but I applaud it when we do. The problem is that we always get trapped in the maze of international politics and never fully commit to a mission, so we end up failing and look like a half-hearted effort with consequences that we can't handle.
87	No, you have to pay if you're connected to city sewers. Check with your city council. They probably negotiated a delay in payment when they first installed, even though it wasn't a city problem. It's a service that you have to pay for. I was charged extra sewer when I filled up my pool, which was worth 6000 gallons, even though it wasn't a complete waste. If they can charge you, they will. Especially if all your neighbors are connected, they don't have a choice.
88	Despite what most people think, the minimum ages for babysitting or the minimum ages for children to be left alone are not in most states. Unless someone can give you a specific Illinois law, the answers you're getting here are of little value.
89	There's no "right" to not be insulted, in a free society. You read the paper, looked at the Internet, watched TV, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc
90	I don't think it's right to put GPS systems on people's legs so the government can see where they are, cell phones, I almost forgot. Besides that, the government says it's all about safety, but I don't know how safe I feel knowing someone listens to my phone calls.
91	I would say that not all foreigners are unrealistic, but it depends on the country they come from..er, which country.. Like all the world has its good and bad.. I think the bad ones know who they are and why.. If a nation is violent and unhappiness is good for the world and the government, liars and murderers, it is not well liked by the people, because the government is supposed to represent them..so it is the government that causes it and its people pay for it.
92	All right, let's make a law that allows us to issue national driver's licenses, because it will make our country safer against terrorists. A lot of terrorists on September 11th had driver's licenses that they couldn't get under the strict conditions you've laid down in your bill.
93	You're thinking of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader, right? He once said, "You can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea." He was talking about how the idea of freedom from oppression is spreading and will continue to spread, no matter how many attempts to eradicate it.
94	In one sense, you raise an interesting question, but I would like to challenge you to think about it a little more: Do our laws reflect our morality, or do they reflect the morality of the people we serve? In their first book, Our Oriental Heritage, Will and Ariel Durant wrote that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbors needed them. Now think about it a little. In my opinion, faith can and should guide public policy.
95	The court must rule on the conviction being annulled, void, overturned, as if it no longer exists. The records need to be erased, and that requires more legal work. Even if that is granted, there will always be a paper trail, and the fact that someone was arrested at all will always be part of that. It is practically impossible to remove all records, even with a court order.
96	Our current drug policy is doing more harm than good drugs.
97	No, you are not a rascist for wanting your family to have equal rights to the others. In fact, you should have more rights if you were born and raised in the country, but unfortunately, that is not the case here in Britain. We actually have less rights and receive less benefits if we become unemployed or sick, as opposed to the migrant workers who make much more money than we did.
98	It's not discriminatory to say you committed a crime, it's a choice. It's not like everyone turns you down. I usually look at the crime when I hire, and believe me, there are a lot more people with records than you think. If someone is a thief or a violent person, I won't hire them. Companies can refuse to hire for any reason. It's just that there aren't enough openings here in Michigan for that.
99	The point is that you have the right to your opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts, not just for the crime you committed.
100	Why do people ask questions when they don't know what they're talking about, Sandytoes? Asking a clerk of court isn't going to help, and they don't have the right of giving legal advice. Why don't you tell us more details on the judgment, what was it for, when was it made, why did it expire? What state do you live in? In California, for instance, judgments expire after 10 years.
101	I'm guessing you've got a case, but did you take pictures of all these "repairs"? Sometimes the threat of a small claims court gets them to sign a cheque, and sometimes you need a lawyer to draw up the papers. You did agree to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be of a similar quality as the original ones.
102	You need to protect yourself and your family, no matter whether the police are there to protect you. If a person breaks into your house at night, you might not have time to call the cops, and even if they are only five minutes away, you could be killed a hundred times in five minutes.
103	I think prostitution is overrated, if a woman wants to have sex with many men and gets nothing, but if she is given a few dollars, she is a prostitute, why? Why do they give her those things for free?
104	We should shut down our borders, we're at war, we can't afford to look after these people, we're not even taking care of our own. They don't have a reason to teach us English, they can learn English before they go to the test. If I go into another country, I don't expect that they'll be able to talk English before I go to the test.
105	There are many types of mental, physical, neglect. Maybe he just doesn't want you around anymore, maybe he's retaliating for something you did, and he just can't get over it.
106	First of all, cops don't piss you off. You choose to. If you don't want to be pissed off, you won't. It's called a victim mentality. You own your emotions, no one else.
107	Yes, when it is not misused, what is commonly called racial profiling makes sense, if it is not misused. For instance, a carload of black or Hispanic children are driving around a mostly white neighborhood at 3 am, plates are fired, and it is pretty clear that they do not live in the area and may be up to no good. I will say the same about a carload of suburban white boys driving around the neighborhood, in high drug areas, etc., that, contrary to popular belief, is also profiling. Crime needs to be controlled and I do not personally see it as a violation of one's right to be stopped when it is deemed to be suspicious.
108	You are mistaken, they have not been shut down in India, the ban is only in Maharastra. The government had shut down because they received many complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not looking after their families. Also, many criminal activities took place in these bars. You must be aware of the Tarannum or Telgi case where Tarannum monthly income was arouned 1 lac and Telgi would throw away nereby 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To stop such type of criminal activities, the Government of Maharastra had put a ban on these ladies bars.
109	Firstly, the ancient rituals of war that every nation lived by, including the Lakota, which removed the nation that had been here before them, the winner of the war gained the land. Despite some swindles, our ancestors had won the battles with their hands, and the Indian Wars were more of a battle for the land, and the nations lost it because of that.
110	Another thing to think about, while some judges are able to be bought, they are not the real problem. The idea of being a judge is to be impartial and fair, to listen to the merits of each case separately and as it is presented. But some judges, especially a few new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, and they do not feel the need to represent it in court.
111	In my opinion, men often have *less* than no rights in cases of potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to be born, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to be a mother, it is not justifiable to take away that decision from the father.**
112	I've spent my whole life with religious people, always telling me abortion was wrong, murder and immoral. But I've slowly come to realize that it's not really a fully formed human, why would it be murder? It's just someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Don't shame them into having a child based on their religious views.
113	I'm not sure how the adversarial system of judicial procedure helps in finding out the truth. It seems to me that the way in which both parties draw conclusions and attempt to manipulate the jury by using emotional language makes it hard to believe them. Moreover, the jury, who are basically untrained in terms of weighing the evidence, decides which argument is more persuasive, seems to me to be a bad method of finding out the truth.
114	I'm not talking about human extinction, but I think we'll probably survive whatever happens.
115	*The term greek means the social component of my university, which organizes open parties every weekend, with a theme or dress code.* A lot of people may say that it's fine to have fun and laugh, but I think that organizing parties with a dress code that allows people to wear stereotypes of race is a sign of segregation, discrimination, and undermining our international cultures. By allowing these parties to continue as a college community, we are facilitating segregation, discrimination, and undermining our international cultures, which are portrayed as a joke for those who attend. In the end, we are protecting our international and ethnic students, while doing very little harm to the greek side.
116	I understand that the Wilhelm scream is a joke, but it seems to me that it is being used without any thought about the effect it has on the movie.
117	For instance, prostitution stings and drug dealing stings. Anything that does not have a victim and is not physically harmful or with bad intentions. If a police officer witnesses a drug deal or a prostitution deal, that's one thing. But I think that's not the whole picture. Bringing in criminals for these crimes, it seems to me that the police are shopping for criminals to be taken in and baiting and robbing them. Often, these people would have gone about their daily lives without committing a crime.
118	The title is self-explanatory. Vladimir Putin is the head of a disgraced ex-empire, willing to regain his former glory. The Russian people are traditionally loyal, willing to obey the will of an autocratic government, and ready to devote themselves to general patriotic ideals (i.e. acquiring new territories). He seems determined not to comply with Western moral and political values, but to the present overwhelming majority of views against his latest actions. It is clear that Russia's position in international politics is not democratically generated, but exclusively owed to his will. He likes war, confrontation, and seems indifferent to the human costs of his actions. He is determined to make history by any means, just like the celebrity killers do their crimes to make unforgettable, no matter how.
119	The race car is the superior vehicle, except on the moon where the dirt bike is so good at collecting coins with flips and crazy air time, but on maps like the beach and cave, the down force keeps you down and keeps you on the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, you can't miss it, it's made for those levels.
120	First of all, we're very greedy. We like to spend money on things we can't afford, so we can get away with it. And if it was so useless, or even if Congress felt it could get away with it, it would immediately remove it. And it would raise its salaries. But it doesn't. Why? Because they think it serves some purpose, and I assume it's the protection of the USA. Second, it's evolving. You've seen new security measures every year, and while it's annoying, it could potentially save your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in a queue for 30min? I can see that many people on Reddit disagree with this, but I want to know why, so I can make a balanced opinion.
121	I'm just thinking that the first love is the strongest, and every subsequent love is a bit weaker, just like the chase of the dragon after the first drug use.
122	I'm not sure it was really an accident, but it seems to me that dying young is the norm. It seems to me that people who die young, like JFK, Tupac, John Lennon, Andrew Brietbart, have no cause for concern. But I don't see a reason that people keep deifying the prematurely dead. It just feels wrong and makes their legacy seem a little weaker.
123	While I understand that people make mistakes, I believe some actions should have permanent consequences and that we have morally compromised ourselves by making exceptions for them. I fundamentally disagree that every individual has a right to live. If you are willing to put someone else's right to life in jeopardy, then you have demonstrated that you are a net negative impact on society, and that as a whole, we would all be better off if you were dead.
124	I'm not talking about my parents, they're wonderful people. I mean grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (No brothers or sisters, just one child.) The thing is, I don't care if they would do anything for me. It's like having a stranger say they would do anything for you. It doesn't mean I like them or need to care about them.
125	So, if you're out shopping with friends and one forgets his ID but they don't buy, the requirement that he show his ID is useless and inconvenient.
126	I think John Hammond had a good idea, but he was not properly advised by his HR department, so he severely underpaid his most important employees.
127	Video games should be treated like drugs. Millions of lives are affected because people don't watch them carefully or don't use them in moderation. Especially children who are consumed and obsessed with them. It's a shame. I want to change it, but also grateful that now I can make sure that this won't happen again.
128	It's useless, I don't see any good in it. It's not the most efficient way of communicating with people, seeing that we have phones, e-mail, instant messenger, video calls, video chats, apps. They don't have meaning, and they're not very interesting. I don't know why anyone would want to write about their feelings or what they're doing and let everyone know. I don't care if Billy Bob goes shopping, but it's a place for online stalkers, maybe real life stalkers, and maybe future stalkers.
129	If Iraq taught us anything, it'd be that brutal dictators have a place on earth. If this government had any brains at all, they'd have Delta Squads hunkered under the gallows with a step stool, ready to take Saddam back to his rightful place in the capital.
130	As powerful as Superman is, he's vulnerable to Psionic powers, Professor X or Phoenix or Apocalypse would be able to control him, capture him, destroy him. Batman doesn't have any powers, just gadgets, Magneto would be able to do a quick job of him, and the Flash, well, he'd run, and he'd be able to do a quick job of him, too.
131	Yes, it will recover, provided the government stops interfering and bailing out. It was precisely this that turned the possibly temporary market collapse into a huge and horrendous Great Depression, and some Union laws were part of the measures that were then imposed. I wish lawmakers had to learn at least some relevant history when they were in high school.
132	We've surpassed the need for natural selection, and we must control our evolution so that we can survive. We have been able to control our evolution since 1999, and it's time we started manipulating it.
133	If no gun is legally issued with a guarantee that it can trace any bullet fired by a legal gun, if it is found intact, then it poses a threat because there is no way of knowing where the bullet came from and where it came from. It's as if you give someone a Jaguar and promise that they will never let it leave their premises.
134	I'm not sure where you're from, but here in Southern California we have pizza delivery services till 3AM. And I'd rather go to Del Taco than Taco Smell or Taco Hell. In the 1960s, when Taco Fell was part of another multinational corporation, they were great. In high school, we used to go there for lunch because tacos were $5.
135	I see that there are no arguments, so I'd like to clarify a few points. Even though principals do obtain the right to search (for drug tests, even making the student take off his socks if the dog smells something on the student), they only retain that right in the event of a reported drug or crime, or in the event of a sniffer dog check. There are limitations - a principal cannot just demand to search a student's possessions on whim - outlined in the Criminal Code, YCJA and Canadian Charter of Rights (as well as parallel US laws). Thus, the right protects the entire student body safe and away from harmful substances.
136	First of all, bribing a child is wrong. If you teach them to obey you, their parents and teachers, it should be easy. Sometimes they don't like it, but they still do it.
137	I've discussed this with my brother several times, and I think the word "sublime" doesn't exactly describe the band to which it refers. First, there are different definitions for the word, "elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc.", and it certainly doesn't describe the band. Second, "impressing the mind with a sense of grandeur or power; inspiring awe, veneration, etc." But what about "supreme or outstanding?" Well, there's a lot of opinions on that, but I think the general consensus is that the word "sublime" doesn't describe the band. I don't have a problem with their choice of name, and I like some of their songs, but it's certainly ironic that "sublime" isn't sublime.
138	Sure, if it interests the young person, it's an art and takes time to master, so starting early would be a good idea. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll become drunk later in life, but it's still up to their discipline. There are many young drunks who have never been bartenders, but I think they should include a better understanding of alcohol and its effects in the bartending course.
139	So, what's the difference between the Pontiac Pilate account and the Jewish leaders' testimony? Well, the Pontiac Pilate account is that he was a nomad, and that's all that matters. He was no different from any other nomadic man or tribe, and the majority wore long hair, togas or other robes, and sandals were the only footwear available. And you can't say that Jesus was a hippie, much less the first hippie. And the whole controversy is about whether or not Jesus was a Nazarene, and that's what you're supposed to be arguing about.
140	The dog is raised by a child who has left the house to go to college, and when he returns home after six months, his reaction is frantic, lasting a long time, and he is accompanied by whining and affection. This behavior is not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two, and in fact, the dog does not show much enthusiasm.
141	I'm sure the parents who want to have children must pass a series of background and IQ tests, so that children can start a successful life in this world.
142	The reason marriage should be preserved is that it is the best and most natural way of raising a happy and healthy child, and the continuation of the family unit, a man and a woman and a woman who will not grow more branches than the tree, so it should not be called marriage.
143	The currency supply cannot be sustained indefinably, and if it is allowed to continue, the likely outcome will be hyperinflation and another depression. If you allow the government to issue money that is not backed by anything, you are allowing them to steal from the public without anyone knowing about it. Finally, every nation in history that switched to fiat currency has eventually collapsed, because the government was unable to resist the urge to hyperinflate the currency supply and destroy all money. People who do not know history are condemned to repeat it.
144	I'm sure that someone will jump at the opportunity to call this an "almost another one pushing others down", but I felt it was necessary to say it.
145	The iPhone is, of course, the Blackberry of the senior businessmen market.
146	I'm a British music lover, but I think America has brought us more music than we have ever enjoyed. The foundations of modern popular music are Blues and Jazz, which originated in the United States, and without Blues and Jazz, there would not be the Beatles, Rolling Stones or any other major British band before 1977. But don't forget Hip-hop and Punk, two original American art forms that have had a major influence on the UK music scene since the late seventies and early eighties.
147	Obama = good judgment, steady in crisis, curious minds, cares about all people, not just the wealthy, wants to build a green economy, PRESIDENTIAL. McCain = our oldest dated thinker, not curious minds, too entangled in the system he claims to change, stole all the good positions he had in this election, ran a vile campaign, and approved the message, not PRESIDENTIAL.
148	It was a "learning experience" for our country, and I think that having the prohibition law then, we could have seen that it didn't work, and we could have made better decisions in future.
149	Garry: No, I don't wanna.
150	I'm guessing if you're a fan of big burgers, but I don't think it's worth it. My girlfriend recommends it. The fries are good, fresh, but I wouldn't be there for them. They have peanuts in sacks that you can put in little paper bowls and eat while you wait, so it's cute. The place looks like a 1950s diner, so if you're a fan of big juicy burgers, then I'd say yes.
151	I came in at 6:53 p.m. and the clerk behind the counter said that the juice machine was sanitized the night before it closed at 9. I was very disappointed and the clerk behind the counter said that Pulp had not closed until 9 that night.
152	I've been here before, but now that Yama sushi's popularity and size is growing, the sushi has 2x more rice than before and fewer fish, and the service has also deteriorated to an unacceptable level. Besides, they received a B- rating for 16 violations, most of which were violations of the proper temperature of the fish. Go somewhere else, or make sure you get good service.
153	I went in to try the veal sandwich and the baked goods. The veal was not tender enough and it was difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions and it was fine, but the onion was too big. The tomato sauce was liquid and it made the sandwich soggy rather than tasty.
154	We were lucky to have only 20 minutes to wait, and they gave us the wrong oysters, so we didn't get them until the main dishes were ready. Then we tried to eat them, and the oysters weren't even cleaned properly, and the muscle still stuck to the shell. I would have to come back, but only if there wasn't a line.
155	My colleague ordered chicken chow mein and my colleague ordered beef chow fun. Our delivery took an hour and my colleague watched the delivery driver pour our Thai tea and spilled it all over the place. And he didn't have change. What a delivery driver with no change! And the food was not very good.
156	We went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary and they served him a steak that was rancid. It was a terrible experience, but we decided to become vegans. It was a terrible experience for two people who loved seafood and steak, but at least we're better off without it.
157	I'm really against wearing uniforms, because it doesn't help students express their individuality, it's very uncomfortable and in winter it can be very cold.
158	All I'm saying is, Firefox's a lot better than that.
159	All right, you're using Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab when you visit microsot.com.
160	Honestly, firefox's better than the rest of them. Tabbed interface, lack of activeX, support for RSS, what's not to like? The Internet, sadly, is still trying to catch up with it.
161	Firefox is much better, it remembers passwords with more gusto, add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way, I love tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, Weatherfox, gestures, there's even a tab that allows you to view pages in IE format if something isn't compatible (rare, only SAP at work), and the way you can place the logos of the links in the toolbar is awesome.
162	From a design point of view, Firefox is clearly the winner of the Pretty Browser battle. There are so many beautiful skins available for Firefox, and when you add in the number of Toolbars and UX customizations that it supports, the 'Fox' is clearly the winner. And since I suppose most people who debate the superiority of one browser to another are Intraweb junkies, I know that everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to see an ugly interface like the one of every IE (7, the most infamous among them)?
163	I'm fond of Firefox and have defended it, but what's strange is that this site is breaking it.
164	I'm not sure, 'cause it depends on who she murdered and what happened. If it was self defense, I wouldn't have told the cops, but if she was crazy and murdered somebody, I would.
165	I'd turn him in for murdering somebody, don't get me wrong. I'd try to convince him to confess first, but if that didn't work, I'd be forced to bear responsibility. And I wouldn't want to feel guilty about not turning him in.
166	No, I would not, because I would swear to stand by them, in sickness and in health. They might be sick, but she'd be my wife. And if I were to be, I'd try to prevent her from being captured.
167	No, I wouldn't have been able to turn them in, if you really loved someone, especially if it was an accident. But maybe it would have been a little different if he killed someone just because he wanted to kill somebody, because I wouldn't have wanted him to kill me as well.
168	Books improve your grammar and spelling skills, and they're more creative than TV. With books, you can imagine the characters' looks and the setting with your own creativity, and you can take books anywhere and everywhere without disrupting anyone.
169	I do not want India to lead the world in the near future, with the cream layer quota system. Yes, India has the potential, but corruption, this quota system, not helping anyone, and the main reason for brain drain, does not help India in this respect.
170	It's better to be without a father than to be without a father. It's a fact that when you're a girl, you're looking for someone who's like your father. And if you have no father, you don't have to worry about how terrible they are. You just think about how wonderful your father might have been.
171	I'd rather have no father than a bad one who does absolutely nothing. Most kids look up to their fathers, but if they're not good fathers, why are they around? It just means that they'll want to be bad like their fathers.
172	Raffles had been Farquhar's boss and should have been the founder of Singapore, for he had been the head of the State and had more rights than Farquhar. In addition, Farquhar had not performed his duties responsibly and had slaves, fights, and murders all over Singapore. Singapore had been so badly developed that Raffles was unhappy.
173	Pornography is a kind of addiction for some people, which can lead to guilt and lust, and it creates an unhealthy image of real sex.
174	Is it Christian, or not? If not, then who's to stop you? For the record, it's wrong. Unfortunately, it's not possible to argue that if you and the other person don't share the same beliefs.
175	Why do you suppose the gods must operate within the limitations of time when you accuse him of wasting time?
176	Until FF's preinstalled on computers, IE's going to be dominant.
177	If Firefox is the best, why do all the sites that use IE try to be compatible with it?
178	I've been using IE since the beginning, but I've recently switched to Firefox. I don't see any other significant advantages to using Firefox except the tabs feature which was not available in IE. Also, now that IE7 has tabs and add-ons, it's better than Firefox.
179	To install such websites, you need Internet Explorer.
180	I'm using FireFox, but it's not all websites that work well with FireFox, so I'm going to use IE until it's mainstream.
181	Yes, because it's a fun activity on the school day, we have fun and, at the same time, exercise, we lose some weight we've been gaining, not all of it, but obesity is a problem in America, so it would be helpful.
182	Schools should have PE because the school I'm at has PE only for middle school, not high school. We're a middle and high school combined. Many students aren't fit enough to do simple preseason conditioning and they said, "If we had PE conditions, it would've been easier and it would've been simpler." They did only manage three push-ups in their first year of sports.
183	Excuse me, but I find it interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER have not replied to my explanation of why I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion. Funny how people just ignore what they cannot or do not want to argue against. If you want to write a reply to someone's argument on here, click on "view all" first, which will give you a history of their arguments, and it may help to avoid the need for that person to REPEAT himself by addressing something that he has already addressed.
184	I support abortion, if nothing else, because it's the last bastion of free people resisting the government.
185	Nobody's ever mentioned that over 99% of all abortions are caused by unwanted pregnancies, and if you prevent them, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both parties happy?
186	I'm sure we should be more concerned with protecting the rights of animals that are far more intelligent, such as fully developed primates, if we are concerned with the feelings of unborn children in the first trimesters of pregnancy. If we are not, I suppose I am confused about the pro-life position.
187	Women and women alone should decide whether they want abortion or not at any stage of their pregnancy. Why are abortion laws being drafted mostly by older white men? Why are abortionists opposed to capital punishment? Jon Jax 71
188	I'm sorry, creationists, you should click the "Convinced Me" link correctly if the argument of the person convinces you that creationism is correct. But you seem to click on everything and everything on the right side. It's not helping you win the debate, by the way.
189	Evolution is a science, and all the objections I've seen, which I'll defend against, have nothing to do with science. They're theological arguments.
190	I'm not sure you're right about 99% of what you say, and you're against evolution and creationism. At least you say that science doesn't have all the answers, and no scientist would try to counter you on that, and that there might be a good compromise between faith and science where evolution and creationism could be compatible.
191	Not really, but it's as if God and Creationism and God were the same thing as a magician who could make a puzzle out of a magic wand.
192	Whoever said pornography degraded women was a fool. First, they got well compensated, second, they chose to do it, and third, some girls really liked what they were doing. Without sex and porn, you wouldn't have been born.
193	I'm not sure anyone cares about women, as if there's nothing more or less than pornography.
194	Pornography isn't wrong, unless you do it without your partner's back. It's just a humiliation for the women who make the choice to act.
195	I think that advancing common good is more important than personal interest, because most people tend to look out for themselves rather than for others. Looking out for yourself first, rather than looking out for others, isn't going to do much good in the long run.
196	It's a big, bad thing, because the uniforms are also cost effective.
197	I think that school uniforms are a good idea, I agree that many pupils do not like them, but they do have many advantages. As the others have said, children at first do not have to think about what to wear, because it is a big problem for teenagers.
198	Children have two role models; mother and father. The relationship between them affects their behaviour and personality, so if the relationship is damaged, so will the character of the child. I would rather not be a father, because the damage to a bad father would be far greater than the loss of a good father.
199	It's better to have a father who's bad, because I think my father isn't that bad, and I think I'm doing fine. It's just better to know you have a father.
200	I'd rather have a bad father than be fatherless, because I'd be at least calmer if I knew who my father was and wouldn't have to worry about him all my life.
201	To a thirsty man, a drop of water is worth more than a gold nugget.
202	Yes, it's creating serious environmental problems, and maybe people won't want plastic after all if they realize that it hurts us as humans.
203	The big water producers steal our lakes' waters, and in the process, they destroy the habitats of the animals that love water, like platypus.
204	It's just lyrics to the songs that the other side posts, it doesn't have anything to do with water!
205	He's not giving high fives, he's only giving sixes. He's the Godfather. He taught a German shepherd how to bark in Spanish.
206	I'm convinced books are superior, I'm convinced I'm able to fly, that's right.
207	I'm thinking TV's a good thing, 'cause it's faster, some people can't read.
208	Jesus loves plastic water bottles, and you cannot dispute that logic.
209	If homosexuality was natural, then there might only be six people on earth, meaning none of the people who created these sarcastic remakes would be around, and I wouldn't be around.
210	After 2012, India will grow faster than any country in the world.
211	India speaks English better than the original Englishman. The British and Americans speak with many grammatical errors, so who's better, the Indians. "truth is stranger than fiction.".
212	We must not forget Lord Rama, Krishna, Vishvamitr, etc., who give a clear idea that India will become a Vishvguru in future.
213	Yes, India is in line with China for becoming the world's biggest economy with a rapidly increasing population and an increasing economy.
214	Neither. Agnostic is the real answer. People either believe in God or they don't, but they can't know for sure.
215	Atheism; before I believe in magic, I need at least some proof.
216	I'm an atheist because I believe that all of us have a single life that should be enjoyed and preserved for all generations.
217	Christianity is perhaps the most vile ideal for poisoning the mind of man. Its uses, motives, and fictional stories are quite plainly immoral. (http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/religion.html) (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/whynotchristian.html) (http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/ 3956.Christopher_Hitchens)
218	Is there any way of saying that Christianity condones slavery?
219	Sometimes a spanking can be useful in teaching a child, but not to such an extent that it can hurt you and should not be used repeatedly.
220	I think some parents should spank their children only when necessary, because sometimes children learn the right way and listen to their parents.
221	Spanking is not an option for disciplining a child; parents have many other options before spanking. It is better to discuss what they have done wrong and solve the problem properly.
222	It's not right to spank children, it's wrong to do that to our own children.
223	Yes, I'll bring him in for murder, and it's a sin. Maybe if he's arrested, he'll feel guilty about what he did, and he'll try not to repeat it. And also, how can I believe a murderer? He might lie to me, and maybe he'll kill me for some other reason in the future. And that's not how clean and innocent he is when he tells me.
224	For all those who talk about rape, I would like to ask you one question: if you had a big fight and ended up breaking your hand or arm, would you cut it off just so you could remember that you were dying? If you were actually sane, you would say no, and if you said yes, you would see a doctor.
225	When the people condemned consensual cannibalism in Africa, did they consider the right to their bodies? No, why should abortion be any different?
226	What I don't understand is how people rationalize killing, it doesn't make any sense.
227	Everyone has the right to be unhappy, so let gays experience the pleasures of a divorce, the division of assets, child care, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards.
228	Why can't homosexuals, if they're allowed to marry and do whatever they want, when they're allowed to do the same?
229	One of the reasons is that now there are so many more people who agree with us.
230	You must first understand what your common good is, and you must know when you are that better person who can pass on your good to others. You cannot just presume that you are a great person if you have nothing to prove. If you want to see a world full of goodness, you must be the spark that lights the fire.
231	I'm thinking your personal interest should be the first thing you should be doing before anything else. But then again, I'm not sure, because if you need something from your family, you'll do anything to help that family member.
232	I've got a personal goal to achieve, and I want to achieve it before I can start helping others. Although I'm happy to help others, it's me who needs to be helped first.
233	I think that people should be allowed to die with dignity, even though there are obvious needs for safeguards and procedures to protect innocent people from predators. If someone is terminally ill and no longer considers his quality of life sufficient to continue, he should be allowed to request medication to end his life. I have seen relatives die of cancer; no one deserves to be forced to go through this without their will.
234	It's all a bunch of propaganda and mudslinging, but it would be a good thing to elect our candidates who had real facts on how they voted on all the issues that mattered to us.
235	It's still a new phenomenon, and laws and policies are being created all the time. But if you don't feel comfortable with it, ask someone to put a link to their website on your blog. It's a good idea from an ethical point of view.
236	I don't think that sexual harassment occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach or inappropriate personal contact feels insulted, humiliated or threatened.
237	I completely agree, nowadays, thanks to DNA, it's easier to prove guilt, so when it's proven that someone is 100% guilty, I'll hang them. In particular, pedophiles, they're the lowest of the low. As for the Indian answer, it might have been proven that it didn't prevent any more killing, but at least it wasn't a burden for the taxpayer to support such scum in prison.
238	Personally, I don't like it, but since my husband and I run an electrical company that operates round the clock, I think it's a necessary evil. We get a lot of calls on our cell phones at night because our landline is broadcast to our cell phones when we're not in the office, but we always turn them off when we're in a public place so nobody disturbs us.
239	I'm not sure why they don't, after all, because Europeans are allowed to drink at the age of 16 and Mexicans have been drinking since 18 and now it's 21.
240	I don't think there should be more rehabilitation centers, but better ones. In jail they will never be productive members of society, in most rehabilitations they will not either, and the ones that are good are too expensive for your common drugs to pay for, so they quit and end up in jail.
241	The Supreme Court has decided that race is not a primary factor determining admission, but it can be used as part of the decision making process. Diversity is a new way of life for many people.
242	Yes, you can get a ticket for blocking your way in Los Angeles County. It's against the law to block any road, whether it's your own or not. If you block a road with an emergency vehicle, how will the pedestrians get their car out of the park if you leave and they don't leave the car keys, etc., etc. It's also against the law to block a sidewalk.
243	I don't think it's a good thing to say, because it's still a word that divides races. If two African American kids are playing with one white kid and they call each other the n-word, the white kid will always feel like an outsider if he can't greet them in a friendly way. But I do agree, it's a good thing for African Americans to have one thing that they can't use.
244	I've learned that the government should not be involved in marriage, let the churches arrange marriages for whomever they choose, and let the government simply record marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to all. As for plural "marriages," they exist, but there isn't much support for them.
245	I'm surprised that people who support abortion are also against capital punishment.
246	I don't think that everyone has the right to have children.
247	You know, you've been towed three times and impounded for 30 days, haven't you? If you're in California, you're probably not getting the message, are you? You know, because the legislature figured out that you had to be forced to stop driving because you had been taken away from the road and yet you continued to drive. People like you are involved in an exponentially higher number of accidents than the average, so the legislature figured that maybe you should have your cars confiscated by the state if you hadn't obeyed the game plan.
248	I agree that it would be good to reduce abortion in the United States and that birth control should be used by all who have sex.
249	It's nothing different than owning a piece of land, most or all islands are either the responsibility of a nearby country or are called protectorates of a country, so even if you own that "island block", you can't do what you like. There's a chance you could have local laws like those of a town, but remember who will enforce them.
250	If your society regularly punishes or punishes a particular group of people because of their race, then there's no difference. This kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighbourhood) will cause an increase in crime, simply because there's not enough and not enough other options, if any. If white Anglo-Saxon protestants were systematically slaughtered over generations, they'd be pretty much like criminals.
251	You're the one who has to blame yourself for the wrong advice you've received from the Internet chat sites and questions and answers. You don't hire a lawyer for legal advice on Yahoo Answers. You consult a lawyer in your state for legal advice if you need it.
252	For those who misunderstood the question, Jr. is not in jail. He was "charged" an adult rate, not charged a crime.
253	I agree, but the government should be able to save and make a lot of money.
254	You'll have to face a whole war with the woman, and she'll hate you for having revealed her wrongdoing. If you send the General Manager proof of her actions, he may not believe them.
255	I visited Dar a few weeks ago, and I've been wondering whether I can answer your questions in detail, but I think it's worth asking you a question about the general feeling of separation between people. There's not much enthusiasm for anything they do, and they tend to just follow what they are told. There's a lot of tired, laid back working methods, and it takes forever to get there.
256	The sheep are in favor of him because he has succeeded in terrorizing his supporters with fear, using the crayola chart to show people what a terrorist threat is, yet he wants people to live their lives and not allow the events of September 11th to affect our lives.
257	It's not going to happen, people have free will to decide what they want to do. It's not wrong, it's just right.
258	This situation doesn't have anything to do with lease, it's your business to give someone access to your apartment, especially for the reason you mentioned. There's no extra person staying in the apartment, it's not a sublet, you're doing nothing wrong. It sounds like your landlord is very nosey, but you're right.
259	It's the most ridiculous gun law ever passed, you're right, it's not a crime that has been committed, but so far, only one person in the U.S. has been killed with a 50 caliber rifle, and I believe it was a 50A Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammunition that isn't available at every gun store makes it unpractical for criminals. Barrett ended the warrants on LAPD M99s, and then he introduced the California legal.416 rifle, and then he started complaining about the fact that they didn't have any legal restrictions on black powder, so they made an exception for.50 caliber black powder rifles, which is easier for criminals to obtain.
260	It's a shame you can't believe the people who are supposed to protect you. But if you think about it, everyone is racist, some don't even notice. It's a shame we have to live in a box.
261	If you would like to ask forgiveness directly from GOD through Jesus Christ, then you should be a Christian, not a Catholic. Catholics worship saints and idols, like Virgin Mary, and so forth, while Christians worship only GOD through Jesus Christ.
262	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the world's wealthiest nations, which makes them attractive targets for terrorist attacks. Furthermore, they are more likely to be attacked for maintaining this position, and terrorists are more likely to attempt to frighten citizens in those countries. Hence, the United States and the United Kingdom are more aggressive than most other nations when it comes to monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
263	I don't like the idea of burning the flag, but the freedom it represents should allow someone to do it if they want to. After all, the object of destruction is only a piece of cloth. Creating a law that forbids us from burning the flag does more harm than the act itself. You lose so much more by taking away people's freedom.
264	If that happens, the United States will pull out all our funding and all the troops that are under its control. Without US support, there's no UN, so they can try. I'd like to get rid of that organization, which has done nothing but steal, insult the United States and Israel, and waste our money.
265	The First Amendment protects the freedom of the individual to associate with whomever he chooses.
266	I don't think the big supermarkets will want to pay more for coffee beans, etc., when they don't have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their products, and when we are all brainwashed by the money making "carbon footprint" idea, I don't think we'll be able to fly food around the world just to help the poor.
267	(pause here for a deeply bitter laugh)... What an excellent question! Let's see, this is a poor woman, an immigrant, not a middle class white, a woman whose family isn't being torn apart over an agonizing decision about which they don't agree. This isn't an election year, the Shrub is in enough hot water with the public without having this situation get the same attention as Schiavo's case did.
268	Scholars and spies may have compelling interests in the subject, but most of us do not.
269	Almost all the problems we've seen today and throughout history are caused by the fact that we allow them to buy into government with their personal desires and selfishness. If we don't allow them to have the possibility of wealth, we can stop a lot of corruption.
270	I've been told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, but I haven't been told that they are. I think they were going to blow up the IRA because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to expand its territory into Northern Ireland, and that was a blantant lie.
271	I don't know how to implement it, but maybe just decrease the incumbent's vote count by 15% or so. I think something like this *must* be done, not that it's likely under the circumstances.
272	I'm going to start by saying that I am a man, and I'm a man who thinks that he is an egalitarian, humanitarian, socialist. I don't like the feminist movement, because I've seen that they're just a bunch of female supremacists, but I've seen that the MRAs are the same. I agree that there are some gender inequalities that hurt the male gender, but it seems to me that there aren't enough issues to be completely angry activists about it.
273	I think that the test that would be implemented would be quite simple, but would ensure that voters had read the bill before they voted. I think that this could be done by testing that would give samples of people who had not yet read the bill a certain amount of time to read the bill and then answer a number of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could select questions that people with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.
274	You're familiar with the cars with "systems", the bass booming from miles away, the vibration shaking the floor, the music being terrible techno or hip-hop. The DMV should carry out a decibel check on all the audio systems, and they shouldn't exceed the maximum wattage of the horn.
275	I'm aware that religion can be beneficial, because it teaches good morals, encourages people to help others, etc., but I'm also aware that there are a lot of conflicts that have arisen because of religion, like the Second World War, the Ottoman Wars in Europe, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, etc. Another reason I think this is due to the way other religions try to demonize each other. "Your religion is wrong and bad while mine is right and good!" They always demand money,censorship of speech, art, literature, film, poetry, songs, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.,
276	I don't think the climate in the world is stable and unchanging, I just don't think it's as dramatic as the media says.
277	I was reading the post today about the supposed malaria vaccine and it occurred to me that while it is wonderful that this discovery will end suffering for those who are infected and eliminate the possibility of putting more people infected, it will ultimately lead to an increase in the world population. All new discoveries about prevention or life extension contribute to the steady and inevitable increase in population, but I do not see a bright future ahead of us.
278	I've played and beaten it, and I'm not sure why people are so fond of it. The gameplay is pretty much the same as the rest of them, except for the story, which is 90% of what people talk about when they talk about the greatness of the game. And that's true, but what makes it superior to other games is the fact that it has a great story.
279	Assume that mustard gas is used only in the battlefield and not in other areas, such as civilian ones.
280	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary because of the need to preserve Jewish heritage around the world. Why should Israel be established in a historically significant but highly hazardous location because of a historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a part of Germany, relocate a population that actively sought to destroy Jews, and work towards the acceptance of Jewish visitors to their Holy Land? I am aware that not all Germans participated in the Nazis' actions, but annexing a part of Germany is more morally justified than basically conquering Palestine on religious grounds.
281	Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing: 1. Putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships.
282	It's a lottery, luck of the draw, but it's not always the winner. And shootouts are exciting, as any sport can, but they're not the most exciting way to decide a game, especially at World Cup level.
283	I've seen how it's become a cultural reference point for generations following mine, but I haven't touched cards or games in my life.
284	I'm aware that people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, but I find them as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the Holocaust, other genocides, and human rights violations. And yes, I expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from Pyongyang.
285	I understand that transgendered people want to be heard in society, but using the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way of doing it.
286	I've attended or seen photographs of family members' graduations in kindergarten, 6th, 8th grade, my daughter's high school graduation, and I don't mean a simple gathering, I mean full of pomp and circumstance, commencement speeches, hours, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.
287	The Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men on Mount Sinai, and since it was the number that left Egypt in the Bible, it is quite possible that there were over a million people present. It would be a HORRIBLE task to convince a million people that they had been to Mount Sinai and that God had spoken to them, and that is why Judaism is the most believable religion. Islam and Christianity, on the other hand, rely on the same proof and another leap of faith, and therefore they are clearly less believable.
288	I've been thinking about a case where a person is drinking at a party and another person notices him or her and asks him or her to have sex, and if the first person agrees, then he or she waives his or her right to accuse the other person of rape.
289	I'm not sure what to think about Coors Light, Labatts, Budweiser, and so on. But Yuengling is mass produced and pretty good.
290	As far as financial comfort is concerned, there is no marginal utility.
291	If the creator is the "real" being, and the creation is an imitation of himself, then is it possible to love and compassion for the creations that he created? If not, how can the Creator love me or you?
292	I think it depends on how the rich make their money. Some rich people found their money honestly, and should be left alone. But many rich people found significant portions of their money through dishonest means: hiring workers who work for $1-2 an hour instead of hiring legal workers who would be required to pay minimum wage (Wal-Mart has been found guilty of this several times over the last years, especially in hiring janitorial staff), cheating on their tax returns, stealing other accounting fiascos (see Enron), etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.
293	Before I began, I wanted to give you three basic ideas about God: A. He's perfect. B. He's seen all evil. C. He's capable of doing anything he wants. Now, based on these, we can come up with the following: 1. God sees evil in the world, but despite having the power to stop it, C. He's not.
294	Rowing is more intensive, because the legs are usually the strongest limbs in the human body, and it can be very difficult to keep the upper body and core healthy while rowing for a long period of time or for a long period of time.
295	I'm sure that environmentalists are good people, but lately I think they could be classified as a cult. I'm sure they have some good views and help the planet, but I don't like the idea of "global warming" because it seems to me that the earth is warming naturally because of the sun rather than our carbon dioxide production. But these environmentalists are literally trying to create a kind of dictatorship where many aspects of life are strictly controlled so that climate change is stopped. They're trying to control billions of dollars and slow down America's economy. They've gone from being focused on real environmental problems to feeding the public lies and creating new, pretextive problems to waste our time.
296	Bill O'Reilly has an opinion, and sometimes it's justified, sometimes it's not.
297	I agree that academic qualifications are a prerequisite for success in life, because they provide basic knowledge of mathematics, science and languages.
298	The US has already gotten out of worse before, like the late 1970s and the early 1980s, and the Great Depression, just to name a few.
299	After World War II, the car, oil, rubber and construction companies, instead of maintaining, increasing public transport and, as scientists suggested, distributing solar energy, sought the big bucks to destroy public transport, build highways and highways, malls and rely on fossil fuels while destroying the environment. This is just a chicken coming home to roost,
300	It might not be all teenagers, but perhaps the first few months after passing the test should restrict the number of passengers. I would also suggest a restriction on the distance that a newly licensed driver can drive alone or with them as sole drivers, which would be very difficult for the police, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year on the first motorway ride.
301	Monarchies are burdens for economies if they are parliamentary monarchies, because they do not have the original role of ruling. Among them are the British, Danish, Japanese, who have no real power and no political influence and live off the backs of taxpayers.
302	You're supposed to know them inside out, and you're supposed to be soulmates for a few minutes, hours, and days, but you're constantly finding out new things about people that would shock you, proof of crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc., and you're never really going to know what makes a person tick.
303	"Nothing exists," to say, or think about it, applies existence to something that is "nothing." But to say that nothing exists implies, paradoxically, that there is no such thing.
304	I don't think the Phelps clan is protected by the First Amendment here, and I think they've gone too far by focusing on one person's funeral, and that's almost an emotional attack on the Snyder family.
305	In 2002 Ann wrote an article that she tried to be funny, but it turned out to be the most cruel thing she'd ever said.
306	Let us see, if the government wanted him dead, he would have offed him way before when he was actually inventing things that might have been related to weapons. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley, those would have been much more likely to be a conspiracy theorist.
307	I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. I was unsure about going here, but the chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to try it.
308	I'd like to relax, the terrace is nice, the food is good, but I'm not really comfortable with using my card with unknown machines. They should have at least debit or Apple Pay, and that's all. I'd like to come back for a coffee break.
309	The Cheesecake Factory is a big box food joint, but it's hard to argue that it doesn't have the best food. And it's hard to argue that it doesn't have the most inventive or creative dishes. But it does manage to accommodate the huge amount of shoppers who come to the mall hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates.
310	The first time I came here, I ordered a latte and the yogurt parfait. I watched the lady scrape her butt through her yoga pants, and luckily, she washed her hands before she started, but I was already done. I didn't want to eat anything but politely waited......and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....and waited.. 
311	The place was nice, the food was good, but the service was terrible. I had the gnocchi pesto and it was not very good. I didn't like the basil, I didn't like the olive oil, I didn't like the Parmesan. I don't know how that could be. The pine nuts were just sprinkling on top, which was a waste of time. The salad was brown, the house Italian food tasted like stale parm, and the portions were not very good. I'll be back in the summer to try the "most romantic patio in Cleveland," hoping that the next dish will be better.
312	Our waiter was great, very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal. I'm sorry. I'm not sure how bad the food is here, but there are better places in Vegas.
313	I'm not sure if it's always the best place, but it's a good place to go when you want Matzoh Ball soup.
314	I'm thinking we shouldn't be wearing school clothes because they're so strange, and the good thing is that there aren't any bullies anymore and they're dumb, stupid, gay.
315	All that's good about IE is that Windows has it preinstalled, and I hear they'll get rid of that, too.
316	All the innovations of E 7.0 were made in Firefox.
317	I would not have turned them in if my husband had murdered, because I know he had a legitimate reason. All of us make mistakes, and this is the wrong decision he'd made. I love him, and I believe that in love we should stand by your side through thick and thin.
318	No, I would not turn myself in, because when you marry, you make a promise to be there for one another, and I would do everything I could to help her, but, if she was caught, I would not turn myself in, because I would have a family to look after and I would not leave them for nothing.
319	I'd rather not turn myself in, for there's a kind of love that bonds us. But on the flip side, if it's just a murder, I'd turn myself in.
320	I don't think TV is bad, but I think it's a bad thing in large amounts and books are very good for people.
321	As we know, India is full of corruption, every man has no time for helping others, he only wants to make money. Our manners and civilization are diminishing every day.
322	As long as no one understands what they're saying with their fuckin' accent, India will never be the world leader.
323	I don't think India will increase GDP in the next five years because of unemployment. They don't even have enough money to feed all the poor. How can we imagine that they could lead the world?
324	It's really bad when you don't have a man to look up to when you grow up. It's better if you don't have a bad father.
325	It's better if I don't have a bad father, rather than having a bad father.
326	I'd rather be without a father, than a bad father. I'd rather have a mother who cares, loves, and does something with her life every day so that she can pay for food.
327	He had restored the cultural heritage of the region, by building schools for the Chinese and Malays, and had done much for the people, while Farquhar had only sought to gain control through his actions.
328	It's wrong, pornography is wrong because you're lusting, it's even worse if you're married, because you look at someone who isn't your wife or husband, and that counts as cheating. But we've all been lustful before, right?
329	The debate is based on convincing evidence. The evidence for creation is very small, while the evidence for evolution is massive. True. But evolution cannot be ruled out by any evidence.
330	I've been wondering what your best argument is, "Because they don't"? I've been thinking about it for a long time, and I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and behaved the same for thousands of years. How does an animal acquire a trait that he wasn't born with, and does he just wish for it to grow magically? And you proved me right, "species have certain characteristics and properties" I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics change randomly. And, by the way, I wonder what insects you're talking about, because I'm a curious person.
331	IE has been around since then and is already installed on a typical computer. IE is universal, so you need to download or install it.
332	I think that PE classes should be compulsory in schools, because they offer children some exercise. If they were compulsory in every school in the world, there would be much fewer obese children. And, of course, some health classes should be compulsory so that children learn how to eat properly and not become obese.
333	Yes, yes, yes, and definitely yes.
334	While Raffles was gone, Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and brought merchants into Singapore.
335	He invited immigrants from Malacca to trade and set up an office on St. John's Island to inform traders who were passing by about the arrival in Singapore.
336	Raffles didn't care about the people, didn't think about them at all. So what if he discovered Majulah Singaporepura, and he didn't make a single contribution to Singapore's development, why should he be regarded as Singapore's founder? Farquhar had built the island, and he had all his ideas behind it.
337	People were more interested in sending Farquhar away than Raffles when Farquhar left Singapore.
338	Farquar had already eliminated many problems, such as the rats and centipedes, and it had only been a matter of a couple of days that Farquar had slain the whole thing. Raffles had done nothing.
339	"What if the child was a future DaVinci?" is a common question, but there is a simple answer: "What if the woman who is pregnant is a legendary figure in the world, but never gets to see her because she has to care for a child she was not prepared for.
340	Life has existed for billions of years, and any failure to reproduce it in the laboratory is simply due to the fact that scientists have not spent the same billions of years attempting to do so.
341	You know, if you could, please explain your facts to us. You know, the first humans had brain scans, what about the average organ sizes, hair patterns, face and heart rate records? And what about the fact that there was a Garden of Eden in Asia and Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and a Garden of Eden in Africa, and 
342	I'm not sure why it matters so much, we're here. Whoop-de-doo. So go on and live your life. If you believe in creationism, that's great, good for you. If you believe in evolutionism, that's the same. I understand that the point of debate is to convince the opponent of your side and everything, but I don't understand why we have to debate it at all. But I'm sorry, I was a bit hypocritical in posting this.
343	I must say, though the data is not complete, evolution has indeed taken place in the peppered moths.
344	I had believed in God before evolution, but this seems to me that the argument "who created the creator" is applicable here. A God who knows everything, is powerful and merciful, and human, and therefore cannot explain complex life.
345	It's interesting, too, that there are now seven votes for "Porn's wrong", but no one wants (or can) explain why.
346	Everyone has sex, so making money off it isn't wrong, it's genius.
347	Listening to pornography isn't wrong, because in schools, parents never give precise demonstrations because of their children. Pornography teaches not only about education, but also about basic examples.
348	It would be wonderful if I could do both, but since I must choose, I would rather help others in any way I could. Even a little thing can affect a person's life, like being a friend or helping them to find the things that they need to survive life.
349	It's a good idea to wear school clothes, first of all, it makes students look nice and tidy, secondly, we can see who's studying at which school or who's studying at the same school as us, and thirdly, it's convenient, since we don't have to spend too much time choosing the right clothes for school.
350	I'd rather have a bad father than not have a single one, because a bad father is the most wonderful thing that could have happened to you. And if you need someone, you can count on a bad father. And I think bad fathers do that because they love their children and want their son or daughter to be the best he can.
351	It's better to have a bad father than to be without a father, maybe it's not so bad, except that you live with the idea that you don't have a father or that you're doubtful about whether or not you'll ever have one.
352	If you don't have a father, you don't really know what's good and bad. If you don't have a father, you have no one to talk to or count on.
353	I'm sure I've got a bad father, and sometimes he makes me mad, but sometimes he's the most stupid thing that makes me laugh. I don't have a good father, but I still love him, no matter how bad he is.
354	It seems to me that if someone is not good at something, he always has the possibility of becoming great at it. If he is not good at anything, he has no chance of becoming a great man.
355	Bottled water is a big business, but it's a dry well in terms of sustainability.
356	TV because it's the only way to get live news from books you can't find. And it's educational.
357	You can get Foxtel Go for your iPad to watch TV wherever and whenever you want.
358	When you're not bothered by anything else, you can just sit on the couch with a biscuit, burger or candy and watch TV.
359	Water bottles are a safe source of water and guarantee safety
360	In developing countries where public water is the least safe to drink, bottled water is more likely to be found.
361	It's true that bottles are a waste, but they can be recycled!
362	If there wasn't bottled water, people would be drinking sweet liquids because it'd be the only thing that could be carried. People would get fat!
363	It doesn't seem like it's right to have two people living together, but it's clear that God doesn't approve of this.
364	For those who are interested in following these arguments and rebuttals, I think that Chasbas' argument I rebutted on Feb.07, 2007 07:09 has been deleted. I would like the system of rebuttals on this site to be better.
365	Guys and girls were created for a reason, not to be paired with the same sex, but to be paired with the opposite gender. Opposites Attract, everywhere, whether it's magnets, electricity, atoms, or humans.
366	I don't support it, as I said, if there weren't tax breaks or incentives for marriage in the eyes of the state, who cares.
367	It's just unnatural, since all sexual creatures reproduce with the opposite gender.
368	It has the potential, but right now the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent it. I cannot imagine a country that had a great internal conflict, it just doesn't work.
369	India and China could redefine what a third world country means, since they will both become first and third world countries simultaneously in the future.
370	We cannot know exactly whether there is a higher force or not, but Christianity is not. Firstly, because it is not a single belief that everyone shares, it is not uniform.
371	I'm having a big problem with Christianity, why is it about belief? There's been terrible people who believe, but what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists? Is it right to punish them for not knowing what reality is? I am an atheist and I'm a good person. The idea that a mere difference in belief can seal a person's fate is ridiculous, crazy!
372	This debate is about a false distinction, where the only choices are Christianity or atheism. Shouldn't it be "theism or atheism or another"?
373	It's just that kids sometimes have to behave like that, no, stop, don't do it, just doesn't work.
374	I agree, they must understand what they have done wrong, and the consequences will come, and they learn not to do it again.
375	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on soul. An atheist always seeks the absence of God, but a religious person simply believes.
376	Parents should not use spanking as a means of disciplining, it only makes the child angry rather than showing what they have done wrong.
377	No, because it can mentally scare them for life, and it can make them believe that hitting their children is okay.
378	I'd be willing to admit it was self-defense or rage, and if it was self-defense, I'd be able to get away with it, but if it was rage, I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life with him. My conscience would be gnawing, and I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life with him.
379	I'd be willing to turn my wife in if she told me she murdered, whether it was accidental or intentional. If it was accidental, then the police would find out.
380	I've put my argument aside and said, "yes," but it's really up to my opinion. If my husband killed someone for self-defense, I'd rather he kill him than my husband die, but if he killed someone for no reason, I'd probably turn him in. Because love can be strong, but it can also be blind. I wouldn't want to be married to a murderer, because I don't wanna be in a relationship with one who kills me.
381	It's illegal to kill yourself If a person is caught trying to cut themselves in half, they could be sent into a psychiatric hospital. So the government limits what women can and can't do with their bodies.
382	The woman is in charge of her body, she believes she has the right to have a child and then to get rid of him because she feels like it and has made a mistake.
383	If a woman decides to abort her child, she has just killed a life that might have made a significant contribution to society.
384	While phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools, they shouldn't be compulsory (especially not all four years of high school). Perhaps they should be an optional class, and one year is enough for them to be compulsory rather than a continuous course. In the lower grades, though, they should be compulsory because little children are more prone to gaining and losing weight in strange patterns.
385	It's expensive, embarrassing, and unfair to students who don't participate in varsity sports, because varsity athletes can waive the class.
386	How can anyone say that gay marriage is wrong, because it's a personal choice based on one's beliefs, so who's to say that gay couples don't have the right to enjoy all the benefits that heterosexual couples enjoy?
387	I am an agnostic, so my religion is not in conflict with this issue. I am an avid supporter of gay rights.
388	You can feel pride in helping others for the common good, but you must first have a personal interest. I don't think one is superior to the other, but you must have a personal interest before you can help others. But, in the case of some people, their personal interest may be a contribution to the common good.
389	You have a rather limited view of humanity and the obligation to create a decent society, and you seem to be relying on parts of our founding documents that do not exist.
390	They seem to be a bit intrusive when it comes to your Medicaid eligibility. CASA, Community Alternative Systems Agency, is staffed by Registered Nurses who are responsible for determining whether or not you qualify for Medicade if you take your child to a doctor or an Emergency Room and they see something that indicates signs of abuse (bruises, etc..). If that's not the case, they may be trying to determine whether or not you qualify for Medicade. As a result, they tend to get into everyone's business.
391	It is official policy that they make an "orderly market", and therefore they must buy and sell in order to prevent sudden and dramatic changes in the market. Hence they must buy and sell under certain conditions.
392	Yes, the two of them have their own problems, and that's perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife's going to court about her husband, and your new wife's going to court about her husband. It doesn't have to be a conflict.
393	The fact that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent was a major threat to our country's security, and that was all that mattered.
394	I agree that women should have the right to choose, and there are many children in care of who have to go through foster care and have very difficult lives. I am pro-choice. I think that if it is made illegal, there will be a lot of women dying from abortions in places that are not sanitary or in very bad conditions. I would never have done it, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
395	Ethically, it's not okay to spy on innocent people, it's foolish and possibly dangerous to follow celebrities, and many lawsuits have been filed against photographers and newspapers. But we have the right to know what the government is doing, because it's using our money. Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their stealing against us. The 4th Amendment is effectively nixed by SSNs, gun records, more search and seizure, phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that companies are forced to cooperate with bureaucrats and give up any privacy we have left.
396	I don't know the details about Yahoo's involvement, but I'm sure China's government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. The number of incidents has decreased in recent years, but beatings and torture are still commonplace there. America, however, chooses to ignore it because we care more about maintaining good business ties with China than about the fact that many of the low wage jobs we outsource are actually slave labor.
397	If you're strong enough to relive the worst moments in your life again, then you should file a claim for compensation. Money won't change the awful things that these evil bastards have done to you. But if you can get something out of the crap that you've been through, other than anger and bitterness, then you should.
398	I've spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal education, and I don't usually do work for free unless there's a compelling social cause. And no, "I don't want to pay" isn't a good reason.
399	I'm not trying to make this a bash-Bush answer, but I've noticed that he doesn't know how to speak well. You would think he has the finest speech writers, but I don't think he uses them. I almost think he just flies the whole thing, but I don't know. I don't see a problem with speech writers, if you're a president of a company or nation, what you say will affect many people. Hiring someone who is skilled in speeches and public policy is not only rational, but almost the only choice to properly transmit the message you want everyone to hear. Debates are a good place to start, since even though they have official "answers" to the questions, they have to be more alert than when they give an address.
400	First of all, the Constitution does not guarantee the "pursuit" or "pursuit" of happiness. In fact, I doubt the amount of time and energy spent on enforcement of laws on prostitution in relation to other crimes. And, secondly, will you accept the role of morality in criminal law? For instance, laws on the age of consent, why is consensual sex illegal for 15 years but not for 16?
401	It's more like dolphins and porpoises than lions and bats. The reason one is legal and the other isn't is because the law says it is.
402	The justice system established and practiced in the United States is the finest system of human development ever, and it's not perfect, but it's human. It's still the best we've ever made, and it's going to be better, not worse, because people are doing and want better and better, and we'll be better for ourselves and our children.
403	You might be able to. Here's what I would do. 1. Gather all your receipts. If you don't have the actual receipts, you're going to be sucked and you should stop here. But, there's a chance the old pharmacy has your prescriptions in their files and may be able to give you a print out of your purchases. 2. I don't think the pharmacy would be willing to reimburse you, but the insurance company might. 3. Send all the receipts, write a letter and fill out the insurance company's claim form. 4. Send it all in and pray for good luck!
404	You're not supposed to expect any real answers from anybody here, because nobody here knows all the details about your case, and a lawyer would spend a lot of time preparing a defense for you, and nobody here would be able to help you with real help without knowing the details. This is one of those situations where Y!A isn't going to be very helpful to you.
405	You know what they say, "If you can't do the time, then don't do the crime."
406	Yes, if it's his baby, and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound. The father has every right to demand that the child be named after his father, and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if there was anything else in it.
407	Wait, you've signed a contract knowing you won't keep it? And... the answer is YES. The lease allows them to restrict the use of the premises, depending on the exact wording of the lease.
408	Unfortunately, you cannot reopen this case without new evidence, and you can't even try to get your lawyer to do it, but it probably won't help much. A very valuable lesson has been learned here: you were so young when this happened, your body was going through a lot of changes, and with Firestone's records, you should have included a clause in the settlement, or not at all, that the consequences of the accident could be claimed in the future.
409	It's fine if you do it with good faith, but if you do it to shout "I have a bomb!" in public places and then justify it by saying you were speaking a new language and that was the sole purpose of your invention of a new language in the first place, then it won't help you, and you'll be convicted of "making a terrorist threat."
410	I think that should be ruled out as inadmissible evidence and thrown out immediately. It's an inadmissible testimony.
411	Well, since she's signed, she's legally obliged to be held accountable. And, no, she can't get her name off the loan, by disputing the signature on the promissory note, otherwise she's stuck. And, no, he won't get off scott free either, because he can use his tax return to pay for it. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no, he won't get off scott free either. And, no
412	I guess the feminists still follow Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer minorities' children.
413	They don't do that. It's Hollywood. I've been in court many times, not as a witness, and I haven't seen them do anything like that. They just want you to raise your right hand and say "I swear that the statement I'm about to make is the truth." Or something like that.
414	You're not sure you've accurately reported the information your lawyer gave you? If your car is parked on the private property of your employer, your state law may allow them to enforce that policy. Regardless of your opinion of that policy, you're probably an "at will" employee unless you're a union member. I don't know any state or federal law that protects you from dismissal for violating that policy. So you have two choices: stop smoking, or leave the premises to smoke.
415	It's still considered a violation of the right to the road, whether or not they're idiots. There are a lot of drivers here in New England and I'm sure elsewhere who drive for miles with their lights on, and I'm waiting for them to actually turn around and go.
416	Doctor, you have to be very careful. I'm a writer and former police officer. These people will have you surgically remove their boots from your own. Send a formal certified letter to the original publisher of the material, along with a form of consent for use of the material, and if they don't respond, extract the information from another source. Protect yourself, my friend. Their lawyers will eat your lunch and won't leave you a Twinkie.
417	Because they haven't thought about it properly. Like the rest of us, including you, many of their opinions are mixed with others' opinions, which makes them inconsistent.
418	I agree, it's barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that a pervert who raped and murdered a child still has human rights and the right to live? We would put down a dangerous dog, why not do the same for some of the scum who live in our country.
419	You've admitted guilt here and I'm sure you've admitted guilt there too.
420	I'm trying to teach my kids to "treat others as you wish them to treat you, not how they treat you". Two negatives make a positive in math, so torturing anyone or anything is completely unacceptable. Those who think that's okay are completely wrong and will change their minds when they're tortured.
421	I'm a felon who has a gun, so don't break the law and you won't lose your rights.
422	The emergency petitions are not arrests, nor are they available to the employer to review. The American Disabilities Act prevents this, and gives you grounds for a lawsuit if it is used against you. You need to inform your employer of your condition, if you are fired, you will file a claim with the ADA, and the chances are that the ADA will deny your claim if you did not inform them of your condition prior to employment. After the ADA reviews your claim, you will receive a "right to sue" letter, and you will be given a "right to sue" letter. You will then be given a "right to sue" letter, and you will be given a "right to sue" letter, and you will be given a "right to sue" letter. You will then be able to get a lawyer involved, and he will argue that you did not inform your employer of your condition prior to employment because you would not have hired you in the first place. Many lawyers work in a pro bono basis, and have a field day with these types of employers.
423	Well, it would've been nice if you'd used spell check first, and I'm sure it would've been a foolish thing to do at my age. I've been through two previous marriages where the ex-husband left me for cheating, and I wasn't to blame, so we should have studied that aspect more, don't we? Sorry, I don't agree with your logic or attitude. I apologize, but you couldn't have made it work. How could you ever prove it?
424	I think that if a law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, for instance, if it is not broken, it is quite acceptable to break it.
425	All right, I'm not going to say this publicly, but I really liked Battlefield Earth. The acting isn't very good, but it's a decent Sci-Fi movie, with some action. I liked the idea of post-war America, with some shout-outs to Fort Hood, Knox and a few other famous towns. The learning machine allows humans to become intelligent, Travolta getting his comeuppance at the end. I'm going to say, if it's on, I'm going to watch it.
426	Before that, here's a definition from the Oxford Dictionary: "Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings." Explicit: "Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion." I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because they are "pornographic" when the text is not sexy or titillating, but rather descriptive. Some don't even include real descriptions of sex at all. I cannot find a citation right now [on mobile] but I have heard many people say that the community should define the term "pornographic" without understanding of the difference between pornographic and sexually explicit.
427	I'm thinking that it doesn't matter which party wins, it doesn't matter which party they belong to. I mean, it doesn't matter if they're Liberal, Conservative, NDP, it doesn't matter if they're Liberal, Conservative, NDP. It just matters that they're all in the same place.
428	Instruments are so far from being a normal composition program that I think they're obsolete in the modern music world. They have imperfection, and you can't control the frequency of the sounds you're making. People spend years learning how to make one sound instead of all the possible ones. It's like being a soldier versus being a president. It's like being a soldier versus being president.
429	I have been stuck in this debate for months now, and I cannot think of a proper moral path.. I have always thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food, not fun, is morally right because there animals do not understand death, like humans do, and will have the same wonderful life in the wild, even if I kill them.. And I am a vegan now because I hate the fact that we get our meat from people who treat animals with unnecessary cruelty, or at least it seems that they do, and I am asking if it is wrong to eat meat from those factories.
430	-I'm expecting a scientific degree, and a bachelor's degree isn't very good, because prestige comes when you reach a PhD. -I don't have much emotional connection to the college I'm finishing. -The college isn't very good, and the subjects I'm studying aren't very vigorous, so I didn't learn as much as I could have done, and it's embarrassing to me to attend a ceremony that shows little dedication to studying and finishing the course work.
431	After a marriage ends, if the prenup has not been signed, the partner usually gets alimony from the other. I think it's wrong and selfish for the person receiving it. If someone gets divorced from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand over their hard work for money. It's stupid.
432	I've often heard references to other bands' goodness and Nirvana being a little bit of a novelty, but I've listened to a lot of other bands, like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and so on, and I must admit I've never heard anything like "Lithium" or "Smells Like Teen Spirit" before, and I'm sorry to say I've never heard anything like that before.
433	I'm looking at Reddit and there seem to be long sections of comments that I don't understand. People talking about Spaghetti, Transformers movies, Karma pouring out of the tube, no original idea, it's a mess.
434	It's a good idea to use privilege in any discussion, but it's just a way of arguing ad hominem rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable discussion. Even if someone's opinion is really distorted due to their divergent experiences due to social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is a good way of proving them wrong.
435	The IAmA submission by the man who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" the animal kingdom is a hypocrite.
436	The realism of games like Call of duty and Battlefield is similar to the training simulators of policemen and soldiers which are designed to teach people how to shoot other people. It seems illogical that the mind is not trained to be more violent through the media. In WW2 there was a serious problem with soldiers not shooting their weapons and not having the will power to, so the military started introducing a man-shaped silhouette to teach the soldiers how to shoot a human figure. Kids are taught that they can obtain points or a high score through human suffering.
437	I know it's a bad idea to give free rice to a third world country, but it's not the right thing to do. It's a short term solution to starvation, but it's a temporary solution that will hurt the farmers of that country.
438	I think that when people talk about privilege, they're forgetting the most important thing: the ability to think. If you're smart, you can be in a wheelchair and paralyzed and still be able to live in the world.
439	I don't think that any country should be allowed to remain a permanent member, and I think that the 5 countries with the biggest influence in the world (defined through a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records) will lose their seat. As for the rest of the seats, they would be filled as they are now. As for the veto power, I believe that it is overpowered, look at North Korea. I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to take action on an issue. I understand that this is two parts, but they go together, so I thought it should be OK to put them in one CMV.
440	I'm not talking about suicide as a choice, it's a fight or flight reaction, some people cope with it, others don't. I'm also not sure that people have an objective, inherent value and that disallowing them to end their lives is a way of allowing society to comfort them, rather than allowing them to end their lives peacefully.
441	I don't want to sound like I'm speaking badly about the dead, but I'm sure you know what it feels like.
442	I grew up in a patriotic area, and I was raised to despise Margaret Thatcher, when she was on hunger strike, and she died shortly thereafter, despite massive public outrage. She had been a great leader, and I met a man in London who thought she was a great leader, and I was surprised to find out that he was also called "the Iron Lady." I don't like her, and I don't like her.
443	I watched Drive in the theater several years ago and almost every friend of mine loved it. The reason they gave was the artistic cinematography, the great soundtrack, the great acting, etc.
444	I'm against HFCS because, in short, it kills people. While I understand it's cheaper, I don't think it's better. Examples: 1.) All artificial sugars have the potential to cause obesity or cancer. 2.) The factories producing HFCS are not regulated by the FDA, and tests have proven that some batches of HFCS contain mercury. 3.) HFCS and cane sugar are not biochemically identical, and our bodies do not process them the same way. 4.) The corn industry is very corrupt, and has caused local farmers to lose their business, which has hurt the US economy. I don't think that big companies like Coca-Cola and Pepsi should use HFCS because it has a terrible effect on product quality and health.
445	It happens all the time online and in real life. Someone says something, and another person says "that's racist," which is their trump card, and they feel it immediately discredits the other person's argument.
446	It's not really the same quality as the manga, but the storyline of FMA was very much focused on the 51 episodes, and it wasn't about the manga at all.
447	Although eBay is merely a market place where suppliers and consumers meet, I think eBay is better from an economic point of view. eBay's market is very much like an Internet-based free market where consumers pay the prices they wish to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they wish to supply. In other words, it is a self-targeting market which operates, with the exception of delivery problems, at its best. Amazon, on the other hand, used to target prices at certain users, who were more inclined to buy certain types of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop targeting prices. Now they set prices based on what the product suppliers set. They may not work at their best.
448	I'm sure Kingdom Hearts has some nice features, but you fight little black creatures called heartless and grey empty bodies called nobodys, and the biggest disappointment is that you can't beat Final Fantasy 7 on ratings any more.
449	Arguments about God's existence are, in fact, useless. There are arguments that can be disproved, but that cannot be disproved. There are no concrete arguments that can be put forward to prove or disprove God's existence, so that there is no need to debate whether he exists or not. It is all about faith.
450	Global warming is a global issue, hence the global part. America prides itself on its ability to rush into another country to "save" and "liberate" it from evil forces, even if the rest of the world disagrees.
451	I don't think the U.S. can seriously dictate to other countries if it doesn't obey its own Constitution.
452	- Let all children be wanted children. Knowing that you were unwanted but your parent was prohibited from having an abortion can be emotionally devastating for some. - Anyone who does not want their child so badly that they want to terminate it is not a good parent. The child will grow up without care and may be abused, malnourished or neglected.
453	The poor need help! If we do not intervene, the rich will become richer and the poor will become poorer. And it is bad for society to allow poor people to be exploited without any healthcare, political and legal representation, and a revolution will be spilled blood and will usually lead to a dictatorship.
454	I've just seen the original debate on TV in the House of Lords, and I wonder whether the added benefits of having all 7 Member States in the Council would have prevented the catastrophe of the engagement and subsequent occupation.
455	It isn't wise to rely on fossil fuels and such for the rest of our lives, but it seems to us that this is a major turning point for the future of the electric and other technologies. (Also, hydrogen is being studied right now and seems to be quite plausible as well.)
456	No, I'm not the one who started this debate, and I'm thinking that rugby is the better sport, because it's a combination of running and fighting, and they're running a lot, and they're constantly attacking and defending, and they don't have any timeouts or dead games.
457	It's a no brainer, coffee has no health benefits, but remember, stimulants and pleasant taste are not health benefits. On the other hand, Marihuana's active ingredient THC has been used for many health benefits for over 5000 years, but the stalk, leaves and seeds have also been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothing and other materials. No contest! Marijuana ranks high above coffee.
458	I don't know why you're forcing me to provide for my neighbor, but you're forcing me to give money to a charity without my consent. You're creating voluntary support associations with reasonable criteria for those who want to support, such as job or education, and then you're interested. You're giving tax breaks to those who make a contribution, and you're providing insurance benefits only to those who have already made a contribution, and you're forcing them to pay back the money they've received. And you're forcing them to pay back the money they've received, if you want. But don't tell me what a good cause it is. It's my decision.
459	College athletes do get paid. College education costs money, and if they're good enough and have a GPA, they're given scholarships that are basically debt relief. There's no difference between cashing a check for $1000 and using it to pay a credit card and a scholarship for $1000. The question is, should college sports be profitable or not? If it's a public school, the answer is obviously no.
460	We cannot confine our understanding of terrorism to Islamic extremists. We must consider all who attack civilian targets with violence with a view to spreading a message or causing fear to be considered terrorists.
461	As with all private schools, religious schools make money from their pupils directly, and this is not subsidized in any way, unlike public schools which must use community events and fundraisers. It is as if you gave money to a stranger and asked him to give it to charity, and you do not know what they will do with it and what will benefit their students.
462	I'm not sure how it would be a "valuable" lesson for most children, but I can tell you from personal experience. If you can properly discipline your child, there's no point in cutting his hair as a punishment. If you do decide to punish your child, there's better ways of teaching them what they did wrong.
463	Criminal gangs are criminal gangs, no matter who they are. If the police are not allowed to protect the population from criminal gangs, ordinary citizens will take up arms in order to defend themselves. This is not in the interest of the rule of law, so 'political correctness' must not be used to prevent the police from doing their job and protecting the public.
464	I've been to a ramen place down the street for a while and I've never been disappointed. I came here after hearing all the hype about pho and I'm not happy. I would definitely choose ramen over pho any day. The egg rolls were great and that was all that was good about the dinner.
465	We had a good time with the girls we were with, but I don't think we'll be back for the next girls night.
466	My family's been ordering from 109 for over 10 years, our phone number ends at 4949, and I've called them from my cell phone. The people who answer the phone are rude when they can't hear what I'm saying, and who answered 4:59pm today were rude to me. Two months ago, they messed up our order and the manager must have taught the employees how to act and talk unprofessionally. We've decided to go with Papa John's because at least their employees are professional and friendly. I hope they close this store because we don't know what they will put in our pizza.
467	I've always had a good experience here, but this time I was disappointed in the service. The food was good, but the waiter didn't take our drinks and dinner orders at the same time.
468	I've been here a lot of times and I really like it. It's a family business and they treat their customers very well. They take the time to talk to you about their menus and their specialties. My favorite dishes are the Carne Asada fries with Angus beef or Chicken Chimichangas. You can't go wrong with this place. I've always forgotten to come in and take advantage of it, but I don't mind paying even if it's the day after.
469	I don't think I'll ever go back there again. The bartender was rude, short and immature. We asked for chips and salsa and she said they only had nachos. We ordered quesadilla and she said they had sour cream and salsa and she said it wasn't on the menu. We asked her if she could bring us chips and salsa and she said it wasn't. We asked her if she could bring us salsa and she said it wasn't. We will never go back there again.
470	Our friend had a Mac and cheese and she said it was really good. She even bought wings because her husband loves them. The outdoor seats were very comfortable, although they let children in there on that day and they were definitely obnoxious.
471	The last thing that a school should do is to prevent its children's creative expression, their individuality.
472	He doesn't show the expressions of the children, and the uniforms don't show them.
473	I'd like to point out that high school students don't really understand what they are doing, and it's the opposite. It's a problem that students between 16 and 18 don't like to be limited, and sometimes it's a serious problem that leads to misunderstandings between parents and teachers.
474	Uniforms are not good for school. Students go to school to prepare for their future, not to waste money on uniforms.
475	Anybody who says Firefox 2 has serious memory leaks obviously hasn't used Firefox 2. The only memory problems I've encountered are when you open more than 20 windows at once or when you leave Firefox running for 3 hours or more (a known problem that can be remedied by a simple restart). And arguing for IE7 over Firefox... Weakness.
476	There's no reason to believe that IE is superior, because it's safer, faster, and more beautiful. You can modify it to suit your taste, and add any functionality you can think of. And it even has a more original name than IE does!
477	It happened, she made a mistake, and she will definitely learn from it. She was strong enough to tell me, something that no one else would have done. I'm pretty sure it wasn't easy for anyone to do, but they would have just remained silent and not told anyone. If that had happened, which I strongly doubt, I would have supported her and stayed by her side.
478	I'd never turn in my husband to murder, I'd do the exact opposite. I'd help him conceal all evidence, I'd move if we had to, and I'd never bring it up again. If my husband murdered someone, he'd know what he was doing, so it wouldn't be easy for me to turn him in.
479	You've seen the terrible arguments against books, like the guy who just said TV was awesome with a lot of exclamation points and capitals, clearly proving books are superior to TV because they rot the brain.
480	First of all, India has no potential to "rule" the world because you've seen the people. Good Indians with good minds are in some foreign country getting Nobel prizes, while others are just stumbling around doing nothing and pushing people who are just starting out. Nobody's letting anyone succeed, that's why!
481	Being fatherless would have ensured that his absence would be the only pain you'd feel, and that you'd never know what he was like.
482	This argument can be twisted, but I'd have to say that being fatherless is the better option, because in my opinion, a bad father is one who never comes to your aid when you need him, or never listens to what you have to say. And that's why being fatherless is better, in my opinion, because you can imagine your father as whatever you wish him to be, and that makes you a better man and a better man.
483	I'm not sure it's a bad thing to be without a father, but it's a good thing that he doesn't have a father. And I'm in the middle of this two choices, because I have a father, but he's not here in this country. I understand that he's gone back for a good reason, but I still need him here to give me support.
484	Raffles changed the rules and concepts Farquhar had laid down to suit the needs of the people when he returned after a long time, which could be seen as he cared.
485	Although Raffles had not worked closely with the populace in Singapore, he had prepared plans, ideas and was preparing to put them into action himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen.
486	The founder is not a person who "DISCOVERS" a place, if I understand correctly, I can say Prince Sanila Utama is Singapore's founder. And I know Farquer was very involved in this help, sometimes even doing all the work, but I would remind you that being a raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore, so he was given credit. Then I would like to ask you a question: why does the name "raffles institution" mean "raffles hospital" mean "raffles medical clinics"?
487	Pornography is wrong if it's not done in moderation. Porn addicts have intimacy problems in their relationships and mistreat and view women badly. Moreover, people addicted to pornography expect all women to be pornographic and behave as such, when in fact that isn't what sex is all about.
488	I've become suicidal thinking about the one I like most having sex with other women.
489	The example you've given is one of the early examples of scientific rigor: Charles Lyell and others in the 1800s proposed dates for rock strata, but radiometric dating was not invented until the 1900s, and when it was, the techniques were adjusted to match the dates he had proposed. This is a logical error, and it certainly doesn't appear to me as a real scientific rigor.
490	It doesn't matter if you believe in the Big Bang, but what caused it? And if it was caused by some gases reacting with one another, then where did it come from?
491	I meant that both moths were present at the time of the observation, and they were both colored, and that was the first indication of the fact that the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution.
492	We've reached a point where the only way to evolve in the 21st Century is to start creating. And that's evolution, only with a greater responsibility for humanity.
493	Could a perfect world, which seemed to have existed over 10 million years, when it really only existed for 150,000 years, have been created by an unproven higher power?
494	It seems that IE is much more compatible with spam and adware.
495	I think physical education should be compulsory for people who need exercise. If they don't exercise, they won't burn as much fat as they accumulate, and that's why they're fat. They need to be stricter in their PE classes, because they're mostly sitting around.
496	Phys Ed must be learned but not compulsory, because some of us are not fit for the extensive exercises.
497	It could also lead to a reduction in childhood obesity, because children are not subjected to physical exertion at home.
498	Definattley, all those obese children need exercise, and it's a vital part of life, of course, it should be mandatory.
499	I agree with her, children should learn how to live a healthy life, and schools should be required to follow stricter curriculums so that there are fewer obese people in our country.
500	Yes, our kids are mostly overweight and they're eating too much junk food.
501	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the starting point of Singapore, but the execution was left to Farquhar, so I believe he is the legitimate founder. Raffles was the 'idea man' before Singapore was founded, but he was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not make a significant contribution.
502	I believe that both of them are true: first things were created by God, I don't think Adam and I ever really were human, maybe single celled, but man had a hard time believing it, so we created the first creatures. Second things were created by God, I don't think Adam and I ever really were human, maybe single celled, but we created them anyway.
503	I'm not a god, I'm just using him for sarcastic remarks.
504	You're not a BMW, you're falling for the old "watchmaker" argument, and you're not even aware of the importance of self-replicating systems in a natural selection environment. Read "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins, not as aggressive as his more recent "God Dilusion," but as good as that.
505	I'm not mad about all these arguments about the link between porn and addiction, but I watch porn once or twice a day when I'm alone and I've got a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if I'm lucky!) a week, and we have fantasies that we want to fulfill.
506	I'm not worried about my boyfriend watching porn, I think it's just a natural thing to do. If people don't like the idea, they just don't watch.
507	When I'm volunteering at Irving Cares, it makes me feel so good to help the community. It's good for me to help others in the long run, whether it's a favor in exchange or something else. It's all about helping others, not me.
508	You can change the world forever by doing what our founders did, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., and many others did, and they are honoured for it.
509	Simply Written Seeking to advance the Common Good allows doors to open and obstacles to break, and after a journey or series of considerate acts one can have a less-difficult time Pursuing a "Personal" goal or lifestyle. The word for this debate is "sacrifice." How much would a person really sacrifice for his or her neighbor without being blinded by the light of selfishness?? No matter where a person is in his life... Remember, you may not know what they did (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
510	They prepare people for clothes they may need to wear later in life and ensure that no inappropriate clothes are used.
511	I'm trying to see things both ways, but I think it's better if I had a bad father, because growing up and becoming ready for life, you need to know life, and if you don't have an image or a person to look up to, life might be harder or worse.
512	It's better to have a bad father than not have one at all. You can still learn from him, "I won't be like him, I'll be better." Even if you have a bad father, he'll love you.
513	I wouldn't have lived my life right if I hadn't met my father. I wouldn't have lived my life right if I hadn't met my father, especially if I was a boy because most fathers are friends, so you can talk to them about your problems and they understand them, and you can't live with your mother because she's a woman and she doesn't think the same as a man.
514	Well, we could cover all of Mexico three times with our water bottles on Earth, and that would be a lot of "rich" Mexicans.
515	For instance, Pepsi Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani, both of which are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be bought at vending machines with soft drinks for the same price. If you can find a vending machine for $1, that's 5 cents a ounce. So they're basically filtered tap water, bottled close to the point where they're sold.
516	TV's better, 'cause you're sitting on the couch and you're able to look around the world.
517	Technically, I've learned English through dialogue with native speakers, but TV has helped me a lot more than books.
518	Children's academic skills are improved by watching TV. Children are more excited and confident about their studies. They have better ideas and innovations.
519	Over the past 10 to 15 years, the consumption of bottled water has increased exponentially, mainly in Europe and North America.
520	When it comes to drinking habits, we don't have the biggest problem with drinking water, but all other drinks use huge amounts of water and energy during their production, which has a far greater ecological impact than bottled water.
521	It should be a man and a woman who marry.
522	It is as if a newborn baby could not walk, I agree, there are many problems that India is facing today, but we are improving day by day.
523	Hi everyone, I am a new girl joining the forums who are in favor of this argument, and those who are against it. Please, I would like you to think before you tell about India's potential, because the wealth that foreigners are enjoying now is the looted one for India. The other foreign countries are more developed than us, because it is Indian people who use their brains to develop these countries.
524	Yes, India has the potential to become the world's leader. Hence, many countries depend upon scientists and Indian workers are employed in every country.
525	The same argument is used by religious people: you cannot prove he does not exist, you cannot refute the negative.
526	God's not real, so don't be so angry, dumb believers.
527	I'm thinking that spanking should be an option. Even though I think it should be an option, I think it's the last option.
528	I think that spanking your kid shows them what they've done wrong, and if they don't want to feel like they've made a mistake again, they won't make the same mistake again.
529	I've got a personal relationship with Christ, I believe.
530	I'm not sure how I'd live if I didn't believe in God, but it would be hell.
531	It's wrong, we shouldn't insult the ones we trust, we don't have to know what you think.
532	I mean, how could you possibly tell me how we got so perfect that the earth, sun, moon and hands fit perfectly in the right place, that our bodies function perfectly and our bodies were made to look like him? Because we were made to look like him.
533	People shouldn't hit their kids, because they'll think it's okay to hit someone else back, like at school, and they'll end up fighting and insulting other people.
534	No, 'cause they don't always have to be punished for everything they do.
535	Is humankind absolute or dependent on position? If a premature child lies in an incubator, let's say, a five gallon pail, then killing him is forbidden. Why is this so different just because the child is a womb?
536	I'm choosing life because keeping the law against abortion allows women to murder their unborn baby.
537	No, physical exercise has existed for over 200 years, and today it has barely been effective, mainly because children eat junk food. We should develop better ways of preventing obesity, such as the promotion of good eating.
538	Unless public education reforms, health classes can teach children about fitness and nutrition, if they don't know what they need to know about health and nutrition.
539	Well, I've got muscle cramps all over my body when I run, you know. Somebody might have more stamina and is suited to long runs and more intense exercises, but I've got less stamina and I'm only able to do light exercise. Why do people have to be the same?
540	Physical Education's a big problem, too, and we shouldn't need Phys Ed for college.
541	It is my opinion that a person should be free to do whatever he wants, so I don't care much about gay marriage. I think it's wrong in some ways, but it doesn't really make a big difference in society. If you want to do it, you make your decisions and choices. In some religions it's not okay, but I don't want to influence your thoughts. Life is what you want it to be.
542	I think that we humans are very selfish creatures, we only see things from our point of view and we think those who disagree with us are wrong.
543	Unfortunately, it's human nature to be selfish. It doesn't always mean that you'll always be a nice person and always do the right thing for yourself, but an individual usually helps himself first. Sometimes, in a good situation, you can go out for your own personal interest and contribute to the common good.
544	It is important to help others, but it is also a matter of time. It is a journey to fulfilment where one truly lives, and you must not forget those who are truly in need before helping others.
545	I don't think there's really a day when you announce to the world that you're going to help the common good, but you can help people around the world with a little bit of time and a little bit of cash, but ultimately, if you ever reach a position of power and have money, you can really help the common good.
546	Nobody's going to court with a sincere plea, nobody's going to court with a sincere accusation, nobody's going to court with empty pleas, they're lying, they're making a mess, they're making iniquity. And that's why justice's far away. It's because the truth has fallen from the public square, the uprightness has vanished, the truth isn't coming in, the one who escapes from evil is a prey.
547	CarCraze, I apologize, You have a legitimate court order that you must appear in court to answer a motion for collection of debt. If it is on paper and has a case number, call the court and ask for the date of hearing. Yes, they have that power. Yes, it is a subpoena. If you "just let it ride", as you say, do not be surprised when you open your paycheck and find a large amount of money gone. What you should do is consult a lawyer and come up with a reasonable repayment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditors and profitable for you. Do not hesitate, you will regret it.
548	We're all busy, but it's your civic duty to be present in court. There are certain criteria that will release you from jury duty, but you must still be present in order that the judge can examine your petition and decide whether you are legally disqualified.
549	There's been a movement here since Bush got away with a taxpayer dollars funding Faith-based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional, but no politician will touch it fearing that he would be labelled anti-church.
550	The question of whether he's slamming the baby, or is likely to be, is not my job, but I'm not a lawyer, so I can't say for sure.
551	You can't handle this all at once, theft is a crime, malicious prosecution and breach of contract are civil, and you can't do anything about it unless you have a lawyer.
552	Bush assumes the US will lose its edge in industrial production, and the agreement will tighten the rules on emissions from various sectors in America. To comply with the standards, America needs to upgrade many sectors. Another reason is that the other Third World countries are not able to afford the financial resources or expertise to implement the agreements. Hence, the Third World countries will pollute and produce low quality products while the US will invest in new technologies and produce expensive products. But in the long run, the US will benefit from the agreement, since we have only one Earth.
553	The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, is clear that if someone uses another person's computer service, in this case, a broadband connection, without their consent, he committed an offence. I am not sure about its history, but the law has been in force since 1993.
554	nuitsen I agree that this was not ethical and even insensitive, but it was done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly do not respect other beliefs and truths. What is the difference? s_s2 You do not see all the Muslim people who are not suicide bombers protesting against the suicide bombers when Islam, as we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who do not respect other beliefs. They are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq, but I do not see anyone protesting against that.
555	I don't mean to disrespect you, but it seems to me that you were selfish and demanding of him. Maybe I missed something. You should be happy that he was improving himself and developing his career. I would say, if that was the only thing that caused your breakup, then yes, you should get back together with him.
556	It depends on your state. In Nebraska the legal majority age is 19. In most states it is 18. But there are special circumstances in most custody agreements where support is necessary for high school. It seems to me that your daughter needs a quick kick in the pants. It is very difficult to deal with, watching your daughter self-destruct. It sounds like you have no choice. If she was still living with her father you should be giving him money towards her support. If she is "on her own" in her own apartment, you have no obligation to pay 18 year olds rent. I would tell her that she is on her own if she wants to go back to school, but if she wants to be a junkie, she is on her own. She can move into a Dope man's house, find a job, or join the army. All you can do is keep the lights on and pray, but you don't have to pay.
557	The U.S. is not trying to steal Iraq's oil, it needs to control the world oil trade and requires all oil producing countries to sell their oil dollars, effectively making American paper money redeemable in oil. Compliant Arab regimes also invest hundreds of billions of dollars of oil profits in the U.S. economy, if they are allowed to sell oil in Euros, they will invest their profits elsewhere and the US economy will suffer greatly.
558	I don't think it should be the government's choice, it should be the property owner's choice. I've yet to be in a place where smoke bothers me because most places don't smoke, bars here in Ohio aren't smoking, and that doesn't bother me at all. Maybe the next day after I smell my clothes and hair, but my breath stinks just as bad after a night of drinking. It's just a way of controlling and getting money. One of the issues on the ballot, if you read it closely, is money for the "clean air fund"...if they don't smoke, why would you need one? And what on earth are you going to do with that money? I prefer my money to go to my child's college fund, but if this passes, I won't have a choice, will I?
559	If you're watching your children, you shouldn't need a register to do that. It's your responsibility as parents to keep an eye on your children at all times.
560	As of 2006, a 17-year-old Georgian can't leave his parents' house without permission unless another guardian is appointed or you are an adult. Check with your local juvenile office if you are in doubt. The reason law enforcement doesn't enforce this is because it's going to cost millions of dollars to enforce and most cops aren't up to date on juvenile laws.
561	I'm not sure about the law of Louisiana, but I've never heard of a state enacting such a thing. Instead, it's a customary courtesy for employers and employees to give two weeks' notice before they retire. If you want a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference later, it's a good idea to give two weeks' notice, but I'd be surprised if it was mandatory.
562	You seem to be looking for something that discriminates against. If you don't pay your bills on time, be it white, black, purple or green, they have the right of ending their services to you. It sounds like they've given you at least a couple of breaks, and you've chosen not to do what's right, which is paying your bills on time. And yes, I have the right to say this, because I'm an American and proud of it, and I don't feel discriminated against because I'm paying my bills on time, even if they are late!
563	Sheriff's Department doesn't have a sale, they don't do creditors, liquidators, repossessors, salesmen. They're bluffing, they're laws. When a debby gets dues to expire, collection agencies get really aggressive in collecting.
564	No one objected to the extradition of criminals who committed crimes, but justice should be served even if criminals flee.
565	It was probably not stupid when it was passed, but it was probably stupid now that it is.
566	The Nazis didn't just hate each other, they did what they thought was right. "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good intentions". They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but Jewish people and others weren't in that category. They did everything they could to make the master race happen.
567	I don't care what anyone else thinks, a child needs a mother and a father, not two women or two men.
568	The vast majority of answers above make the same mistake that the question implies. The "freedom of religion" right is not the problem, it's the Establishment Clause. "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion" is the wording that says that no law respecting the establishment of religion can be made. It's a purely hypocritical and a form of religious discrimination. And while people have a right to do so on a personal level, they cannot do so under the law.
569	It's a good idea, because everyone in school is on the same level, at least in terms of appearance.
570	No, any society that values the value of human life and promotes nonviolent solutions would be hypocrites in including capital punishment in its justice system. There is always a risk that innocent people will be executed under a flawed justice system. Whereas the decision of the penalty is made by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences will be imposed according to prejudiciality.
571	If you mean that the government interferes with our parenting and responsible adults' ability to teach our children, then no. As for the FCC and what is transmitted via the airwaves and is accessible to the public, it should also set absolute specifications for such media outlets. But, as far as moral standards are concerned, parents should simply get their butts off and teach their children right from wrong, talk to them and maintain an open dialogue.
572	I've always thought that I'm Irish and I don't complain about Notre Dame's nickname, "The Fighting Irish," or that people mock me because I like fighting. It's ridiculous. If any Native Americans care about these things, why don't they look at poverty on reservation, poor education, etc.
573	The answer is no, but I think the bigger problem is to figure out who leaked this information. There's a lot of Clinton era hold-overs in newspapers. Newspapers are in the business of criticizing Bush, so they're going to do anything to stop the war effort and then hide behind the freedom of the press. They're killing people and extending the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
574	You don't need a piece of paper to prove you're married and you want a lifetime commitment from the person you love most, just tell her you're her wife and organize a ceremony somewhere you both find attractive and discuss your future and express your love for one another. And don't forget to think about it every day for the rest of your life, because that's what it's all about.
575	Your client? I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're talking about, but you're a crack pot conspiracy theorist. First, there's no coherent question in your tirade of poorly formed English sentences, and second, your racist charges in your "question" are suspect.
576	You should consult a lawyer who is registered in your state for the most up to date information.
577	It's boring, it's kind of scary. I don't want to complain about the usual sex, the shower time is going to be a bit long, I'm not going to complain about the fact that I'm not in a good mood.
578	In the United States, there are literally tens of thousands of water companies regulated by various federal and state authorities, and if they comply with those regulations, there's no reason to sue them. But if you don't like tap water, you can drill your own well, install a filter system or buy bottled water. But if you try to sue a water company, unless you prove negligence, you'll lose.
579	Yes, but no; in the short run, the retailer would have to order more fur, but in the long run, if activists continued to do this, it could be so costly that the retailer would reconsider buying the merchandise it could not sell.
580	The law in the present case is governed by rules of conduct and obligations which the client is obliged to accept. In that sense, the law is ethical, because it provides a framework for "fair play". However, the lawyer's job is to win the case against his client, and using loopholes in the law is one way of doing that. In some cases, it is not ethical. However, the legal system in place provides the best way of rectifying a wrong, since the party concerned feels that its claim has not been dealt with fairly and fairly within the scope of the law, may, in certain cases, bring proceedings in the courts of appeal. This is the best way of rectifying a wrong, and that is what the public will accept.
581	First of all, is your boyfriend a worker or a slave? Second, unions are legal and allowed to form. But this sounds a bit far, unless your boyfriend has done something like crossing a picket line, he better know he won't be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. And secondly, is he really an illegal alien? Then the INS could come in and send him back.
582	I know that it's not always the case that you're very smart and have poor grades, but it's not a bad thing to be poor at school. I've heard the argument that there are people who know stupid people who have good grades, but I don't understand.
583	I've been gradually losing faith in morality, and I find it odd. There's a strange quality that lies beyond the physical realm and cannot be justified (because it's hard to jump from something existing to something moral without any kind of axiomatic), and yet we're bound by it. And I don't see any reason why we should be tangled in it. *Why* should I believe in some magical rule that the world is clearly explainable without it? *Why* should I believe that it's just a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behaviour, when I compare a world with moral meaning to one without the latter, it seems far simpler and simpler, with less baggage. CMV, please.
584	The government should pay for programs that feed, house, educate and care for every single person.
585	I used to watch this show with my family, but it's just a cheap sex joke and I'm ashamed to watch it anymore.
586	I understand that there are studies showing that young men can be more reckless than women, but that should not be a reason to treat men differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78% of the US population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the US population, accounted for 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the US population, accounted for 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because they are statistically more in prison? No. This is a good analogy to why men should be treated differently just because they are statistically more in prison. I'm not a'masculinist,' but it just seems unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read ]
587	I agree with Grey that news websites and TV stations are obsolete for anyone seeking important information on current affairs. Most news either doesn't affect my life or will disappear or become irrelevant in a matter of months. I don't say they're useless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but there are enough specialist sources for a more in depth critique or explanation of current affairs, and Twitter/reddit provides me with information relevant to my life.
588	I've seen the usual explanations and I still don't understand why they do this. They do a service that doesn't need to be provided for us. They're working hard and usually they get paid enough to cover the state and federal taxes that are imposed on their salaries. They're evaluating their performance based on whether or not they tip their servers. Be brutal, kind, or whatever you want. Just be rational.
589	I don't see any benefits in government recognition of marriages. First, the benefits are that marriage is not contested anymore. Second, the government doesn't care. Third, the benefits are that marriage is possible. Fourth, the benefits are that marriage is possible.
590	People always talk about how unfair discrimination is, but I've seen a lot of discrimination and hatred towards the rich, especially on Reddit. I think that discrimination is just as wrong as all other forms of discrimination. America is always talked about as a free society and equality, but how can it be free and equal if it charges people more for being more productive? And that encourages people to do that in other countries where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects, and our subsidies to the poor have increased the number of poor by millions.
591	I see the headlines "ISRAEL BOMBS GAZA; WANT TO STOP DESPITE KILLING CIVILIANS" every time I watch the news.
592	The smaller the political body, the more people are in control. The best size for a political unit is a town big enough to benefit from the advantages of scale (shared risks, joint efforts in public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, inefficient bureaucracy).
593	It wasn't until 1913 that the moustache became a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. It was a secret desire to return to barbarism and project their hipster, or rather Hitler, tastes and preferences into the populace through force. And worse still, America's rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollow inside the hipster that can only be filled with a pillow of moustache, quality coffee and eventually fascism.
594	I'm aware that this is a sensitive issue and most people will accept capital punishment, but I feel that we let them go too easy and they'll think it's okay to do it again and again. Honesty, if some ludicrous person did this to your child and caught them, what would you do? I'm only 23 and this subject angers me greatly. I chose the age of 30 because I believe the age gap between 30 and 17 is too large. I feel that this should only be done for crimes of sexual nature, because I don't think anybody could have been attracted to murder, but castration would be a proper punishment. I believe castration would be a proper punishment because you wouldn't really be able to rape a child without a penis.
595	I don't say rape is wrong, but consensual sex with a girlfriend isn't wrong, and putting the two of them in the same context of a'sin' is a'sin'.
596	I've been studying this economic doctrine for some time, and I don't see how you can still defend it as ethical or particularly effective in 2014.
597	I had already thought that George W Bush would be the worst president ever, but now that we've seen Iraq unravel, I'm sure of it. Here's a list of his mistakes: 1. Not taking the time to think about the 9/11 attacks. 2. Trying to build a nation in Iraq with a completely fake pretext, which destabilised the region as we've seen now. 3. Trying to build a nation with a completely fake pretext, which destabilised the region as we've seen now. 4. Trying to build a nation with a completely fake pretext, which destabilised the region as we've seen now. 5. Cutting taxes on the rich, which led to the biggest deficit and debt in history, which resulted in massive spending cuts on social services during the Great Depression. And probably many more I'll be leaving out, but I think this is enough to get this conversation off the ground.
598	The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda to prevent children from realising their autonomy and is a major reason for the increase in school shootings.
599	I think it's the combination of football and soccer that makes America so attractive, while Ireland has football and Gaelic football.
600	I've finally made it to mid-career management in my 30s, and I'm under pressure to move to where my significant other lives and works. I don't speak his language, although I'm learning it, I'm speaking it at elementary level. CMV. What beliefs do you have that can make me move to be with someone I love, but will make me give up everything in my home country? What other things should I be thinking about for those who must have made those choices?
601	Powermat is being installed in 100,000 locations across the U.S. If the next iPhone has a built-in PMA component, Qi will lose the war. Apple users are often Starbucks and Teavana regulars, so it's convenient for them. PMA will be installed everywhere for the 50 percent of smartphone users in the U.S. who have an iPhone and Qi will die. CMV I don't want this to happen. I support Qi and I don't like the way PMA transmits information (pushed ads) that it can do, so I want someone to give me hope for Qi. Please. Thank you.
602	In fact, if the teams were forced to spread over the entire surface, they would have had more space to pass, shoot and generally exciting offensives. This would have made the games much more exciting and, in my opinion, more entertaining.
603	I've been following UFOs for a couple of years now, and I've gradually changed my mind that all UFO stories can be based on hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony. Similarly, many credible sources of eyewitness testimony, such as the various military personnel involved in the Disclosure Project, have turned out to be pursuing money and or simply lying about their expertise, such as Bob Lazar, who claimed to work at Area 51. I would love to believe that aliens have been visiting Earth and it's all a big cover-up, but I can't think of a single credible example that hasn't been thoroughly discredited.
604	It's just a reminder that men have to play traditional roles, like providing for their families, being responsible and protecting them. It's the equivalent of "be more ladylike".
605	The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of Islam and Christianity, as a perpetual flame of torture or metaphysical torture, specifically designed for those who do not belong to the faith or do not believe in God or do not believe in the wrong God, is the least morally justified idea I can imagine. The suffering that this worldview causes, if true causes, cannot be compared to anything that all humanity has ever done.
606	I admit, I'm a fan of Daisy, and I'm aware that her voice is irritating, but I'm also fond of her. And that's all right, I'm gonna admit, I'm a fan of her.
607	I've been fascinated with economics and money my whole life, and I remember thinking about what qualities a "perfect" money would have, since I see many flaws in the current "candidates" e.g. gold,dollars,euro,etc. As a result, I believe market forces will push more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior currencies in the market place) until Bitcoin consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency. I've done a lot of FMA (failure mode analysis) on this, and I'm very sure that it's inevitable. I invested all my life savings in Bitcoin. Can I change my mind?
608	I don't mean that Neil deGrasse Tyson did a bad job, but it would have been more appropriate and symbolic to have Bill Nye, who has spent so much time trying to get knowledge to be heard as narrator and tour guide for the Cosmos series, inspiring the next generation of thinkers.
609	I don't want to sound like a snob, but I've been studying at university and I've gotten good grades. I've gotten mostly First Class grades this semester, while my friends get 2:1s and 2nds. It's becoming an expectation that I'll get Firsts, and so when I get good grades, I get replies like "of course" or "is that it?" from my peers. I don't mean to be arrogant, but they feel that I should be 'grateful' for my grades, despite the fact that I've spent a lot of time planning and writing in my work. I feel pressured to keep up with them, but I don't know if I'm being a dick or if I'm justified in feeling that people expect me to get top grades.
610	I've just finished a marathon series, and I've noticed that the first three episodes were more enjoyable than the last three. The plot was very interesting, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the Jedi, the role of the Jedi, and so on. But I also noticed that the first three episodes were more interesting than the last three, in order of their appearance in the series, and I think that's a good thing.
611	METAL IS EVIL. First of all, the symbolism it contains can be interpreted as evil by a fifth grade student. Second, their lifestyles, most of them have a very sinful and evil lifestyle.
612	Ladies and gentlemen, if you do not know about the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by George W. Bush, because of the many instances of "misinformation" that have been spread, or perhaps not because of them, we must all agree that Bush should be impeached. Remember, while Bush is not currently the worst, he is among the worst, and we must find someone more competent in the field of politics and world affairs who will lead us into this period of need for leadership, albeit only for two years.
613	Firstly, gold is unreliable and too slow to grow. Our economy will not catch up with it, and banks will collapse. Secondly, the government loses income, stopping our ability to implement fiscal policies and adjust to recessions and overheating.
614	People always keep their views on religion, no matter what. They were raised that way.
615	I'm not saying I'm not interested in science and technology, but when the world is suffering from war, starvation, job loss, what do we hope to gain other than curiosity?
616	No, the world won't end, NASA's still looking, and we won't get hit, I think it was 3000 years ago, the funny thing is, I made a bet with my friend if the world doesn't end in 2012, I get $5, if it does, he gets $5, he said "If we see asteroids I have to pay up" I can't wait for that $5, the Master Chief
617	Yes, I do believe that in the early stages of life, the physical punishment is more effective than the verbal punishment. I do not think that it is possible to label a bad parent if he occasionally hits his children. This method of disciplining has been part of the parenting doctrine since the beginning of man. It is effective and harmless if it is used properly.
618	My friend is, in my opinion, a fool. She's moving to Texas, and there's only 13% whites in town, mostly gang territory, not far from Mexico's border. She's leaving everything behind, including family and friends, and most people advise her to stay.
619	He was a genius when he was ten years old, he had a 180 IQ and he'd been able to skip between 4th and 10th grade, he'd been able to do the work without any trouble, he'd also been teaching the 10th grade class, and he'd had a lot of arguments with the teachers, and he'd always been correct.
620	Isn't it just that the year starts in the middle of winter, so that each year has two winters? Why would we want to break our weekends so that they're only one day long at each end? A week at work is five days, then two days of play, then another, then another, then another. And then the weekend is two days long, but that's not all. I'm more comfortable with calendars starting on Sundays, because they're more beautiful (symmetries), but the week starts Monday, so that the week ends on Monday.
621	I had a terrible experience when I walked in, the place was empty, and my friends and I had decided to sit alone. The cook said that they could not serve us because they had no plates. When we did not leave after she said that, she proceeded to make a clever remark to convince us to leave. We did not leave until there was only one other customer in the place. I do not understand why they were open 24 hours, if they were not busy.
622	I cannot believe I did not write a review for this place. It is inside the Planet Hollywood and it is open 24 hours. It is a great place to go when you have the munchies while your Recommendations: Full Montagu..Beef and turkey..Its a very tasty sandwich. Holiday Turkey..Wow it tastes like a turkey plate with stuffing, turkey and cranberry. Very good if you like turkey.
623	The concept of the individual portions is very innovative and the service was very good, although it became a bit of a "Where's Waldo" situation when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. The New York Steak was really good at the buffet, and I really liked the miso shrimp salad. I'd like to come back for dinner, as we came during the Brunch.
624	The chicken tenders and fries are very good, and you get a piece of toast or cole slaw as an extra. It's a bit more expensive than I expected, but it's adequate for the quality and quantity. The staff is nice and quick, and the drive-thru is usually quick. Overall, a decent fast food place for lunch or dinner.
625	I've been to New Way a few times, and I've been impressed with the service and the food. The place is never too crowded, so you can always have a delicious meal without breaking the bank. The chicken sandwich was great, as well as the hot Italian sausage sandwich, which was on special. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who lives near the Arsenal.
626	We've been there twice now and we won't be back again. The first time we were okay, but the steaks were overcooked. We decided to give them another chance and order rare steaks. The second time it took us 20 minutes to get seated and another 15 minutes to get our food. And when we got it, the steaks were overcooked again, even though we ordered rare. The vegetables were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats everything you put in front of him, took one bite of the grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. When we got it back, it took another 7 minutes to get someone to call us and apologize. She said "sorry, $34.24" and we said "I'm sorry, I should have just left. I wouldn't feel guilty, it was disgusting.
627	Pizza was alright. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay, they'll turn on the touch screen display so you can pay after they swipe your card, show you the order total, and if you want to leave a tip, you have to hit 'no'. I'd guess that for take out orders, they wouldn't ask for a tip at all. They didn't have a menu, you had to look at the wall with the chalk menus. It said it would take about 9 minutes to cook and it ended up being 28 minutes. It's a new place with a 97.5 sanitation rating.
628	Students should be allowed to express themselves, and with their uniforms, they're all alike, which is boring.
629	I think they're bad because I think you should be free and nobody's gonna tell you what to do.
630	It is true that school uniforms are used by the school where my mother works, and by the school district where my cousin's 3 children go to. The reason is that they are used to reduce bullying, which is not really addressing the problem of bullying.
631	Students have the right way of feeling and expressing themselves, but it's wrong. It's the learning that makes us smart.
632	You have to choose your own clothes after you've finished school or college or something like that.
633	I've come to realize that what works for one person is good, and what I've been using for a long time, is a lot better than Internet Explorer. The configuration isn't too bad, and those of you who know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and there are a lot of good extensions. Though it's not the best, it's definitely superior to Internet Explorer, especially after the ridiculous 7 update.
634	The second paragraph of your argument isn't worth arguing against, since it doesn't contain any facts and really isn't an argument at all.
635	I'd rather not turn my wife in, 'cause I love her and we've been married for a reason. I'd rather believe that she killed somebody for a legitimate reason, 'cause murder is still murder.
636	I'm sure I'd stick with my vows of marriage through good times and bad, but some people get married without really knowing who they are. Hmm, that's a difficult thing to do. I've made a promise to them that I would help them when they were in trouble until our souls parted, but I don't know if it's a tough thing to do.
637	Books are better than TV because TV can blind you, and your eyes hurt a lot if you watch too much.
638	Books are better than TV because most kids watch TV because it influences them in a bad way, and most parents don't care what their children watch. I'm thankful books are better because you learn more from them.
639	I am a class 11 student and I have to participate in the Debate. That's why I asked you, please give me more information and I will be very grateful to you
640	India's population is increasing, and less land means a lot of people in every place.
641	I'd rather not have a father who hasn't done anything for me, because the odds are you and him won't see each other five years from now, so why bother trying to make it work when you've already known the outcome.
642	It's possible, but it's better not to have a bad father, because sometimes he bothers you and makes you do things you don't like. But that's just how a father is. You still have other people to admire, even if your father isn't with you.
643	I think it's better if you're a bad father than a good father, because your bad father will influence you badly. Maybe you'll follow your father as he is, but if you're a bad father, it'll be okay, but not great, because you won't like being a bad father.
644	I'd say that fathers should be the ones who provide for the family and solve problems that come up because they're like the alpha males, but if they're not good enough, why should you be around? Children see their fathers as an example of how to be a man and responsibility for the actions he takes.
645	As a young man, you hope that when you need a father figure, you'll be there for him.
646	Raffles had a vision of Singapore, which he had worked for, and which he had been working on, and while he was away Farquhar had developed Singapore poorly, which made Raffles unhappy.
647	Although Farquhar was said to have stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles had prepared the plan, the strategy, and had chosen Singapore as another British base, giving early British support to Singapore. If William Farquhar had been declared the founder because he had done the "work" instead of the contractor, why had the supervisor of the construction site been paid more than the contractor, and not by free will had he left Singapore?
648	I agree that William Farquhar remained in Singapore to continue the business and to develop it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he must have left and returned to Bencoolen, and also laid the foundations for Singapore's development, so he should be considered as its founder.
649	Schooling Raffles established the Singapore Institution, now called Raffles Institution, in 1837.
650	Raffles had envisaged a city plan for Singapore which would include separate areas for ethnic groups and a provision for other facilities such as roads, schools and land for government buildings in October 1822.
651	Raffles found Farquhar had done a poor job of building Singapore, and he had brought opium to Singapore for the purpose of making more money for Singapore.
652	If you lived in those conditions for just one month, it would have been a surprise if you hadn't caught a disease every day. Hospitals were built by raffles, and that saved a lot of people at that time because the living conditions there were terrible. Another reason he'd helped develop:
653	It's wrong, it's unhealthy, it's addictive, but it's not supposed to exist because it's wrong.
654	If you're in a relationship, then yes, pornography is wrong. No one has the right to say what to do, we can only hope to influence it. It's disgusting, it's exploiting men and women, it's unrealistic, it can destroy a relationship.
655	Okay, do you think that God created them and then changed them through evolution? We'll all find out in the next 100 years anyway.
656	Ah yes, the old argument about the peppered moths I've known very well, but I don't know how it proves evolution. Both colors are always present, it's just a matter of which one is easier for the prey to see.
657	Evolution is as likely as a tornado ripping open a junkyard and assembling a 747.
658	I'm not using IE, but FFX has many problems. First, it takes a long time to start, unlike the Opera browser, which takes much less time. Second, the plug-ins I use frequently don't work well with FFX, and the Flash movie doesn't play smoothly on FFX, unlike Opera which plays Flash movies smoothly. Thirdly, Firefox is still very young, and I think it's better than IE. But Opera is still the best.
659	(I'm writing this using Firefox) Besides emotions, Firefox doesn't have ActiveX support, so it's not usable at all for the new Windows Virtual Earth tool.
660	Chorme's better than all of them, it's faster, safer, and it's also open source, like Firefox.
661	Even though Raffles had done all the planning, Farquhar had to make some of his own plans, too, because he was leaving for Bencoolen.
662	Farquhar played the role of "mother" to Singapore, and he did more for Singapore than Raffles, which made him a founder of Singapore.
663	I'm going to take the Obama approach to this abortion, it's never a woman's thing to take lightly, there's always going to be a lot of thinking, asking for help, and praying involved. The pro-life people don't seem to understand that we also think this is a horrible thing, and we pro-choice hope nobody ever has to face this difficult and life-changing situation.
664	If a woman is raped and left with a vile child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should be allowed to give up on that child.
665	I'm against abortion, but I believe in the right to choose. What matters to a pregnant woman is not what I think or what the majority thinks.
666	Pro-choice is the only constitutional option in the United States of America, but people everywhere else in the world do whatever they like.
667	How could you have been raised like that? Did you attend church, Sunday school, pray before meals, pray at school, pray at night? I remember when I was seven and asked questions about God and the Lord's Prayer. It didn't make sense. So I stopped believing in God and stopped praying. Thankfully, my public school system stopped that.
668	There's no concrete proof that a god exists, religion and the bible are full of contradictions and changes that I'm becoming less and less convinced that a god exists.
669	It seems to me that the common good is more important, because it is more important to give than to receive. It is more important to give your hand to someone else than to hold it yourself.
670	It is better for me to be involved in both, but I would like to make this society more fair, more honest, more productive, and everyone knows what they want to be. They go out and pursue their dreams without help from others, but some others will help the community to be safer and more pleasant. They teach them what they are capable of, they convince themselves that they can do the things that wealthy people do.
671	I think it's better if we focus on the well-being of everyone else rather than ourselves, because it would be a lot worse if we pursued our own personal interests.
672	As a result, student victimization is likely to be reduced, fighting and gang activity is likely to be reduced, as there is a smaller competition for the most fashionable clothes.
673	Yes, of course. School uniform is important. It's a logo for our school. It reminds us that we belong there. And if we don't have it, the teacher will punish us. We can learn how to behave in a disciplined way. And if we leave the school, the teacher will see that we have used the uniform.
674	It'd be better if you didn't have a father, than if you didn't have a father. And if you grow up without a father, you'd always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is bad, it could make you work harder to be better than him. And it could make you start being responsible sooner, because your father doesn't care about anything. Like my brother and I, my father is bad, but I'm still happy that I know who he is. Because I can't imagine wondering about it.
675	I'm thinking it's better to have a bad father than to be without a father, because growing up without a father can be difficult for some children. For instance, some children need fathers to teach them the right way, but if you have a bad father, you have someone who can at least support your decision and encourage you.
676	I think it's better to have a bad father than not have a father, because a father is a big influence on a child, and if he doesn't have a father, he doesn't feel safe.
677	Water from a bottle is not strictly regulated as is tap water, so you don't know what you're drinking when you drink bottled water.
678	Yes, I think that water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless it's an emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a while, and they're not recycled, and they end up in landfills which pollute our environment. They take 700 years to break down. And 90% of the cost is the bottle itself.
679	In the last year alone, more than 1.5 million barrels of oil were used to manufacture the plastic bottles that were consumed in the United States, and that's not counting the oil used to transport them.
680	In 2006, 18 million gallons of bottled water were shipped from Fiji to California, causing approximately 2,500 tons of global warming pollution.
681	If you don't save a bottled water in case of emergency, you don't think about the future, you think about the present.
682	Nowadays, no one lives without television. It's common to watch TV with everyone, so...TV is better than books.
683	Television is important in terms of communication, because it goes beyond the limit of the category.
684	Because it's a source of entertainment, and it helps people who can't read.
685	Water bottles are thrown out and polluted as long as people recycle the environment. It is not the fault of the water companies.
686	Marriage is a matter for the Church, Congress cannot pass a law forcing religious institutions to decide. Perhaps, if the courts allow gay marriage, it would be okay since it is not a religion, and it does not violate the separation between church and state established by the Supreme Court.
687	Gays are making a terrible mistake, I think, and they're living their lives right now without any commitments. It would be a lot better if it were like this in normal marriage.
688	We have the potential, but China is the only competitor who has done a lot better in the long run. But the way India operates, it always brings order out of chaos.
689	Why don't you mind the other options, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism, etc.
690	Christianity: belief in rape, genocide, hellfire, unfounded claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc. Atheism: rejection of these claims based on logic, observation and common sense
691	It's called "faith" in God, and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist. The idea that God is false is your own, and I don't have to deal with it. We don't have to deal with it. The two of them contradict each other, and they don't win. It's probably a battle between two armies that doesn't end well.
692	I was raised in a Baptist Church, and I've been fortunate to come across a church full of people who are kind and do what they preach. Now I consider myself a nondenominational, who fully believes in the beliefs and teachings of Christians, but now I see it as a belief in God rather than religion.
693	I'm a Christian, because I believe in a just God who will bring ultimate justice for all the right and wrong things that have been done here on earth.
694	I'm not a Christian, but if you are a Christian, you really can't argue with them unless your argument is based on the same thing. Like Street fighting and UFC, different platforms.
695	If God does not exist, why do so many prophecies, sent by God thousands of years before Christ, which say exactly what happened to him?
696	It must not be compulsory, but at least a requirement, but not more often. What would you consider if the child is ill, and you separated the boys from the girls, so that they could play some good games of PE, and so did the girls, so that they could play games that inspired their ideas.
697	Honestly, who cares about it, if people want to be together, it's fine. It's not like marriage is some kind of holy thing, we sell it on TV, in drive-thru, etc., and it's fake love. If people really want to be together, who's to say no? If you don't like what they do, you shouldn't be their friend. And what about your kids, who's gay?
698	Three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups, especially against gay marriage, and they're extremely biased. I didn't even have to look at the sites to find out.
699	The ban on gay marriage and other laws are only there because of the religious right that seems to be invading America.
700	There's a debate about whether gay marriage is acceptable or not, but I think everybody should have the right to express their feelings for someone they love. Why can't a man express his feelings for a woman or a man and a woman who is gay, but not for a woman? I think gays should have the right to do what they like when they want to!
701	I think it's better to pursue your own interests, because it's natural to help yourself first and that's what makes life worth living.
702	I'm thinking your personal interest should be the first thing you should be doing before anything else. But then again, I'm not sure, because if you need something from your family, you'll do anything to help that family member.
703	You're not talking about your home life, but you must have a very good reason. If you could find work in a walking distance, I think it's reasonable. I was subjected to a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave my house, and I still recommend that you stay at home as long as you can.
704	Since he knew about it, hadn't filed a petition at the time, let a lot of time pass, the court would have interpreted it as permissible. But he would have to file a petition for contempt of court and order her back into the state, much better if she had done it before she left, or as soon as she did.
705	The question is: "Freedom of speech is both ways" People don't only have the right to say whatever they want, but other people have the right to object, argue, and even ask for an apology. A liberal says something, a conservative objected, and the liberal is criticized for "violating a person's freedom of speech." A conservative says something, a conservative objected, and the liberal is criticized for "letting it go" or "defending the original statement on its merit. So who's really against freedom of speech? The conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't supposed to say that they are offended by a statement?
706	Americans, I believe, don't think this way, but there's a lot of debate about this issue. Currently, abortion is legal in most states, but conservative religious zealots are always trying to change the law. Of course, I'm pro-choice and pro-life, but I think that since it's a woman's responsibility, it must ultimately be her choice.
707	It is simply the best way of doing things. Ask any country that has used it and you will find that their crime rates are much lower than the USA's. This is only true if the nation is comfortable with it. On the other hand, it is immoral to take another's life regardless of the circumstances, since you assume superiority when doing so and all people are equal. There are many other ways of doing things and capital punishment should not be the first choice.
708	The dismissal of the lawsuit does, however, leave the possibility of a reappraisal of the case or of a further attempt at collection of the owed debt. "Without prjeudice", the court has not been adjudicated and no solution has been provided. However, you have grounds for a counter-action if they continue to pursue the claim or make a bad statement to the credit reporting agencies. You can ask an attorney to assist in drafting a formal letter to the company advising them that you intend to take action. You should include copies of all the bad information on the credit reports and demand that they be corrected. Additionally, you should notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand that it be amended. This will ensure that you protect your interests and, if the company is foolish enough to try again, you have the opportunity of suing them in return.
709	To answer your question and to disprove the genius who compared capital punishment with abortion, the fact is, there's been a lot of cases where people were put to death, but later found innocent.
710	I think you should have a fence around any pool in Ohio. If you don't have a fence around your pool, and a child sneaks in and drowns, you'll be in full liability, and probably lose your house, car, and possibly your wages for years while you're trying to pay off the liability lawsuit. In my opinion, the risk isn't worth the reward, and I'd install it regardless of the law.
711	I've just come to know about discrimination at work, and I've been wondering what this is all about. It's funny, because the law says you can't discriminate on the basis of sex, color or age. But whites are the only group that isn't protected, so technically it's illegal to exclude them, but they aren't protected. It's a bit of a paradox, but how often do they need protection in America?
712	Technically IC Systems is responsible, but you'll probably have to go to a small claims court to get them to pay. My advice is that you change your bank account number immediately so they can't use it any more. (This is the only reliable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers after you've given your permission for withdrawal.) Then you should set up other payment arrangements. Tell them you want to reduce the amount of your debt by the $120 fee they've charged you, and then write a letter to them, then pay the account down to the point where you have only $120 left. Then stop paying. If they keep coming after you, you should refer to the letter and say you have a legitimate dispute.
713	We already have it, it's called a Social Security Card. Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information on a given Social Security Number. But our government has made it so difficult that most employers won't bother. When you are hired for a job, you need to present I-9 documentation. You can use passports, state issued IDs and Social Security Cards (not just numbers), birth certificates and birth certificates, etc. The problem is that our elected officials are becoming better and better at creating useless laws that do nothing but waste our money and time. Politicians are becoming better and better at creating useless laws that keep us from doing anything but creating unnecessary wastes. And we keep re-electing them. So I would not vote for this ridiculous restriction on my freedom and waste of American taxpayer money.
714	I'm not following this case, but I think any law named after a person is questionable, because people reacting to it often with emotion and grief rather than rationality.
715	I don't agree with everyone else's views, but I will fight to the death for them to be able to say what they feel.
716	Iraq doesn't deserve our freedom, but we must continue fighting terrorists for the world. We are not dictators, we are fighters for freedom, justice and liberty. Unfortunately, we lost sight of this and voted wrong yesterday. We are headed in the wrong direction.
717	Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong, but it is dangerous to break laws that are not severe. For instance, speeding, not wearing seatbelts, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.,
718	I agree with you, my animals suffer every year, they seem to be going off weeks before now, the first big display I've seen was a couple of weeks ago, in the middle of October, what happened on November 5th? If it was just one night, it wouldn't have been so bad. I can't take my pets to sleep because it's been going on for weeks, they're scared. Even though fireworks are illegal for children, they still buy them, just like cigarettes and alcohol. They're dangerous and just another tool for those who want to menace the public. They should be banned from being sold in shops. Organized displays should be for one night only, so that we can help our animals with sedatives.
719	Thanks for mentioning this important issue. Most of the things you mentioned are useful, but the danger is if they are misused. The Bush administration has shown us how rights can be violated by holding prisoners in Cuba for the rest of their lives without charges or legal assistance. The only way to protect our rights is to participate in the legislative process. I hope everyone who reads this will be prepared to vote for liberty on July 7.
720	If half the schools in the U.S. agree, then the teachers aren't doing their job in the history section of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights and the rights of others. At least I'd expect the Civil War to be mentioned in the sixth grade, and the rest would follow. Freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.,
721	If we're talking about ethics, you should be informed about the medication the child is taking. Legally, if the juvenile center is treating your child with any kind of illness, they don't have to inform you if he is older than 12. I also think that since the child is a ward of the state because of his or her confinement, the state doesn't have to inform you about any new charges or pending charges.
722	I've never worked as a server or a waiter, but I think they should all be paid minimum wage regardless of how much tips they get.
723	I agree. If a person wishes to make the Pledge before a meeting, class, etc., he should be allowed to do so. No one is forcing others to do so, and they are perfectly free to refuse. It really pisses me off when people try to say that the Pledge violates their rights. But then again, what about my right to assert myself and my loyalty to my country? It would be above all else.
724	Firstly, because it's essentially a price for human life and dignity. You can give it, you shouldn't sell it.
725	I don't think so, and I'm sure he's not the first student to think about this.
726	If the daughter was 19, and competent at the time, all records were hers, no one else's. If years passed and the daughter hadn't made any attempts to get the documents, then the records would be presumed to be theirs. You need a lawyer.
727	It has been proved to the satisfaction of many people, but some people, especially those who trust the government, do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of their own citizens.
728	In short, polls will never be 100% helpful unless they are designed, carried out and conducted with practically no human intervention at all. But what's the fun of that?
729	When I'm a good father, and I believe I am, my children's lives will be better off because of the values I've taught them and the examples I've given. And I'm sure that, through the various mentoring programs, I've made a difference in the lives of those people, and I'm sure they'll be better off knowing me than they would otherwise have been.
730	Yes, it's biased, but what do you expect from a company that readily hands over personal Internet subject search records of Americans to Bush and Co. for the purpose of cracking down on porn? And it was a mistake to ask that question. It's a crime to threaten the president, and even though you weren't trying to do it, it could be interpreted that way, especially by this president. But I noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slip through, which isn't acceptable to them, but I guess, as long as you're not offensive in a political sense, you're fine with it.
731	Is it true that rich people pay taxes to other people, but it's the middle class that gets the short end of it?
732	To answer your previous question, the President can name anyone, not just foreigners, a "person who might be helping terrorists" and keep them indefinitely in an undisclosed place. This effectively negates habeas corpus, because the President does not have to explain to a court why he believes that a person has aided terrorists, so he can literally pick anyone and no one, not even the Supreme Court, will force him to produce that person again.
733	You mean "employee" or "unfair dismissal"? In most states, an employee can be dismissed for any reason or no reason. But you cannot be fired because you are a protected class, such as age, race, sex, or handicap. You can't be fired because you are not a member of a protected class. Seek legal advice from a lawyer who specializes in employment law.
734	I heard that there's a much higher rate of identity stealing in Australia and the U.S., because they're just stealing your identity out of a card, rather than going through a lot of bills and stuff like that, and they're not going to be able to get all your information. I think this is a stupid idea, and you're going to need an ID card to prove who you are, and you're going to need a passport, a driver's licence or some other thing that you don't have, and then you're going to need to prove who you are, and you're going to need a driver's licence or something like that, and you're not going to be able to get your money back. And then again, if they introduce them and someone steals someone's identity and steals all their money, they're going to find out how stupid it is.
735	I'm very fond of your starting point, "All Rise!" And I'm not a believer in "God", and that's because he's never spoken to anyone but the leaders, which makes me suspicious that the leaders are telling lies, and that's what makes me suspicious.
736	I'm a bigot, I'm against all forms of Marxism, and I think that man should judge himself by who he isn't. I think public education is a waste of money, because there's no way to know what kind of person he is, and that's why we haven't seen a war yet.
737	I agree, unless it's a medical condition, etc., but otherwise, yes. Show respect to our country. Our brave soldiers are willing to fight for America and risk their lives. Some people here are too lazy to take the risk and swear loyalty to our flag. I don't think that's right. I'll proudly stand by my country and do everything I can to support it.
738	He still has the right of a lawyer, but if you can't bail out or get a bondman, then he probably won't be able to face the courtroom until he's ready to face the judge. If he doesn't like it, then maybe he won't make the same mistake again when choosing a girl.
739	I don't discriminate against homosexuals, but the fundamentals of gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that homosexuality is not a choice.
740	Although mergers between large companies are carefully evaluated before they are given the green light, so that they do not distort competition by creating one giant company with too much power, the acquisition of smaller companies by big companies is not considered to be problematic, even if the value of the smaller company is high. For instance, Facebook acquired Whatsapp, which is Facebook's main business model and it has a huge amount of personal data. Moreover, I feel that Facebook has violated my rights when it gained the right to do whatever it wants with my data without my consent and without the possibility of removing it or destroying it. It is not only because I have faith in the company A that I have given my data to company A that I have no confidence in company B, the buyer.
741	I'm aware that they're brave, but in my community they think it's more noble to be in the military after high school than to go to college, when in fact most people who go to my school don't go to college.
742	I've got AK-47s and.40 caliber Springfield Armory handguns with 10 round magazines, and I think that if someone wanted to kill as many people as he could with an AK-47, they would have been more dangerous than that.
743	I don't want to argue whether road killing is bad or good for the environment, but rather my emotional reaction to seeing an animal die senselessly.
744	Paper checks used to be a practical and simple way to transfer money from a checking account to another account, but now that technology has advanced, it is no longer necessary. Direct deposit paper checks are used by older people who do not have problems with them and have no need to change, even though they are inconvenienced for those waiting in line behind them.
745	The recession hit the hardest, many men remain unemployed, and many go to college at lower rates than ever. Meanwhile, many women are being encouraged to enter fields that men are not, and there are many secure jobs that are 90% female, both in the field and in the college. Given the higher number of males unemployment, I think that anyone offering a female-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be obliged to promote a male-specific scholarship in a field where women are dominated.
746	I don't know how anyone can spend hours sitting in a stadium watching cars go round and round in circles, and how entertaining that is.
747	Essentially, the issue is about whether the two countries lost territory that was rightfully in the hands of their people.
748	I don't like the death penalty, in general, because I don't think it's effective as a deterrent; people who do foolish things aren't wise enough to think about the consequences. But corporate leaders probably are. They'll be thinking twice before sinking an airplane and rescuing Lady Liberty from a golden parachute, because they'll be landing on Lady Liberty's sword.
749	There are hundreds of states on this planet, and all of them are involved in initiating aggression against the people they control. Sometimes, for example, a criminal is justified by the fact that he is being held. But the state is often the initiator of the aggression, and that is usually justified by the fact that it is being committed by the state.
750	I'm not sure what's wrong with the title, but I think a good government is a good thing, society's consciousness when it's right, and taxes are the natural cost of having a good government.
751	It's very easy. Men who are very rich and famous, even if they are younger and decent looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They don't even need any game to have sex. It's too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this.
752	Basically, I'm saying that since the storm-cloaks are depicted as the complete villains from the two choices, that they are the weaker part of the Skyrim story.
753	I think the word they're looking for is Hip Hop/youth culture that isn't just about black people. There are many parts of this culture that are bad for society, like sexism, homophobicity, and racism. And there are also some parts that aren't very good, like disrespect and rudeness. Watch the hundreds of videos of people destroying other people's property for laughs, or even the ones with the glorification of the ones who do drugs, it's disgusting.
754	Christian A does not deserve to be taken seriously, he can still have his beliefs without denying what is scientifically proven, but he chooses ignorance.
755	I used to belong to the /r/NoFap community and I was proud when I had a day where I didn't masturbate. But I never went over 2 weeks without masturbation. And I felt dread and depression knowing that I would just masturbate again someday. Today I broke my 4 day streak and I'm feeling depressed and stressed.
756	We're all capable of the horrible things that Hitler did, and the right circumstances and societal influences might have made it so.
757	The artist's ability to match something in our bodies that causes us to feel emotions is the basis for all that we consider art. Among those things that we consider beautiful outside the realm of art, such as fractals, algorithms, arguments, are things with inherent patterns or that describe something elegantly.
758	It is not possible to determine whether one sex is more intelligent than another, but it will all depend on the individual.
759	But the fact that the US still ranks as the world's innovator, while China, India and even much of Europe can only reproduce our inventions, follow our research and imitate our military strength is of no doubt a reason for our social problems.
760	You see, we have the remains of our ancestors, we shiver, we have bipeds, our hair grows at the end when we are scared, and we all have tail bones. I am not an atheist, I believe in God, I just know that God planned everything from the creation of the universe, knowing what would happen, including that what was created would evolve and evolve, and that life would continue to evolve, and that God planned it all. There is no conflict between my faith and evolution, and the increasing number of progressive Christians of various denominations.
761	Oil has long outlived its use, and there is plenty of plastic that can be recycled. All plastic is recyclable.
762	I'd be in favor of that, because animals are supposed to be free, and that's not something that would ever be taken seriously by a large number of people, because they view animals as inferior, which would justify their confinement.
763	I don't think it's necessary to have privacy on the Internet, but if you have nothing to hide, or don't know what you're doing, you don't need to keep your identity concealed.
764	As it stands, pride has a lot more talent than ufc, and it's not about the U.S. versus the world, it's about having a wider range of talent to choose from.
765	Don't tell me all about "They changed the way we make music" or "They're so profound" when I listen to rock music.
766	Human beings cannot survive without the help of machines, as can be seen in the hospitals where respirators, kidney dialysis machines, defibrillators are used to save people in danger of death. Moreover, mobile phones, cars, mp3 players, the notorious PSP, which we see thousands of children, teenagers and adults playing, also demonstrate the immense dependency of mankind on machines.
767	I don't know how I'd make a living, but what right do I have to judge what someone else is doing with their lives? I've had trouble keeping myself on track when I was younger, but life changes as you get older and older. I'm responsible for myself and I'm going to have to explain what I did or didn't do.
768	I'd argue that people are basically good, but not necessarily all good. We have all had bad eggs, but that doesn't make us essentially evil or selfish. We can easily be fooled, but not fundamentally evil.
769	I'm going to assume Senator McCain is sincere and wants to participate in the bailout of the economic crisis if he's going to be the big cheese after the November election. But I'm not going to let him down on that either. What's stopping him from giving up just a couple of hours on one evening to participate in a debate that is very important for his chances in the coming election? Because I think McCain is scared, and that shows that he's going to be frightened when it comes to the crunch.
770	Yes, there are several instances where "no" is the correct answer, but in both forms, people vote for the person they wish to rule, they choose those who agree with them. In the United States, for instance, they elect one president, but that is still the way people choose.
771	Why do we have the right to live, liberty and pursue happiness? If marriage is one of the milestones in that quest, then perhaps we won't be very happy.
772	Although it's not technically correct (web 2.0 isn't a new WWW version), mass adoption of a technology requires two things: 1) a technology that works and 2) a hook that the public and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will understand, mass marketers will be able to use it, etc., etc. I know it's a ludicrous argument, and it'll irritate many people, including myself, if it happens, but it's a name that does better than the Semantic Web. SW isn't the kind of name you'd find on cereal boxes.
773	I'm playing guitar and I'm sure I can express myself. And I love Guitar Hero!
774	In a traditional society, which is still dominated by men, the general consensus of men is more popular than the general consensus of women, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be sexy because there is no male in the picture. (On the flip side, homosexuals are more popular because they have no honor.) In addition, homosexuals are discriminated against because they have no honor because romantic interest in men is only for women, and when they participate in a game, they are "lowering themselves" to a woman's level. (On the flip side, homosexuals are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, which gives them honor.)
775	Victor Frankl was a psychiatrist and prisoner during World War II, he said that in such a terrible condition he felt free because he could choose whether to be insane or calm, not only did he feel free, but he was free because freedom is choice and freedom is the capacity to do whatever one wishes.
776	GOW was just hyped and didn't have the same replay value as GRAW, so I think it's the wrong game to play with the 360.
777	I ordered a grilled veggie burrito with a lot of hot sauce, but it didn't help much and the filling was very bland. It was definitely cheaper than the other burrito places, but I would rather pay more for a good burrito!
778	We've been here a lot with my wife and I, and they just changed the nachos from a wonderful taste to something that's not very good. I hope they don't change it again.
779	My husband, who's a bit stingy with his stars, had been to a lot of NY deli meats, and I was a bit afraid of bringing him here, because I thought their smoked meat was simply the best. He tried it and loved it. And we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time we took it out.
780	I was looking for a teahouse in Madison and found this place. It was very warm inside and I didn't think it was a place I could do much work. The tapioca pearls were great and fresh, but the mango fruit tea was just too sweet and there wasn't any ice in it. The tea was much better when I added ice. The kid who helped me wasn't very enthusiastic about being there or very helpful for a first timer like myself.
781	I ordered a holy smokes burger with fries and a can of Pepsi and it was almost $20. The burger was good and the fries were pretty big, so I'm not complaining about that. I've had burgers in restaurants that were cheaper.
782	K O'Donnells is the place to be for food, they have everything you need and they have an award winning dog park where my dog is often spotted socialising with other dogs.
783	I'm a frequent customer here and it's very close to my house. It's near the Happy Valley roundabout which can be very busy when everyone finishes their work so we like to go early or a bit later to avoid the rush. It's also busy, so the line gets lunch, especially at lunch time, but it's usually pretty quick. The manager Thomas is very nice and very friendly. He recognizes my fiancé and I as frequent customers and always asks us about our day. I switch off from the burrito and bowl. With my burrito I ask them to mix it up and it's so delicious. I also get half chicken and half steak, so I get the best of both worlds for one price. I love having a healthy quick option to eat lunch or dinner. I would definitely recommend this place to others.
784	We came to this buffet after a casino show, the servers were not very friendly, but the restaurant was busy, so we assumed it was due to that. The buffet and restaurant were very nice and clean, but the food was not as good as I had expected. We will try another buffet next time we visit Vegas.
785	'Cause your clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you're allowed to dress however you like, it's coolio hoolio.
786	It's a good browser, but it's also a bit slow sometimes, so you can use the Internet even faster with a cache.
787	I'm using Linux, and thanks to the gods, there's no IE version for Linux yet. Firefox is open, you're free to do anything and nobody's going to be able to complain.
788	Who's the one who said that FF/Mozilla is related to Steve Jobs and Apple? It's not related at all. By the way, IE is terrible at creating pages and trying to make them look nice, FF adheres much closer to World Wide Web Consortium standards than IE has ever done or will.
789	If my wife had confided in me, I would not have betrayed her trust. She had believed in me to support and assist her, and I would have. I would have been angry and perhaps even divorced, depending on the kind of murder, whether it was self defense or she had thought it would have been amusing.
790	India, because there is too much disparity between rich and poor, and they still trust the caste system, will not be the world leader.
791	It doesn't even make sense. We all started together and that's how it should end. Everyone has their way. It's not even logical.
792	syona, if you look at it from a distance, most of us are unable to identify a solid solution that can remove the impediment to our progress from the root. We are all very well aware of problems, but unable to offer solutions. They criticize government, terrorism, corrupt politicians, etc., and they do not realize that being citizens is our duty. They criticize each other, because all of them are human, and they should understand their importance and role in society. Because all of them are human, and they are human, and they are human, and why do they create problems for other people. I hope you will understand my views and respond to me soon.
793	I'd rather not have a bad father than a bad father. I'd like a good role model to look up to and speak to, not someone who never existed.
794	Being fatherless would have ensured that his absence would be the only pain you'd feel, and that you'd never know what he was like.
795	We say Obama is the "founder" of health reform WHY because he is at such a high position and he is capable of doing something like investing money, time and effort into a project.
796	Somebody says that Raffles left Singapore a couple of years ago and left Farquer in charge, so he didn't bother with us. Imagine what it would have been like if SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU had done so much for us and were considered to be our founders now that they are back taking care of their schools. Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng had a day off for family time, would you say he wasn't our prime minister anymore? Would you say he neglected Singapore? He has a life!
797	I don't think porn is right unless it's got some smokey hot lesbians. Actually, I'm downloading porn right now as I type.
798	Pornography is wrong, if people watch it, we'll want to have free sex, and it will bring diseases, especially HIV, into the world.
799	It depends on your beliefs, because I am a Christian, I believe it is true, but it may be completely okay for someone else who is not a Christian.
800	It shouldn't be about how we got here, it should be about why we're here.
801	If the evealution's real, find me someone/someone halfway through
802	Hey, nobrob wasn't invented before Firefox, oh, that's bad!
803	Personally, I'm convinced Google Chrome is a shit, but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
804	Most Indian Government sites are built for IE, so it's important to have IE on your machine
805	Physical Education teaches children that it doesn't matter if they're nerds or jocks, because if they're all doing the same thing, they're all the same in the sense that they only pass the class if they make an effort, and sometimes they're just a jock from outside.
806	The answer is so clear: teachers should let everyone exercise so that they can strengthen their mussels and become thinner and more flexible rather than get fatter and more incompetent, so they won't be bullied as much.
807	Physical education should be compulsory, because so far in 2011 112,000 people have died due to lack of exercise and people are becoming overweight.
808	In order to solve the problem of obesity, I believe that PE classes should be compulsory at school.
809	Because when school ends, a lot of students play computer games, and then they can't get good health, and also get serious diseases like cancer, because of electromagnetic fields.
810	Because real PE classes provide people with opportunities to understand what they are capable of, and thus their self-esteem will increase, and they will be more productive within their societies.
811	I do not think it is unjust that Raffles discarded Farquhar in Singapore, accusing him of being too close to the local population.
812	It is not a matter of misuse of the right to abortion, but I believe that the individual should be given the option of deciding what he will do with his body.
813	It's the woman's choice, you can't control her. (However, how do you know she wouldn't kill herself in an attempt to kill her child?)
814	If a woman is unable to support a child emotionally, physically or financially, she should have the right to choose to give up her child.
815	It's really up to the situation; if a girl is raped, it's not right to keep the baby. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up having a baby, it's her fault that she wasn't prepared.
816	Women are human too, and it should be their choice what they bring into the world.
817	It's simple, how would we adapt to different environments, gradually changing to what is most comfortable for us, otherwise why aren't we all the same skin color? Why are there so many different species of animals?
818	I'm a big fan of porn, jerking is always enjoyable.
819	Yes, pornography degrades women, but if it's already happened, why don't we watch it?
820	Everyone has a goal and aims in life, but a person who helps the community and takes care of others will definitely live a better life.
821	I'm in the middle, because I always thought it was a good thing to help people, and it was a way to get blessings, but sometimes you need to help yourself to succeed, and you need to survive and provide for yourself.
822	Personally, I think that pursuing one's own interests is the most important thing in life, and if I focus on myself rather than the world, then one day, I might be able to help the people I care about most, and in return, I might be able to help myself even more.
823	Frankly, if children didn't dress like prostitutes all the time, it wouldn't have been a problem, but since they're all over school districts have to resort to this. The argument about individuality isn't worth anything, and it's not the job of schools to ensure that every child has the opportunity to express his or her opinion.
824	It's a great idea, I remember every morning I was wondering what to wear and it was a big problem, I spent quite a lot of time looking for the right clothes.
825	I agree. When I was studying at school, it wasn't a problem for me to choose clothes. At university, I spend too much time choosing clothes. First of all, it's wasting time. Second, if all students wear the same uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing students by social status.
826	I believe that uniform is essential in developing countries, especially in the case of students who do not have the same financial status.
827	Go to a school that allows it, but don't cry to me that your children aren't doing very well, easily distracted, and incapable of paying attention for five minutes in class. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but the point is that uniforms are here to prevent problems that would have arisen if they hadn't been wearing them.
828	I think it's a good idea to wear school uniforms, because it reminds children that they are equal at least in school, it also shows unity and makes children feel included, and it helps them to work together.
829	It's better to have a bad father than to be without a father, because you'll have someone to make mistakes with and motivate you to do better. You'll never think about what it would have been like if you had a father.
830	I'd rather have a bad father than not have a father at all. If you have a bad father, you have a father who cares and loves you. You can fix it if he's bad, you can talk to him and make sense of it.
831	I'd rather have a bad father than be fatherless, because all the bad guys out there are bad. I don't always agree with my dad, and sometimes when he comes home from work he just sits on the couch and watches TV and waits for my mom to cook him dinner. That's bad, but I love him and I don't know what I would do without him.
832	Don't worry, potato U isn't alone in drowning.
833	Bookz are a mess because it's harder to spell.
834	TV's better than books, 'cause you learn better by watching, not reading.
835	It's not a problem if two people want to live in sin together, but it shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I don't want them on a platform where they can spread their garbage and smear my kids. Since homosexuality is a learned sin, I don't want my kids to learn that it's okay.
836	I've already said my part in the debate, and we Indians have at least managed to understand this mongrel's language, and we're pretty good at it. But you English gimmicks, you've got a bad taste in your own tongue. I quote a sush102, "Hey, it's better dnt teach me what difference there is between talking and debate, if I start a debate and then you bloody will be forced to leave this site and run away. "What crap? "dnt," "ma," "dis," what kind of crap? "It doesn't matter what you say, but it still remains that Indians are the best.
837	India's economy is accelerating at a breakneck pace and may even reach double-digit growth by 2013, say Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Trade Minister Anand Sharma. Many economists agree that India's demographic dividend will see it maintain its high growth rate for a very long time.
838	India certainly has the potential to lead the world, perhaps because the USA, UK or some other country is stronger economically, but India is economically stronger and is the hub for many other companies.
839	India is one of the countries I've been looking out for the next 30 years, and I believe that by the end of this century they will be a good contender for superpower status.
840	Even if there was a legitimate proof that there was a god, there would be no valid proof that he was Christian or not.
841	It's your decision to spank kids, they can be bad, but do it as a last resort
842	I agree, but it must be used as a last source, not constantly and, of course, not too difficult.
843	I'll answer yes, because children are becoming more and more aggressive, and if they decide to act, they must be disciplined.
844	Yes, because if they're afraid of being spanked, they won't do it again.
845	Humans have been raised for thousands of years without much resentment for spanking, and today's kids are the most unruly. There is a trend. I admit that spanking is not the cause, but it is only a small part.
846	I'm a Christian, so I must support my religion and attend church.
847	I'm neither Christian nor Atheist, but I believe that Christianity is superior to Atheism. If you don't have a place for God in your life, you can't call it "life".
848	Yes, I'd be glad and relieved to have my wife accused of murder. Killing someone is the most serious crime in the world. I don't wanna be a part of a crazy woman who does murder. I wouldn't be comfortable with children or sleeping around her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years.
849	I'd agree, because being a murderer isn't the most pleasant life you could have had, knowing that every day you'd be so worried about the cops breaking in and taking you into custody for affiliating yourself with a crime scene or even your life in danger.
850	I'm going to have to say yes, she's killing somebody who could get you in trouble, even if you're an accomplice.
851	Whoever grants life, whoever grants death.
852	I'm pro-life because of one thing, abortion is being used like a last minute form of birth control. If you're not smart enough to use protection, you take the pill and give up your baby. There are thousands of people who can't have children who would love to have them.
853	What if we don't see the human form, but the embryo is growing and has the potential to grow one. About 60% of abortions are carried out by unmarried women. Why can't they give birth to a child instead, even if they are raped?
854	I'm defending the rights of a child who has the same right to life as his mother.
855	There are many students who do not like Physical Education, so it should be an elective subject.
856	It's not a commonly known fact, can you give me a reference? Or do you mean that homosexual _sex_ is helping to spread AIDS, in which case gay marriage might be helpful?
857	I've got so many gay friends, I'm in favor of this! People should stop being so against it. They can't help it. I've seen programs on this, and I've seen how gays feel when people look at them, some feel as if they're being watched. It's not right. We're all people.
858	I've got two best friends who are gay, one female and the other male, and I'm fine with them being around. They should all have the same right to marry someone they like.
859	It seems to me that pursuing one's own interests is more important than achieving the common good. If you can't improve yourself, you can't help others.
860	I don't think many countries consider men and women to be acceptable, it's almost always taboo in society. I don't think people will ever really accept a union under a god, but they should accept a legal union between two people who live together, because that's what they do. Ignorant people, however, seem to mix these two things. It's their business what happens under the sheets.
861	Yes, they have more power than they advertise. They passed things like the Patriot Act and the Terror Watch, which allows the government to spy on law-abiding citizens who are not allowed to do so under the Constitution. The Patriot Act allows the government to listen to telephones and check phone records of law-abiding citizens, and to search cars, homes and businesses without a warrant, which is also against the Constitution.
862	I'm a firefighter and paramedic and I'm always on Code 3 (lights and sirens), and the most dangerous part of my job is just getting into the emergency with all the traffic. You'd be surprised at the number of cars that don't pull over immediately. The idiots who don't pull over are usually on the phone, too busy with their surroundings, and hands free phones aren't very helpful.
863	I don't believe in ghosts, but when a friend of mine was missing for almost two years, she finally decided to use a psychic, and the family finally found her body.
864	You know, these people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you're worried, go back into the chat room and ask what they can do to keep you safe. I don't think the paedo will be able to trace you because of data protection. If you're still worried, talk to the cops and tell them what you're worried about.
865	The difficulty lies not in the specific question and the honest answer, but in the implications of the answer.
866	As far as I know, most countries where abortion is legal only allow it in the first trimester of pregnancy, where the fetus is not even properly referred to as a 'foetus' but rather a 'embryo', which is, in my opinion, a 'human being', which does not have any brain function and thus does not feel pain or recognize its existence (for anyone who wishes to know how to be certain, I can only say that I am not, I have only read it). The fetus is not a human being, but rather a 'embryo', which is not able to survive independently, and therefore is a crime. Please do not think that the fetus is a 'human being', but rather a 'embryo', which is a 'human being', which is a crime, and therefore is not a 'human being', but a 'embryo', which is a 'human being', which is a crime, and therefore is not a 'human being', but a 'embryo', which is a 'human being', which is a crime, and therefore is not a 'human being', but a 'embryo', which is a 'human being', which is a crime, and therefore is not a 'human being', but a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a 'embryo', which is a '
867	I've been in a position where I had to recruit a typing machine, and I had to explain to the HR department that perhaps this was a job that could be offered to a disabled person who might otherwise have difficulty finding employment, and I was astonished at the fact that they had no idea how to treat it.
868	They're allowed to shoot if they feel they're in danger of their lives, and I'm thinking this might be a bad thing for all the cops who are trying to do their job.
869	I assume you mean the entire criminal justice system, as in the Law and Order series, but it also involves the police and the judges. But the ones who make the laws are the ones who have the real power, and that's what gives them the money to buy influence and change laws. It's all back to the rich and powerful.
870	I doubt the police will do anything about it. But it would be costly and messy for both parties. You'd be better off letting it go, taking the high road and living your life honestly, knowing that these people are petty and unworthy of your attention. Light always shines through the darkness, and I'm sure the people who know you know.
871	We have sex offenders lists now, to protect the public from those who have been released from prison, but what sense does that make? We make lists because they are still dangerous, but why are they released if they are dangerous? I say, just kill them all.
872	The lawyers are swindlers, they're usually asking questions that they already know the answer to, and they're using different tactics to get you to talk what they want you to talk, unless of course, the lawyer is representing you or defending you. Some lawyers speak in very demanding voices, trying to weaken your confidence and challenge your statements. Be careful!
873	It's just liberal ignorance. Criminals will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat. It's just a "feel good" law. It makes them feel like they are doing something to fight crime while letting criminals run free. Statistics show that criminals do less when they face a well-armed citizen. And crime rates are falling.
874	It's a leftist thing to do, and I'm a guy who thinks that the reading of a legal book is as easy as reading a comic book.
875	It matters to those of us who went to school where all this was important, had or had parents who were important, and worked where it mattered. If you can get by without any of this, you might well conclude that it's all rather irrelevant and who can blame you?
876	You know, maybe your grandfather died for it, but people have the freedom to talk as they wish and write as they wish, if they don't like it, they don't have to be talked to or do business in a place that caters to Spanish speakers.
877	Unfortunately, oil is the ruler of all policies, but could I suggest a simple alternative that everyone can understand as sensible: use wind and wave energy to produce electricity, split water into its basic components, release oxygen into the atmosphere, burn hydrogen in our cars and produce water as a byproduct. You could do this in your backyard, and we would need only lubricants, which could probably be made from plants.
878	You should repay her, tell her that you can't afford a wedding gift other than repaying the debt, and then let it go.
879	It should be legal, prisons are overcrowded, they keep sending people there for possessing drugs, and they let other more violent criminals go. It doesn't make sense. And a lot of people learn how to commit worse crimes while they're in jail.
880	You're not going to get a warrant,I'm sure you've been issued one,but they don't have to tell you that it's been issued. You call the court and arrange payment. You have to pay the original fine, plus warrant fees, possibly interest, and whatever else the local laws allow them to add. Or you can ignore it and then when you're stopped for a simple traffic violation, they can arrest you for an outstanding warrant.
881	EDIT: Don't bash Clinton! He's eliminated the deficit, and we've had an surplus for a short time. We've survived and the economy's been fine. Bush has saddled us with this deficit. What's it going to be? Eight trillion plus? Who's paying for the war in Iraq? Who's paying for the rebuilding? Where's the Iraqi oil money? They're selling oil. Where's the money going?
882	I believe that no one is born a criminal, and the main reason that a person is born is that he was raised in a bad family and environment, and he can grow and mature well with the help of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
883	We have some good old boys here scratching each other's backs, making a living off us and turning it into a career. We need to pass term limits of no more than two years in both Houses and Senate. Get those 80-year old geysers out of there. They've already earned their pensions and benefits. Good people go into Washington with good intentions, but they can't do anything on their own.
884	I don't understand why you were fined for throwing a cigarette out of your window, unless your area is threatened with a forest fire, then I understand. Your best bet is to take it to court and try to refute the officer's testimony. Was it raining, foggy, parked on the side of the road behind some foliage, or were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out of the road? The main question you're asking is, "Can the officer reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?" If you think you can win the case, then you should. But if you think you can, then you must.
885	If you're driving, then yes, but in California you're responsible for the passengers in your car, whether or not they've got a seatbelt. If one of your passengers doesn't have a seatbelt, you can get a ticket, even if they're not adults. If you don't drive, then you're not responsible for them unless you and your parents sign something saying that you are.
886	All right, you've got to be careful how you play your game here, because if he can prove that your statements are false, he may be able to bring you into court for defamation. There are a couple of things you can do if he's wronged you: 1. sue him for the wrong he did to you. 2. Contact the Better Business Bureau in your area. 3. Report what he did to the government group that regulates the car dealers in your area. 4. Contact the TV station in your area that broadcasts complaints to customers.
887	You should seek legal advice if you are going to lose your job and perhaps your home due to lack of income. What are you losing? Your children could starve and your company will be heartbroken.
888	It's a shame to say, but there are some prisons where the gangs run them, and they don't care about the law.
889	I'm not sure how in the world he took the kids away from their mother, that's a very difficult thing to do in court, but I think if he wants his family back, and feels that if he doesn't have his family back, that there's no meaning in his life, then support her, but also remind him to be careful and try to save some money for himself in case. Maybe he really loves her and realizes that the grass isn't greener on the other side and now he wants his old happy life back, just help him secretly save some money for himself as a just in case fund. I wish your sister the best.
890	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to listen to private telephone conversations or e-mails or otherwise examine private communications of citizens of this country, whether citizens or non-citizens, they create a realm within the state which is exempt from the sovereignty of the people, and thus creates a realm within the statue, which is usually thought to be a distinguishing feature of dictatorships where secret services, torturers, etc. are also not answerable to the law or the people.
891	Why, a gay man here, can't get a job anywhere in the country, can't have a civil union with my 9 year old partner, no domestic partner rights, hell, if it were up to me, I'd be better off on some deserted island with such people, not free for me, but I'm still thankful to be an American and those who are fighting for what rights I have.
892	Well, the female body tells her when she's ready to have her period, but mature enough to do so is another matter.
893	Yes, you can be emancipated if you're not pregnant, but it's certainly a clear reason for the judge to approve the request. I did it. It took me about 30 minutes to fill out the forms, sign them, and five minutes to appear in front of the judge. It was pretty simple. And I'd recommend it, if you need to sign things on behalf of your baby. Most people won't question you, but it's good to have in your back pocket in case.
894	I don't think it's right that people are condemned to death for just a little injection of lethal dose, and then we get to pay for it with our tax dollars. The family and friends who committed the crime are usually tortured and suffer the rest of their lives.
895	What does this mean? Companies can advertise their products as superior to competitors' products, and they are even permitted to use images of competitors' products in their advertising. This encourages competition, and as long as they are not deliberately trying to fool people, fair use protects their use of trademarks and copyright.
896	I think that if the pain, suffering and lack of hope are unbearable, then everyone should have the right to end his or her life, either by himself or by asking someone else to do it. For instance, my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I find ridiculous for obvious reasons. And if a person isn't capable of doing it on his own, then he or she should ask someone else to do it, either by means of "direct" methods such as a painless poisoning or by "indirect" methods such as shutting off the machine that keeps the body pulsing, either by means of "indirect" methods such as shutting off the machine that keeps the body pulsing, or by means of "indirect" methods such as shutting off the machine that keeps the body pulsing. Please keep in mind that I am talking about VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA, not non-voluntary euthanasia or involuntary euthanasia.
897	In fact, the brain is made up of different parts and therefore responds differently to the same stimuli. But given the exact same situation, the brain responds exactly the same to the same stimuli every time. In fact, you never have a choice.
898	Dishwashers are not only expensive, but they do not work well, and you have to take the dishes out of the dishwasher when they are still dirty, and you have to clean them manually.
899	It is not different from assuming that all African Americans grow up in poverty and join gangs, and are lucky enough to graduate from high school. It is also wrong to presume that all whites have a better life than minorities.
900	The invasion of Gaza is also unjustified and impractical. It is similar to Iraq, where you cannot stop the terror by entering and destroying the lives of the people. The palestinian people are already against Israel and terrorizing Gaza only radicalises them and makes them into hamas militants. Besides, Israel has shown blatant disregard for the lives of civilians, 50 Israelis died against 1500 palestinian. This is not about hamas versus israel, it is about the people of Gaza who are being sucked into it.
901	I've got plenty of other arguments, but I'm going to wait until the debate starts.
902	The argument is false because soda existed long before the current obesity epidemic, and soda has gradually become more expensive over the years and consumption has not dropped enough to prove that price is a significant factor. The comparison with cigarettes and tobacco is false, because soda is not an addictive substance and does not cause any harm to the human body, but in comparison with cigarettes and tobacco which can cause a lot of harm.
903	I'm sure I'll change my mind, but I'm not sure why anyone liked this movie. I understand taste is subjective, but it's hard for me to imagine that anyone else found it entertaining or artistically significant. Also, please don't use the sequels to defend the quality of the first movie. I want to know why the first movie was so highly acclaimed even before the sequels were released.
904	I think that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. Obviously, there should be similar laws to alcohol, where you can't drink in public.
905	*EDIT* Without an industrial system to manufacture the insulin they need, all 3 million people would have died within days or weeks without any treatment.
906	As a kid in high school last year, I saw many kids who had lunches that consisted of chips, candy, and soda and refused to buy lunch either because they didn't want to spend the money, or because the food was poor quality.
907	Prostitution is between two consenting adults. If a prostitute needs money, it is her choice how she earns and uses her body. If people associate prostitution with violence and crime, it would be safer if it were legal, regulated and taxed.
908	I understand that people who post questions or images that have already been posted are disliked, but it's a good thing to do. For example, I'm a big fan of /r/askhistorians, but I have never asked a question there. I rely on others to think of interesting questions that I wouldn't have thought of, and then read the answers. This is also true for many other subs. As there is no easy way to view historical posts unless they are published, and unless they are reposted, there is no way for others who haven't seen them the first time to see them again.
909	It is illegal to call a towing company to remove a car from its premises, but only if the police are involved as they would be if a trespasser were to be removed. Then the towing company should be allowed to move the car to the nearest available public road or area and then it should be remanded to a *police* impound lot.
910	I've read some racist writing, and I don't think that there is a scientific basis for many of its claims. Why don't we study the differences in races, skin colours, etc.? I don't want to do that, though, because it could be misinterpreted by hateful people and cause a resurgence of racial discrimination.
911	_____ While the relic is interesting, it has little historical significance. Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It rightfully belongs to the men who found him and it is their right to do whatever they choose. Shortly after recovering the Cross, Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan. He thanks Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection. So we know Dr. Jones doesn't feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing. Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum. CMV.
912	Suppose our species is extinct, what better tool could aliens use to understand humanity better? Wikipedia isn't 100% reliable, but it provides a general explanation for almost all human history. There's no other source that has ever offered more information on us than Wikipedia.
913	I'm not sure we should spend millions on research on animal combinations that look like octopi, their faces are similar to octopi, their legs and arms are wavy, and their heads are chicken heads. I don't think we should be smothering them with the idea that we are creating abominations.
914	I'm a professional software engineer working for some big software companies. Software should never be patented, just copyrighted. The software algorithms are not very obvious. The shopping cart, the sorting of cards are very simple. The software algorithms for more complex stuff are also very simple. The JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression.
915	I don't create this topic, by the way, but people who are free from their will and desires are evil, myopic, primitive, prone to vice, and cannot be trusted and must be obeyed.
916	I think black people give a bad name, because you barely see whites on TV when something bad happens. You mostly see rappers who are black go to jail for some stupid stuff, and you never see any country singers who are white go anywhere bad, but it's mostly black people.
917	I think we're overrated when it comes to smoking prohibition in public places, why can't it be just a matter of decency if a smoker is among nonsmokers, if he has to smoke, if he has to, he can smoke a cigarette in the toilet, or something like that. I think we'll have no problem if we take a little time to think about manners.
918	I would have mocked the Americans if they had let celebrities influence their vote without checking the facts themselves, but now I must admit that there is little chance that the facts would have been available to them through the regional news agencies, so this might have been a good idea B. Do what you were told by America, but by someone slightly more intelligent than the current President. Apathy has worked well so far, and TV has given you the best burgers, so I think they know which president is the best.
919	I don't think it's a waste of time, but it's a waste of time because our world (Earth) has bigger problems than we do, like poverty, population, pollution, and the biggest threat...Global warming. Which will kill 6.5 billion or maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could focus on our world problems first and try to solve them instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and soon find out it's impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientists caring too much about other things when their lives might also be at stake.
920	Filtered, no. Standardized, yes. Domain extensions that are specific to "unsavory" sectors should be available. For instance, pornography sites should all be required to use a.xxx extension so that the router can block all incoming connections to that site. This way, parents can block a whole group of sites by blocking domain extensions.
921	It's simple, classical music is stagnant, most classical music lovers are snobbish, they want to know exactly how it was done centuries ago. They put down so-called "neo-classical" Jazz is always evolving, it's a living art form, it's always adapting the latest music trends, but it's still jazz. Oh yes sire they are purists, but they're a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians don't play the same song the same way twice, it's different and fresh every time they play it. Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the United States of America, made up of African, European and homegrown elements. Jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity. Jazz is America's biggest cultural export.
922	The ruling was a referendum on the insubordination of Bush and his administration to the obligation to protect the Constitution.
923	Yes, it's not so hard, my grandmother was married for about 50 years, and it ended when she died.
924	Test cricket is dying out, let's get rid of games that last three days and don't always have a winner.
925	Every religion is spreading its count, it doesn't matter if they believe from the heart. Maybe that's why most terrorists become Christians, maybe that's why poor people become Christians, and they're shown the bait of money. So, what matters is whether or not they believe from the heart.
926	Termaionater, 'cause he's made of metal, and he said in the movie that he could live for a million years, and he can see everything when it's dark. And he's a lot smarter than Rob Cop. Rob Cop is just a human and metal, see, if he shouts in the mouth he'll die. And he'll die quicker every time he gets hit really badly. But that's why he's so much better than Rob Cop. 'Cause he's not gonna die if he shouts, he loses his arm, and he can still walk really fast.
927	It is time for the United States government to realize that it is possible to negotiate and conduct active diplomacy with enemy governments or countries or political parties they consider terrorists. This is the time when John McCain is comparing all attempts at dialogue with Hamas, Iran or other terrorist groups with "foolish delusion" and compares diplomacy with "the false comfort of appeasement" of the Nazis.
928	How's that going to be enforced? Stopping people on the road, asking for their drivers' licenses and registration, and conducting a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for a breath test, please exit the vehicle." Will that make it easier for the cops to stop people who are under the influence of alcohol?
929	...and I've heard that the "Network" movie from 1976, and it can be seen as proof that today the news isn't about the TV ratings, but about the ridiculous tactics used by them.
930	I think doodling should be compulsory in foreign language and science classes, I've retained more in both because we had assignments involving drawing and comics. Doodling has helped me concentrate better on what my teachers are saying, simple squiggly lines are the best. Though I must admit that when I start to "doodle" my doodles tend to turn into full-blown drawings, shade and color mixed in, which makes me lose focus. I should probably figure out how to keep my attention away from visual appeal and just drawing and doodleing.
931	I'm going to talk about machines, 'cause they don't matter which machines we're talking about, terminators, or "i robots," they're not easy to kill. Zombies, one shot at the head or destroying the head, and that's it. And machines can control other machines, like cars, supercomputers, cell phones, a whole city's power supply, and military weapons like jets, tanks, and so on, and once they get their weapons, we'll have a huge war on our hands.
932	Indeed, it should be as rare as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation. It should not be part of our being. We are the product of millions of years of evolution into a world where chance is the only thing that can evolve.
933	It had a good plot, a typical revenge story, but it wasn't revealed until the end. It had a good twist, and a moral at the heart of it.
934	We've been here on Friday and the food's been great. I really liked the F'n Loaded Sliders, filet mignon mixed with blue cheese and a bottomless basket of garlic fries. It was so good and the prices weren't what you'd expect for such a good meal. You're getting P.F Chang's but without the cost and in my opinion, better food.
935	I haven't been to a Sizzler in a while, but the food and service are pretty good. The salad bar is pretty full, and they have four soups, and the chicken rice gone wild was the best of them all. The French onion was good, too. And the salads were full of vegetables, and you could always ask for more. The food is good value for the price.
936	I love that you can order half orders of appetizers, which is perfect for those who want light or variety. My wife and I usually take our dog to the patio overlooking Uptown, and split half an order of cheesy crab dip with pita, and half an order of chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is amazing, and you won't be disappointed.
937	The front desk was a joke. I was waiting for about half an hour for a towel and then I gave up. I will stay again if I have no other choice but make sure I have everything I need before leaving the front desk, as you cannot contact them after you check in.
938	I'm not interested in Tiesto or Calvin Harris playing here, it's a joke. Security guards should protect their guests, not make it more difficult or hurt them. My fiancé's arm is bruised and swollen for several days. It's a way to force a 300lb security guard to shove a woman of 120lbs into the ground, hoping your ego is soaring. And we haven't had a drink yet.
939	We had the worst service ever, the food took a long time to come out, and our server forgot to order food for the kids, so they just ate our French fries. We decided that we would just skip the extra wait and go somewhere else for dinner.
940	We've been to Carpe Diem a couple of times before their move to Elizabeth, and tonight we tried it again for our anniversary dinner. Big mistake. The food was terrible. Over-seasoned, overdone, steak overcooked, quail in a bed of black rice and syrupy sweet sauce. The wine was overpriced, the salad was uninteresting and the dressing was boring. The meatballs were overcooked and the sauce was not very good.
941	I would have given this a lower rating had the food not been so expensive and boring. The sliders I received were not cooked all the way through and the buns were greasy. However, I would have ordered fries and sat at the bar, as the service was excellent, but I would not order sliders again.
942	I'd agree, even in private schools, and even in those schools, because it's a voluntary association. You know, I think school uniforms restrict freedom of speech and limit youth's individuality.
943	Bad, I'm too busy explaining why, so take my word for it. I used to wear it at school for 4 years.
944	Sitting in a classroom for hours is uncomfortable.
945	I'm using Firefox now, and it's a lot easier to look at the Internet than using Internet Explorer.
946	It is only by proving that Internet Explorer users are cooler and more interested in having sex that they prove that FireFox is superior.
947	At least Firefox isn't a copycat like Internet Explorer 7, which copied Firefox to tabs.
948	It's even better than a prenup. Her: "I'll be leaving you and taking half your shit." Me: "Hope you like prison b*%h"
949	We're selfish, and we've been created a survival mechanism that says we do whatever it takes to protect the ones we love.
950	If my wife were to murder, I wouldn't have turned her in, because if you really loved her, you would have brought her back to me through anything good or bad.
951	I'm not sure I'd turn them in for love, but I wouldn't be staying with her, I'd be moving away from her, and that's all the reason I'd want to get involved in a crime that I've known about.
952	Ha, ha, no, India was the most successful when ruled by other empires, they could not even manage it.
953	No, the last time I checked, the rags were used to clean toilets, not headscarves.
954	They're going to be insulted and vilified, but I've written everything I know to be true.
955	I'd rather be a father less, it's not a bad thing to say, but I don't wanna think of my father as a bad man.
956	It's a challenge, but it gives them the freedom to be tough and dependent upon themselves.
957	I'm saying again, you need to be in a position to be a founder, because time, money, effort are all invested in it. You need to know people who can help you.
958	The Dutch were angry that the British would take Singapore, but Raffles stopped them from taking Singapore.
959	Is porn good for your health?No, opponents say that porn does not have serious effects on health, but studies have shown that porn and its practice can damage your health slowly, especially your immune system. Sooner or later, those who do porn in their relationships definitely do not have good health as others. This is the key question. Somke is bad for you. Smokers feel good when they smoke, but smoking 100% leads to their death and porn has the same influence on health. I think that smoking is better than porn in fact, both of them are extremely bad for you.
960	Firefox is so bloated now that it uses a lot of memory. When everyone buys a new PC and gets IE7, they'll have no excuse to switch to Firefox.
961	The tooltip for hovering over the tabs in IE7 displays the page title and address. Firefox 2.0 only displays the title, while Internet Explorer 7 displays the address.
962	It's much simpler to use, it's more visually appealing, and it's much safer.
963	People think that physical education is completely useless, because it's just a run around the playground for an hour. But there's something else going on here: muscle building, strength building, not fattening, and, in later life, preventing heart attacks.
964	It should be compulsory, because active and participation in sports, even in PE, contributes to the development of good habits for life, and it also benefits from working as a team, which is not always the case in other classes.
965	You're absolutely correct, I'm in Pe, they're forcing us to dress like idiots, I think, so they can see our private parts, and PE is just stupid.
966	William Farquhar had been dismissed because, despite his many good works during Singapore's development, he had taken measures in his administration which were against Raffles' instructions, so that many people had simply ignored Farquhar's contributions and credited them to Raffles.
967	When Farquar was fired from Raffles, he was given a larger funeral than Raffles, which showed how much the people loved him.
968	William Farquhar had been there to solve their problems when Raffles was not there, and he had even taken money from his pocket to solve some problems. SEP> When he was forced to leave, the people were sad, for he had been so far from home.
969	While I personally do not believe that abortion is right, I do not believe that the government has the right to decide.
970	Unfortunately, sabrejimmy's posts are not very intelligent, and I think I will have to ignore them in the future.
971	I call the gods that creationists believe in, "Gods of the Gaps." The early man had no idea that earthquakes were caused by the movement of the plates, so the idea that they were caused by an angry deity seemed logical, but now we know that the current species came into being through billions of years of evolution.
972	Evolution is happening, and it's documented and studied. I'd like you to consider this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and then you can give your opinion. Thank you.
973	It's not wrong to have porn, it's just an abstract noun that can't be wrong.
974	All humans have sexual desires, and sometimes they don't feel like having sex, and just want a simple release.
975	What's the point of the government being able to ban it, the porn? Why does Europe have such a good attitude towards everything?
976	In principle, pornography is not bad, sometimes very bad taste, but when it gives equal pleasure, etc., it isn't bad, and in some respects, it's an art form.
977	It's a lot better to advance the common good. We have been taught from the very beginning of our lives how to work together, and it's the whole point of community service to help one another.
978	As fashion and trends change, students are more interested in how they appear and how they are perceived than in their ability to study and achieve.
979	It's a good idea to wear school clothes, first of all, it makes students look nice and tidy, secondly, we can see who's studying at which school or who's studying at the same school as us, and thirdly, it's convenient, since we don't have to spend too much time choosing the right clothes for school.
980	It would be better if you had a bad father than no father. You'd have a sense of who he was and where he was. And you'd have a sense of what you would have been if you had a good father.
981	I'd rather have a bad father than none. I think it's better to have a father around than none. A father is a big part of a child's life, he keeps things stable during childhood.
982	Yes, I've got a water bottle next to me, no bidding!
983	Only in emergencies, whether natural or human, should we use bottled water, so that we do not pollute the environment and harm the habitats by dumping it in the sea or in the landfill. Plastic does not decompose, so do not use it in emergencies.
984	TV, 'cause you're able to get information from different sources in a short time, 'cause books, you have to read a lot for that amount of information!!
985	They can be recycled and turned into other things, like more water bottles, and they make the water companies rich. They don't cost much, like three bucks for a big pack at the Shaws, and you'll stay dry for a couple of weeks without thirst.
986	It would hurt the economy, because hundreds of people would lose their jobs and big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would lose millions of dollars.
987	God created water bottles for a reason, 'cause they're good.
988	Guys, without those plastic bottles, we could easily walk the block without fearing that we had a safe supply of water.
989	Homosexuality is wrong, and I like this website, but I don't think it's very clear.
990	Here's one reason why gay marriage isn't right. If it's right, why don't you marry your sister and brother? Oh, wait, it's the sex, so sister and brother or brother and brother are okay.
991	India has the potential to lead the world. Dr. Manmohan Singh is considered to be the finest Prime Minister in the world. India has demonstrated its potential in different fields and aspects.
992	I'd like to remind you that there aren't a lot of disputes on the Christian side, because people with free minds don't need to persuade others. We know that there's no gods and that our lives are all about us.
993	For reasons that should be very clear, and which I assume the others involved have thoroughly explained.
994	Yes, because it's not ABUSE to be spanked.
995	It should not be used frequently, but it should be used to transmit the message to the child.
996	I'm sorry to see our religion not recognized, but I'm sure Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism are amongst those that have to agree.
997	The parent should not use spanking as an option to discipline his child, because he may grow up traumatised and feel unloved because he will be spanked a lot, which will cause him to have low self-esteem. Moreover, spanking should not be an option, because the parent will be angry and unable to think rationally at the moment.
998	Children shouldn't be spanked because they should be treated equally.
999	I would not have been lenient to any murderer in my midst, if the murder had been committed without pleasure or malice, so that the penalty would not have been so severe, but nevertheless, all murderers must be tried. Hopefully, my wife understands that being in hiding is basically the same as being in prison, except that there's a much worse chance of being released because they'll have to live with guilt and fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1000	Yes, because they're not sure if they'll attack you and then one night when you don't expect it, they'll try to kill you because they have the idea that you know the truth and the truth can't be revealed and they must get rid of all the clues that they love, even if they try to talk to someone.
1001	I'm not kidding, but you're saying that the government should be helping us with our belief system. Have you ever read T. Hobbes?
1002	I don't think abortion is right, if a mother isn't capable of conceiving a baby, and if she is about to be killed, I think it's wrong, but necessary. Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a baby, born or unborn.
1003	I'm not seeing any difference between killing an embroider and a 40-year-old man.
1004	One question: Why do we argue for the right to kill the unborn when our government is robbing us of our real rights?
1005	Well, "The Champ" we're not talking about a woman's body, we're talking about a new life, and if you're going to be irresponsible, don't let that life die for it!
1006	Besides, only a couple of people use physical activity throughout their lives!
1007	It must be very easy for a PE teacher, they don't need to know anything, they just shout at the children for an hour.
1008	Gym class is a waste of time for students, and if they can't run a mile without stopping every few feet, they should be in it. And also, if they want to be better prepared for sports, they should be given that time to do so rather than just sitting there.
1009	Do gay marriages hurt anybody? No, do gay marriages kill many people? No, do gay marriages affect the world in any way? No, do gay marriages affect the two of you in any way? No, then why are straight people so insulted? If you want a marriage between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it to be between you, do you want it
1010	You cannot choose a lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call a lifestyle a "choice" if you are not that person and know that homosexuality is not a choice.
1011	It's better if people are people who want to be the best they can be and they want to be the best. I'm sure I want to be the "winner" and that means that someone else must be the loser.
1012	It is more important to pursue personal interests, because if you want to help others, you must help yourself. It is not wrong to help the common good, but if you always put other people before yourself, you may start to forget your needs and desires in life.
1013	Some people find that helping others is their way of pursuing their happiness, because it takes them a lot of time to be happy and to go out and do something for everyone else.
1014	Obviously, everyone wants to say that they would help humanity, the world or save a city, but only a few percent would actually do it. I would like to help humanity, but I am posting this under personal interest because I do not know what I would do in a situation like that.
1015	I think it's better to pursue personal goals, because it's more about you than it is about other people. If you can't concentrate on yourself, how can you concentrate on others or help them? I don't mean that advancing the common good is bad, I just say it's better to focus on yourself.
1016	Honestly, I believe that both of them are good, there's no better or worse in this argument, because they both have a meaning and balance each other out. Personal pursuits, because you improve yourself for others and the environment around you, and then you make a contribution to the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect, and we don't live in a perfect world, and I don't expect it to be that way.
1017	A number of reasons.. 'Cause girls don't think their safety is their priority anymore and if parents warn them, they react by going all out with guys, giving them the opportunity they want to have, because the "safety antenna" of girls isn't as sensitive as it should be, so they don't get raped.
1018	You can't use this conversation as evidence in court, and I don't know what the woman was trying to accomplish by recording it. Some people are addicted to drama, and they're doing everything in their power to create more drama.
1019	No, you cannot be forced to, but it may damage your credibility, so you can instead make a formal statement. I do not "believe" in the gods, nor will I swear an oath in any State or Government. I will not swear an oath in any State or Government. I will instead make a formal statement, which is effective and completely legal. It also saves notary fees.
1020	I think the executor should divide the remains equally, so that you get a fair share of whatever's sold. If they sell it, it doesn't matter if they've already spent their share, they still owe you your share. You can sue them. It's a shame people act so selfishly and unethically towards one another when their parents die.
1021	The purpose of punishment is to reform the criminals, but in some cases the criminal is beyond the reformation stage and he is enjoying his criminal activities, such as serial killers, psychopaths, and in some other grave cases the convict committed such heinous crimes that the consciousness of the ordinary person is shaken, and capital punishment is needed to prevent others from repeating the same crimes. The law commission has recommended not to ban capital punishment in India, but in its various reports, it has also recommended that it should not be banned.
1022	While driving, you need to be completely focused on the road, and using a cell phone makes you lose sight of the number, and you need two hands on the wheel. Please don't use the cell phone while driving. Even though there might be no law in your state, it's always good to set an example.
1023	First of all, the ACLU is not involved in this case. It usually deals only with cases where the government interferes with civil liberties. Second of all, where is your source for this case? You have some specific details, so I'm sure you have some news article or a link to more information. I don't trust your statement. Thirdly, the answer to your question is "no."
1024	Is it not the NY Times, at least they're the paper Bush's administration is after, although the government has a website and a magazine dedicated to this very issue, and that's not all! And don't forget all the other media outlets that've printed the same story, what a scam! Bush himself has made over 12 public statements since September 2001, mentioning how he disrupts terrorist funding!
1025	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
1026	Looks like you're afraid of him having rights to raise the child if you die. If you don't want him to have rights to the child, you need to get him to sign a document giving him rights away. Of course, if he signs the document, he won't be responsible for child support. Check with your local social services office and ask them, "If he signs the document giving rights away to the child, will the back child support still be collected?"... Yes, bring him in and establish paternity.
1027	Even if the sentence was ridiculous from the start? For example, I spent years trying to get a woman out of 20 years in prison for possession of 2/3rds of a gram, and even though she had betrayed me when she got out, and caused me great pain, I still don't think it was right to keep her in jail for so long.
1028	You were eligible for unemployment, if not, you committed fraud. It can be a crime in most states. I would try and solve this before they catch you. Today, employees in most states are required to report new employees to the state because of child support laws. This is one way of tracking you. The second major way is your taxes. When you file, they will see W-2s with your husbands and/or your names on them.
1029	I'm not sure where you got the idea that foster care costs the state tons of money. My sister does it for a living and their departments are severely underfunded and understaffed. The workers do what they can, but unfortunately, until everyone gets the message that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads, the situation will not improve. It's really sad. My sister alone has about 50 cases to attend to and she has to spend at least one visit and attend court monthly. There aren't enough hours in a day. Each caseworker should only have about 20 cases, but they don't have the funds to hire enough people.
1030	I don't know exactly what you mean, but in general, I think we should see moral and legal as Venn diagrams, an act can be both, one of them or neither. We wouldn't want it any other way, actually.
1031	I'm not sure, I always call my electrician to repair my pipe. Maybe he's a general practitioner lawyer who specializes in a lot of different types of cases. Or maybe he's a fool, and you're kicking him around in court.
1032	I'm not an American, I'm a Canadian, and I pride myself on that fact. There are things I admire and envy in the U.S., but there are also things I don't like or admire, like this war in Iraq.
1033	If you're in Michigan, they'll do it. Michigan doesn't tolerate underage drinking.
1034	I'm sorry to hear the UK is going down such a rough path, but I think the right to swing my arms is limited to a couple of inches from my face, and I think you have the right to speak what you want, except if it threatens someone else.
1035	It depends on what you want and what impression you want to give. If you want to give the impression that you are a fine citizen who should not be held accountable, I would choose none of the abovementioned items and go with the Birks. If you don't care about the impression you want to give, I would choose the Birks.
1036	Civil rights, we're innocent until proven guilty, and having everyone in a database would be the opposite of what you'd like, like, "You're a criminal waiting to get out of line"- terrible! It could even have the opposite effect, like, "They think you're a criminal already, so why not commit a crime?" We still have the right to privacy, and having all our details in a database, microchipping us when we haven't done anything wrong, would be a huge breach of privacy.
1037	I think the sentences for drug addicts should be harsher, and the sentences for murderers and rapists should be stricter. It takes too long to get justice for 30 years of appeals and the legal system.
1038	It's not legal because it can't be regulated by the government, because it's generally considered to be a gateway drug that leads to other, more dangerous drugs, and because, since it hasn't always been legal, like in some European countries, legalizing it would not only cause massive initial interest in it, which would lead to higher healthcare costs (don't front; it damages respiratory systems and impairs judgment), and lower wages, and all those drug dealers who sell weed would need to find something else to do, and my guess is it wouldn't be a legitimate job, and probably would cause a rise in crime, probably gun sales, or increased trafficking in worse drugs.
1039	What's the point of having sex with minors, or minors having sex with one another? If it's a good woman and a male minor, then it's okay. If it's a guy and a girl minor, then it's wrong. If it's two minors together, then the law should be a little more gentle.
1040	If you and your mother are okay, I don't see a reason you shouldn't leave for your own. Check the local laws and statutes. Most likely, you'll be 18 years old, but there's exceptions. If you're staying with a family and you're "underage", you need to modify the guardianship agreement. But I don't think that's going to make a whole lot of difference for you or anyone else, anywhere. I say, pack your bags and go with your mom's blessing, find your destiny as my child, have fun and stay out of trouble, okay?
1041	Since stem cells are abundant in the blood of the umbilical cord after childbirth, there is no need for a moral trade-off. I favor harvesting stem cells from donated cord blood and I do not see any reason at all why embryonic cells are needed at all in order to carry out the research that holds such incredible promises.
1042	I think it's a joke that if a criminal commits murder, he or she is going to be punished with the death penalty, and I'm sure that many people in prison would have preferred that to the death penalty.
1043	I don't know if it's a question or a US attack, but I often ask myself that question. The most honest answer might be that we can control our technology and we have the power to control proliferation because we see it as a danger.
1044	You're going to be fine, provided you have the education and the training. But you must realize that the people you're dealing with are operating in a world where survival and power are everything.
1045	I know it's a cliché, but it's not an insult. India is rich in history and culture, but it's not poor.
1046	I'm sure if a suspect didn't want to talk but was forced to, he'd make up a lot of garbage and waste cops' time anyway.
1047	If the person is mentally impaired and can prove it, then I don't think he should be prosecuted. But if someone is supposed to be looking after or guardianship of the mentally impaired person, then he may be held responsible for not fully supervising. I also think HUNGER is a mitigating circumstance in any case of food stealing, if it isn't, it should be.
1048	No, you're using the equipment you've been provided with your employment, and the school has the right to see that you don't misuse it for any illicit purpose. If you don't like the conditions for using school computers for e-mail, then you should stop using them. And they'll also monitor the websites that you and your pupils visit.
1049	Because we don't learn about alcohol at a young age, and if we had been treated like Europeans, it wouldn't have been considered taboo. And that's why so many teenagers drink till they were sick and act like twits.
1050	I'm 18 years old, if you ask me, yes, it's still young, but you should have finished high school and lived under your parents' law for a long time. As for drinking, let's be real, if someone underage wants to drink, they can buy liq, it's not that hard.
1051	No, he's already over his head in California, and right now, there's a president who isn't really up to the challenges of being president, and I'm not going to repeat that. And I think that he should be born here, and all other jobs could be taken by somebody else with legal status, but not the presidency.
1052	I'm sure I don't fear "the competition" - Besides my husband's good at home, most prostitutes I've seen are far from "very pretty" - Most of them are drug addicts who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized that they could make money off their twat. I believe it should be legalized, because it removes much of the mystery and sordidity from the whole thing. And they also regularly test their bodies for diseases in most places where it's legal, which obviously solves a major problem.
1053	The state's hands are clean, and an innocent person will always choose the confinement, so that new evidence can be found that proves their innocence. No more dead innocents. * The convicts' freedom of choice is maintained, which is of course important. * The convicts' freedom of expression is maintained, and that is important. * The convicts' freedom of expression is maintained, and that is what is important. * The convicts' freedom of expression is maintained, and that is what is important. * The convicts' freedom of expression is maintained, and that is what is important.
1054	We're born, we live, we die. These are the constants in our lives. We're aware that these things will happen. So why should I be motivated to do anything? Why should I do a lousy job that I don't care about? Why should I keep in touch with people? I'm in a position now where I'm in a transitional period. Conflict in society is meaningless. I should just be a lonesome person, living in a world full of cats.
1055	The "be yourself" attitude hurts the people who have it, and everybody around them. It's an excuse to do all kinds of stupid things and not improve yourself.
1056	I'm sure there's a need for change, but I don't think I've heard one coherent argument. Again, I fully support equality, but beating every single person you meet is not the most efficient way of accomplishing it. And every person I've ever met who supports it is mean and a bit of a bully. I'm looking for proof that progress has been made recently or how aggressive it is.
1057	You don't have any control over where you come from, just like you don't have any control over your skin color. It's as if you were a fan of a team just because they are the one Canadian team left in the Stanley Cup competition.
1058	It is becoming increasingly clear that the country is not functioning to the best of its citizens, and I do not see it ever reaching a balance that would be satisfactory. The culture there is still going directly to idolization and total submission, and people are becoming more and more programmed to accept it with generations. People are working and barely able to sustain themselves. I believe the two countries should be united and the South Korean system should be accepted. This is difficult to say, but it is a better outcome than continuing in the way it is going. How this will happen is not really a concern in the subject discussed.
1059	I'm sure the whole #bringbackourgirls thing is self defeating, but I don't think it makes sense. In fact, I think it's a paradox that increases the effectiveness of terrorist acts, and in a way supports/promotes their style by adding fuel to the fire of terrorists without having any real power to change anything. Whilst there will always be smug campaigns that are more about feeling better about doing some armchair activism than real will to change, I think that many people will feel that this particular campaign has a lot of merit, so that it keeps the cause in the public conscience, and I don't think it works this time, for the reasons I mentioned above.
1060	I'd like to see some research on shooting large amounts of garbage into the sun, or space in general, and it will probably break down before it reaches the sun. Perhaps we could do it once or twice a year where we're certain it will land, or perhaps we should just shoot it into the vast openness of space. On a scale, it's highly unlikely that it will hit anything in the next few hundred years.
1061	_____ I'm aware that most people are now able to have children, but I don't think it's right. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are looking for a babysitter, and spending over $3000 on a surrogate isn't right. Also, the most successful surrogate agencies are in foreign countries where they take advantage of women because they can afford so little to use their bodies, and childbirth can take a lot of women's physical and emotional resources, so knowing that a woman went through all this to give birth to a baby she won't see again doesn't make sense.
1062	I've seen a lot of polyamory in the media lately, and the comments on those articles tend not to be very positive, with people tending to say "No" or "Ick".
1063	I'm sure it's a very sad thing to think about, but I don't think that a person is mentally prepared to make a lifelong choice at the age of 20 or so, and I think that most people in that time, who were mostly middle aged, were married at the latest around the age of 30 or so, and that was considered a very late marriage.
1064	I'm not trying to be jealous, I'm saying that the amount of money they're getting is too much.
1065	I'm partly inspired by the "new look" Ronald McDonald that was recently released on Twitter. I think companies using cartoons or clowns as part of their marketing strategy for children are unethical. They create a link early on in the development of impressionable minds about the fun and safe nature of the products. And when a person reaches adulthood, the link is permanent, and they still consume them out of nostalgia for childhood.
1066	_ I'm an Australian, and I'm a big fan of sports, and I've been trying to watch all the games, but I've found that there's a lot of fluency and action missing from both of them. I feel like I've missed or not appreciated something in these sports, and if I knew more of the hidden aspects, I'd like to enjoy them even more. Are these sports really exciting, or are they just ingrained in American culture so much that the attractiveness and appeal of the real game is a afterthought? Please change my mind, as I'd like to get involved.
1067	I don't know why employers are allowed to pay two dollars an hour and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage, and I don't think anyone should be guilted into paying X percentage on top of the bill at a restaurant to pay the servers wages when it should be their employers.
1068	Look at Florida's major metropolis, they're tops in technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. I've spent my entire life here, and it's disheartening. I know why my friends are leaving because it's nothing more than a waiting room for God.
1069	I don't mean that we shouldn't think about potential disasters, but I think the focus of the AI research right now is on imitating the cortex's memory system and building really powerful classifiers.
1070	Increasingly, I understand that police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers, and I'm afraid they're abusing trust. In fact, they've been trying to install cameras in many places that have proven to reduce incidents and false accusations of abuse, but they've been opposed to their implementation. This makes me feel as though they're trying to hide crimes and widespread systemic abuse. When I smoke marijuana, I'm far more at risk of danger than anyone else, and that danger is only getting worse with the increasing militarization of America.
1071	Sure, some brand styling choices could be understood, but in almost forty years, we've figured out what a general purpose video game controller should be: two thumbsticks, four thumb buttons on the right, an 8-way directional pad on the left, two bumper buttons and two triggers. Why is there a difference between the two buttons on the left and the right, when the controllers are functionally identical in every way? I think there's a better layout, (which I think is, is irrelevant), and one company simply won't change because of its insistence.
1072	I'd like to think that Duchamp's Fountain was an early and successful example of asking the question, "what art is", but it hasn't been done in the gallery since.
1073	First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor in Group G is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.
1074	I admit that I am limited in my understanding of the necessity of outsourcing American projects to China in order to ensure that Chinese families can survive without any active effort to alleviate poverty. If a family loses their jobs, they cannot afford to eat, rent or buy clothes. Furthermore, if the outsourcing is eliminated, prices in the world would increase dramatically, which would affect people who are currently living on the edge of poverty themselves.
1075	* Everyone knows that the war on drugs is a failure, but it's not right to presume that people should be able to smoke drugs without fear of criminal charges. * Everybody should be able to get help for addiction without fear of criminal charges. * Everybody should be able to buy government approved, pure drugs and know what they are.
1076	In the context of the recent Indian election, which Narendra Modi won by a landslide, I cannot see anything good about him in the long run. Besides, he will destroy the religious tolerance India is famous for. It would be better to keep the Congress, who are as corrupt as all hell, but are not responsible for the massacre of Muslim pilgrims (the 2002 Gujarat riots, where up to 2,000 Muslim pilgrims were massacred and Modi was accused of complicity).
1077	It is also possible that our media does not show all the real horrors of war, the dead soldiers, the grieving families, etc., and so on. And there are thousands of other grotesque details that cannot be translated well into the media, like the mental anguish, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.,
1078	I'm not the one who created this topic, but I would support legalizing marijuana if it is still illegal to sell or advertise it to minors and if it is not used in motor vehicles. There are several benefits to legalizing marijuana: 1) People who were arrested for marijuana use would have a second chance to get back into work; 2) the number of prisoners would be reduced; 3) Taxing marijuana like all goods and services would bring in revenue for the government; and 4) The government would be able to make more money on the tax base than it would otherwise be.
1079	Yes, it's safer than alcohol, it's almost impossible to overdose, and if it were legal, it would be easier to regulate. An excellent example would be prohibition, which was legal, but people still did it, just like they did with weed, and it cost a lot of cops to hunt down speakeasys, which would have been used to solve more pressing cases like the murder of Mr. Burns and the last donut. When prohibition was repealed, the organization had returned to society as well.
1080	There's really no debate here, but no one checks the forums and I want to get some attention. This website has become a stagnant waste. There's almost no intellectual stimulation anymore. The lack of quality debates is almost smothering the lack of general participation. It used to be that I couldn't stay away from this site, now I have to make an effort just to spend a couple of minutes every few days logged in. This needs to change.
1081	It is not about whether children should eat candy, but whether advertising for children portraying candy consumption as a good thing. It is not about whether children should be allowed to see advertisements for children that promote candy consumption as a good thing.
1082	In fact, there's been dozens of cases in the last 100 years where a country has invaded another country, and the world has risen against it. And yet, a stupid Texas is doing it, and he's gotten away with it.
1083	Well, truth be told, truth is different for each of us. My truth is that when I flush the toilet, the water goes counterclockwise, but someone in Brazil's truth is that it goes counterclockwise. Who's right, well, in a sense, we're both right. Scenarios define truth.
1084	It is safe to say that not every position played in the NFL is equally paid. Kickers are not paid as much as running backs, and running backs are not paid as much as quarterbacks. Hence, quarterbacks are paid more because their success depends more on their decisions than on any other position on the team.
1085	I've been pleased to hear his briefing today, and it's clear that he's taking a hit because of the comparison of Bush's Katrina to the oil spill, but that he's not taking it very seriously.
1086	I'd like to begin by defining what wrestling is Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two unharmed persons, in which each wrestler aims to gain an advantage over or control the other. Is this what we see on television today? No, the definition above clearly contradicts what we see today. Many people witness the use of chairs, bats, etc. as weapons, which means that they are harmed.
1087	We're all aware that men want to have sex to impress their friends and show that they have it, and then they'll leave the girl after they've had sex with another girl, and then they'll go out with another girl who will give them some, and so on. We all know that when they're in a situation where they're pressured to have sex, they're pressured to leave the girl, and then they're going to go out with another girl, and so on. We all know that when they're in a situation where they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to leave the girl, and then they're going to go out with another girl, and so on. We all know that when they're in a situation where they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have sex, and they're pressured to have
1088	MJ: We should not have to pay for education, because it is essential for society's functioning. If people are unable to afford the price of education, the consequences will be that many children's futures will collapse. Education is the force that enables people to achieve their goals and success. What right do we have to refuse education simply because they cannot afford it?
1089	Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all things have been fulfilled." If I am missing something, Heaven and Earth are still in existence, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happened. I begin with these words from the Messiah Yahushua, and take him at his word as he is no liar.
1090	In fact, China has kept its currency very low so that it can continue to supply very cheap goods to the United States. But, if the dollar is too low in comparison, Chinese goods will cost more, which will hurt American consumers in the short run but will strengthen the domestic market for American producers, but it will not improve before it gets better.
1091	I went here for dinner last night in Montreal last summer, and it seemed to me that the place was very popular and crowded. There were a lot of wrong orders, and the food was not what you ordered.
1092	Finally, the new place is fantastic, and the food is absolutely fantastic. We had the rib taco and the brisket taco, and also the slaw and the black beans, which were fresh and delicious. We'd like to thank you for your reservation, which was made very quickly.
1093	We went to lunch at Zeta's and had the meat shawarma pita and my husband had the Gyro. Both were great. They started with the bread and olive oil and it was really good.
1094	I don't know why this place is so poorly rated, but I was very impressed with the food, drinks and the patio! I was a little late in ordering, but it was fine for me. The nachos were delicious and the fish tacos were very good. The Caesar was the best I've ever had. I think the restaurant was slow and rough when it opened, which probably caused the poor reviews, but I'd advise you to try it. The prices are great, the menu is great and the atmosphere is perfect for a summer night out!
1095	I went there at 6pm on 10/20/2013 and had a group of 6. We ordered hummus for starters and the main entrees were potato pizza, Lobster gnocchi, roast chicken and burgers. We all had diarrhea at night, some with stomach pain, one with acid reflex and gas. Two of us had gas problems and we won't be back there again.
1096	There's not much else in Mesa for wine bars, and D'Vine has always been a good refuge when I wanted to stay in town. It's just around the corner and it's a lot less hassle than driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale. The food's been good, the staff's nice, the atmosphere's nice, and the live music's been great. All I want is that they stay open a bit later on weekends for us night owls, at 11pm.
1097	I'm so in love with this place that I always wonder why we didn't come back sooner. We tend to forget about it a bit because it's not too flashy, but the food is always great. Chicken, beef, Fleek, rice, beans, PLANTAINS? God, stop it. It's so good.
1098	I've wasted time, money and precious calories on this place. I wish I had gone to McDonalds and had the same experience, if not better. Now I'm just enjoying a fresh salad because of the extra calories I have sacrificed for nothing.
1099	I'm sorry about that, but I love the tab option. The last time I checked, you had to start a new browser to browse two websites at the same time. It's useless.
1100	Firefox is the best, I'm sure because I've got it. The reason people use IE is because it's the default browser on most machines. I bet 90% of the people who support IE know just one browser.
1101	I wouldn't have turned him in if my husband had committed murder, but I would have been there for him, better or worse. Yes, he's made a big mistake and should be held accountable, but I don't think I have the guts to turn him in. We need to protect one another and be there for one another, no matter how terrible it is.
1102	I don't think I'd be able to get my wife or family and friends back if they killed someone, because they're too close to me and I couldn't imagine my life without them. Why would anyone send away a loved one who they love, especially if you live with them?
1103	I'd say books are better because they require you to use your imagination, so the more you read, the more your imagination improves, and it helps you improve your reading, grammar, and writing skills. I also hate commercials, and I don't like Spongebob.
1104	Even books help us with our electricity bill, which uses up a lot of our spending money
1105	You're smarter because of books, and they can tell you what people think.
1106	It's absolutely ridiculous to say the people who can't read would always run away from them, even those who love books and B for best. Books are the best. I can't sleep if I don't read a chapter of a novel every day. Actually, sometimes I feel that reading books all day becomes boring (in school textbooks and at home novels), so I watch TV and those two news channels, and I can even pass my time by reading books.
1107	All we can say is a big IF, because we don't know if India can lead the world alone, and maybe it won't be led by India in the future. But there are still countries that are more progressive, more intelligent, more powerful than India, like the U.S., Japan, etc., and they haven't got enough potential and ability to sustain the needs of their people. India isn't yet as advanced and advanced as America, but it is one of the most advanced and essential inventions ever made.
1108	Well, it's not a simple question to answer, because it's the same thing that I do. But I would say fatherless, 'cause I'd rather not have a man in my life than someone who doesn't care about your life at all.
1109	Father's there for you, teaches you how to throw a baseball, and goes to all your baseball games. Father's there to keep you safe from all evil in the world.
1110	It's just my opinion, but it's better not to have a bad father than to have a bad father.
1111	I'm sure both of them are wrong, but I'd rather not have a father who's not good.
1112	Raffles had founded Singapore, and Farquhar was just a subordinate of him. So, it was normal that Raffles had given the task of making Singapore a prosperous city and left the city to Farquhar.
1113	I mean, the people who watch porn, it's fine, it's normal, but the people who are in the porn, it's not normal. I read about it in an abnormal psychology book, that means they have a disorder.
1114	And this isn't just about morality, it's also affecting how women are treated in society today. This is against women's empowerment because they're merely toys, which will eventually affect how men perceive women and how they perceive them.
1115	I don't understand why they're doing this, they're violating the rights of females and they're being abused. It's also sick, what kind of freak would film people having sex?! I don't understand. I don't understand why they're doing this.
1116	PORN is wrong, why would you want to watch people have sex? Maybe everyone feels differently, but still if you want to watch people have sex, take a mirror and look at yourself.
1117	Jarman's porn is wrong, because it should be in 4D with surround sound and special effects, it would be much more enjoyable.
1118	Then, according to your theory, the fruit flies would adapt and survive. And I don't know exactly how this argument works.
1119	* If evolution is true, why are people not evolving?
1120	Actually, you don't have to know anything about debate because what I do is called "Cross Examining" and it's a very common tactic for exposing weaknesses in the opponent's position. And, also, calling names has never been successful in a debate. You just don't know what to say and I'm sure you're frustrated.
1121	1. Why is creation not science? 2. Why is it classified as a religion? 3. Are you disillusioned people who think you look like monkeys?
1122	Hey, IE's got the world's finest virus interface, so why don't you embrace these little cute viruses by upgrading to MS-Ice?
1123	It says FF loads faster than IE, but 9 times out of 10 people who just installed FF experience a slower program load time than IE loading.
1124	I apologize to the Firefox users who lost the game, I'm sorry to see you cry about IE somewhere else.
1125	If physical education wasn't that bad, you'd be a couch potato.
1126	At that time there were many pests, and people were suffering. Raffles was not there, and William had to come up with a solution himself.
1127	William had legalized gambling for Singapore to prosper, but Raffles had refused, leaving Singapore to prosper.
1128	Farquhar had made a significant contribution, even paying his own money to establish a colony out of the jungle, by offering money as incentives for the people to hunt and exterminate rats and centipedes, while Raffles had done nothing like that.
1129	The real work was being carried out by Farquhar, while Raffles was just imagining the ideas that wouldn't work or that would.
1130	Even though William had done much for Singapore, Farquhar was wrongly exiled by Raffles.
1131	I don't think that a mother should have the right to kill her child, but she should have the right to decide whether or not to consider the fetus a human being.
1132	People can choose for themselves, and we and governments are not responsible for bringing more unwanted children into this world.
1133	A few years ago, a nine-year-old girl from South America was raped and had twins, and her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but they wouldn't let her have an abortion because they were Catholics. Those three lives were all but lost.
1134	Abortion is okay because the fetus is not a human. To be human, you have to be both IMO and HOMOSPIE. And you have to be able to contribute to society. Those criteria make it impossible to consider the fetus human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.
1135	For those of you who think that life begins at conception rather than birth, America grants citizenship to people born here but not to people who are conceived here. Perhaps if you really think that life begins at conception and you are a full human being with rights to life, then perhaps we should grant citizenship to you, too.
1136	All I'm saying is that evolution is supported by real evidence!!
1137	It's not like God's coming to judge us in 2100, is it? It's not 2000, why would he have to change it? He created some tiny organisms billions of years ago, and then said, "I'll start this evolution and see what happens. Yes, I'll change it a little, maybe someday, I can make Mary give birth to Jesus."
1138	How come people don't evolve, and how are you so sure we aren't? Please show me some proof that we aren't evolving, and don't say it, because we'd notice if we were. Solid, verifiable evidence is the key to proving your point.
1139	We have an exciting and passionate love life with my wife, we love pornography and use it to spice it up a bit, set the room on fire. It's a way to share and expand our love for each other in the bedroom, so it shouldn't be a problem as long as everyone is legal and age.
1140	I think it's better to help others than to pursue personal goals, because it's always a good thing to help others. It's more probable that things will turn out well when you assist others.
1141	I think it's better to advance the common good because it not only makes you feel better, but it also helps you to help others.
1142	It's a planet Earth, shared by billions, and if you have the opportunity to advance humanity, you should do it. Choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfishness, and that's all you need to know.
1143	It is better to advance the common good than to pursue personal interests. If every person decides to advance the common good, he will see the results of his actions. But, of course, most people choose personal interests because they will benefit from them.
1144	I'm sure you know how you feel, think and believe, if you want to change, you will change yourself.
1145	I think it's better to advance the common good, because it's going to come back to you eventually. And if you improve the world in any way, you'll be helped, whether it's money, glory or just karma.
1146	It's a good idea to separate students from other people, at least to get more work done on the uniform. Why do we wear military uniforms? To separate us from civil. Why do terrorists not wear military uniforms? To be in harmony with civility and easy to attack the enemy.
1147	School uniforms are not harmful to students' lives, now imagine a bully wearing a shirt, tie, pants, all neatly ironed and perfectly clean shoes, he won't look good. Remember, your appearance is also part of your interview.
1148	I'd say it's better to have a bad father, because at least you have someone there. The fact that he's bad doesn't mean you can't change him. Maybe you could make him better.
1149	It's good to have a bad father, it's good to have a role model to look up to, and without that, you could get lost in the world. A bad father isn't that bad, because he's always working and not having time for you. A bad father isn't the one who makes you want to be like him, or motivates you to be better than him.
1150	It's better to have a bad father, because he won't go into your business, search your room, take your stuff because he doesn't think I need it. He wouldn't be angry, throw my backpack with my computer in it at the wall, ripping a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or forget my keys.
1151	I'm not going to be here, like punching my dream, breathing life into my nightmare, and if it collapses, I'm sure I'll wake up. Bright lights will clean me up, this is worse than it looks.
1152	I think TV is better than books, because you can switch between information channels and documentaries on different subjects, and when you've finished your learning and you're ready to rest, you can switch between comedy and whatever else you want to watch.
1153	If you're only fluent in one language and you move to another country, the majority of books aren't your language, but TV's in other languages and you can hear how they spell.
1154	Same sex marrage can cause a lot of confusion, it puts people's lives in danger in extreme cases. Gay marrage has caused so much trouble that it has resulted in murder and suicide
1155	I remember that after sixty years of independence India was the only country that Alexander's army was afraid of, and that was India. And I know that none of us are unfamiliar with the great contribution India has made to the discovery of God, then from where does the fact that India does not have the potential come from?
1156	India has the potential to lead the world, but I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon.
1157	We have scientific evidence that the Noah Flood could not have happened.
1158	Honestly, I think it's better to try something else, rather than spanking the kid, which may affect his thinking and make him sad.
1159	Honestly, I don't think spanking a child should be tolerated. There are many ways for parents to deal with this, so we have a mouth and say what's right and wrong and what's wrong.
1160	Some parents spank their children for everything, and that's wrong. They'll always be afraid of them.
1161	Even if it may sometimes seem necessary to spank your children, in my opinion, it should always be the last resort.
1162	I would, no one should get away with murder, not that I'd ever marry someone who would murder someone. But that's not the point.
1163	I'd have to turn them in if my wife had murdered, because I don't think I'd be able to live knowing she murdered someone. The relationship would have changed, because now you see them as someone else, you don't see them as your spouse anymore, you just see them as a bad person who could have done something to you.
1164	I'm going to bring him in if my husband murders somebody, because I've learned that everything has a consequence, and he must bear the consequences of his crime.
1165	I'd definitely turn her in, because she's a murderer, and she's a crazy person who could kill me or somebody else. I'd have to live in fear of her killing, because if I don't turn her in, someone will eventually find out about it, and I could get arrested for it, but it would be a shame if I didn't.
1166	Don't be foolhardy. Most abortions in this country are done for convenience. If I could kill someone whenever it was inconvenient for me, I would leave a trail of corpses on the street when I walked.
1167	All right, no, and yes, physical education should be a way of teaching students how to live a healthy life, not to run 10 laps around a track, but to show them that eating right and exercising can be fun, not to bully an obese child because they cannot run as fast as someone else.
1168	I'm not interested in whether or not the term "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage. Civil union, marriage, the union of two souls, or whatever you call it, gays need to be given equal rights to a married couple. It's a pity that the Supreme Court hasn't taken up this case, because it's left to the states, and Bush wants to add an amendment that says what marriage is.
1169	There's a debate about whether gay marriage is acceptable or not, but I think everybody should have the right to express their feelings for someone they love. Why can't a man express his feelings for a woman or a man and a woman who is gay, but not for a woman? I think gays should have the right to do what they like when they want to!
1170	First of all, homosexuals have a fundamental right to happiness. Second, they are still part of society. Thirdly, allowing third genders equal rights to marriage would make the government look better.
1171	It's a matter of personal choice if your religion or culture doesn't allow gay marriage, but that doesn't mean you don't want to marry someone of the same sex. But why should it apply to other religions or cultures? Gays marrying don't have any impact on the marriage of the opposite gender, they just marry and continue as you do.
1172	For example, a person who wants to succeed in life and achieves his objectives, when he is already successful and using money to help others, decides to help others.
1173	I'm more selfish, so I'd rather do something that would improve my life, but I guess it depends on how I feel. Right now, I'm going to pursue a personal interest.
1174	I'm not sure he killed his exwife and her friend, but this book, which is of poor taste and is very insulting, is his desperate attempt to persuade the overwhelming majority that he is innocent. I think he's lost his mind, and since he's lost his civil case, he should be ordered to pay back the profits of the book and the other profitable ventures.
1175	The First Amendment of the Bill of Rights says, "Congress shall not make any law respecting the establishment of religion or the prohibition of the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech or the press, or the right of the people peacefully to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievance." -Speech also means expression.
1176	No, you're not better off "always" wearing one, as the radio said today. About 30,000 people die every year in the U.S. for not wearing their seatbelts and about 10,000 die every year because they didn't have one. It's a violation of my rights, but I can't afford the fine, and they're tougher on the fine lately.
1177	There are Scientology schools, and I've never heard of them being taught in public schools, but it's probably because of some groups that do things for the community without advertising.
1178	Yes, I've worked with a couple of local police departments, and I believe in all of them. And when it comes to the city where I'm from, I'm very fond of it. There are some good cops there, and they're kind and loving, and they're doing their best for the community. The chief's great, and he's backing them up.
1179	I would file a complaint immediately with the U.S. Attorney's office, the FBI, and your local police chief, and I would contact every media outlet that I could find with the details of the case. If you have any extra cash lying around, I would file a civil suit against both the officer and the business owner. You have clearly been wronged, and I am only 21 years old, so don't think about stepping down.
1180	I'm thinking that sentence them to life in prison, and we'll keep them in the general population with a T-shirt that says, "I'm a terrorist and I'm killing innocent women and children." I'm sure the guards will turn their backs on whatever unfortunate thing has happened to a criminal who has been convicted.
1181	It's happening all over the world, even bad countries aren't held accountable. For instance, Israel was caught breaking the law (occupying another people's land), why was it protected by the US through Veto Power and not militarily kicked out like any normal country would have been? (ex. Iraq out of Kuwait, etc.) In conclusion, the correct answer to your question is that the world is unfair, and that some people have guns and "protection", like some states have big guns and "protection", the law is lenient.
1182	I'd like the person who is responsible for the murder to bear the cost, and if he happens to be in the gas chamber or the lethal injection, then that's fine. It won't bring back the love of my family, but I'd be happy to know that he couldn't do it again.
1183	Let's see, Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany, 1945, and President Bush is alive and well in 2006. If one of them can travel back in time, it's impossible to be the same person.
1184	As for property, if it's in your house, nobody can take it without a warrant or a criminal complaint that says it was stolen. Since it's unlikely the cops will lie about the report, I wouldn't worry too much about the property. In fact, the cops don't have the right to enter your house or property without warrant in most cases, except in cases of domestic violence. In the case of the child, you need to consult a local lawyer. There are too many variables for anyone to give you specific or precise advice on the Internet. Good luck and keep going.
1185	No, if the legs were kept shut, there wouldn't have been any more trouble, but there are plenty of people who would like to but couldn't. And as for the health, my child has a right to live longer than I do, and abortion isn't good for the health of a woman either, you see?
1186	If a minor is under 12 years old, I'd say "no," but at 12 I think you're pretty well aware of what you're doing and the consequences. And there's been some murders in the U.S. that were planned, planned, and committed by 12 and 13 year olds, and I think they should not only be tried and punished as adults, but also as criminals.
1187	I agree, the liberal demacrates have made it okay to do all these things. If drugs or alchahal were a band, they would IMMEDIATELY demand that the law be "unconstitutional." I heard that George Washington was praying in a school because he was "unconstitutional." He was our Founding Father. And they just took his picture out because they thought it was a sign of Christian values. But they teach the kids about hinduism and judisum, but when it comes to Christianity, it's ILLEGAL to teach the kids about that. And instead of trying to keep kids away from sex, they are handing out CONDOMS and trying to "encourge the MTO safe.
1188	First, I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that tried to fight liquor licenses. It's not entrapment to send a minor decoy into a liquor store and see if the clerk will sell it. It's just entrapment if the clerk is predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors.
1189	No, there's a reason you have to be an adult to be on jury. Young people don't usually have the intelligence or maturity necessary to make objective decisions based on evidence, and tend to follow what their emotions tell them, which isn't possible in court.
1190	If that's all the story, then that outcome is completely illogical. There's nothing wrong with touching another person's head, shoulder, leg, back, etc., but there's something wrong when someone touches something that clearly wasn't happening and wasn't going to happen in the middle of the street. What should have happened? The parents should have lectured their daughter, the daughter should have lectured her father, and the man should have lectured him about being smarter in a society full of lawsuits and sex crimes. There's no need for trials or arrests. And how is someone who isn't guilty of a crime, who isn't being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted, who is being prosecuted,
1191	Oh, please, let's get rid of this useless pursuit and try to do something other than this pointless pursuit. The chances of legalizing marijuana are slim, at least the way things are going now. Ban smoking everywhere, cooking methods, what you can and cannot say. We're in a "control your every shape for your own good" nanny mood now.
1192	Polygraphs use a baseline, and they go from there. If your friend was nervous at the start, that would be his baseline. Changes, not totals. It would have to be extreme to fail. Even if his English wasn't great, it shouldn't have affected anything.
1193	I don't think that affirmative action is a good idea, but it is necessary in some cases. The biggest problem we have today is that the playing field isn't as level as some people think it is.
1194	You know, your ex-husband has a child or children to support, so how do you expect him to do that and why should he bear responsibility for that as well? GET A JOB! Sayed as the ex who's owed a lot of cash and knows how hard it is when a jerk doesn't pay what he owes. Are you my ex? If so, they're looking for you. Best of luck, Sue
1195	What difference would there make? Violent criminals would continue to be released back into society in order to accommodate nonviolent first offenders, such as deadbeat fathers, drunk drivers with multiple misdemeanor convictions (but no accidents), recreational marijuana users caught with just one joint in their possession, scam artists who prey on the wealthy, etc. Prisons should be for the long term confinement of the most dangerous criminals, robbers, rapists, and murderers, so that society is protected from these violent sociopaths.
1196	First of all, drugs are illegal, so punishment is there. If the accused was clean, he would have been in jail for 3 to 5 years and less time for good behavior. Yes, you are right, killing is a lot shorter than good behavior.
1197	What's their choice, is it doing what China tells them, or not offering anything for the people there?
1198	I agree with part of the previous answer, that children's cognitive development occurs during these years, and that's why some subjects aren't taught until children are older. Some children at the younger end don't know the difference between right and wrong, and can't even imagine what will happen or what will happen if they do something.
1199	First of all, Wal-Mart is the worst of all when it comes to the way they treat their employees. I've heard people boycott them and encouraged me to do the same. Why would Californians want to support a store that treats its workers badly? Why would it pay when the full-time workers are laid off, lose their pensions, go on Medicaid and use state-funded supplementary insurance schemes (I assume I'm from NY), and they have to deal with the stress and meaninglessness of being around such a place for so many hours a week? Why would they want to stay around at all when they have to deal with the resulting stress and meaninglessness of their anger and the meaninglessness of their existence?
1200	First of all, you get what you pay for, and secondly, if it seems too good to be true, then it probably is. I would ask the agent for a copy of the insurance policy, called a sample policy, and go over it very carefully. It will give you a clear idea of what you will and won't get under the insurance policy. If you are comfortable, then yes, you should take it.
1201	Well, it's not going away anytime soon, is it? In fact, there are arguments about the health risks, but regulated industry with check-ups and such would be safer than the drug and disease-ridden industry as it is now.
1202	I'm sympathetic to the death penalty, because I'm aware that if someone murdered a family member, I'd want them to be condemned to the ultimate penalty, but I'm also against it because of the risk that innocent people are being killed. People believe DNA is the killsafe, but it's not. Often, people convicted before DNA is used are unable to appeal against the execution of their DNA. I'm opposed to that, so that I or someone I know doesn't have to face the fate of the unknown number of innocent people who have been condemned to the ultimate penalty.
1203	It depends. I lost a friend to drugs a year ago. It was very sad. Drugs are psychological things. There are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness. For instance, many alcoholics have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorder. This is an example of peer pressure. No one wants to hear about a grown man acting like a girl. Society says, "hell no.. let's go out and drink.." The problem is that you cover one problem with another. Therapists will spend a lot of time dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compulsive use of drugs.
1204	Yes, if you catch them later, you'll lose your job, and you'll have to explain an even bigger gap in your employment history. If you want to stay outside, you must hide the crime behind an uninterrupted work history, so you can't afford to lose your job. Find a short-term job, if you must, and then find a more suitable one. Be faithful, though, especially in short-term jobs, because you really don't want to lose your reference. Good luck.
1205	You know, corporal punishment was used here before, crime rates were lower, but there were also a lot less people living here. I don't know if it's a good idea, but something must be done. Crime rates are out of hand.
1206	Not really, because you didn't fill out an accident report and your work will argue that you did it at home and you have no proof of doing it on the job. That's why even a minor injury should have been reported to your supervisor or you have no case. Did you tell anyone about your back hurting before you left work and if you did they have to sign an affidavit that you did hurt yourself on the job and you risked losing your job and possibly your job, so if you do hire a lawyer, you better be prepared for a long and fierce battle and you will lose your job. If you do hire a lawyer, you better be prepared for fighting a long and fierce battle and you will lose your job. If you do hire a lawyer, you better be prepared for fighting a long and fierce battle and you will lose your job.
1207	Dear Friend, I don't know if I agree with your question, but I think it's a systematic suspicion of certain minorities that is a crime. If insurance companies charge higher prices for black customers than white customers because they think black drivers are more at risk of accidents, I'm sure they'll be sued. But, anyway, law enforcement personnel carry and use weapons and handcuffs, send people to jail and prison, and can destroy the lives of innocent people who are just like any other. Insurance companies sell insurance that you can get from hundreds of competing companies. Discrimination in law enforcement matters a lot more than discrimination by insurance companies.
1208	It seems like it, but no. If he's a landlord, report him to the BBB and city for code violations. If he's got cops and law enforcement in his pocket, that's shameful! There's not much you can do. I would advise you to stay away from him if you can. A better idea: contact your local newspaper and expose him on national TV! They love to expose people like that. It's good for ratings and it would make him stop, hopefully, or at least lose his business licence, etc.
1209	You know, they can sue you even if they can't find you. Yes, they can sue you even if they can't find you. And they'll be able to publish the case in the paper where they think you are. So, if they can find your assets, like bank accounts, in the United States, they can take advantage of that. But if all your money is outside the country, actually, even outside the state where the lawsuit was brought, it's going to be a nightmare to get that money. And it will take a lot of time to get that judgment out of the country and then translate it, and that's going to be a mess. So, you're probably safe, not 100% sure, but around 87% safe.
1210	In a "diverse" community, race should not be an issue. There are no need to exclude people of different races, but they should not be forced into communities of one race in order to make it "diverse." There are also many differences in appearance and skin color in one race, which does not make it any more "diverse."
1211	Since it's illegal to offer equity in a startup via Kickstarter, what's the point of funding it? It's a kind of charitable donation to a company that doesn't make money, or it's a gambling game where you never get anything more than you put in, but it's quite likely that you won't get anything more than you put in.
1212	I think marijuana is stigmatised in society because it's socially acceptable to use drugs like alcohol and tobacco. In fact, many scientists think caffeine and sugar are safer than marijuana. This social stigmatisation is the sole reason marijuana is illegal and is not allowed to work in some states where it's legal.
1213	I understand the point of having someone accountable for disinformation, that's a good point. I guess I asked the wrong question though, because obviously, statistically, there will be more lies seen online than in publications just because it's easier to spread.
1214	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my opinion. I am aware that their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but that doesn't matter. It's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said, I don't want to see statistics on poverty, education levels, criminal levels, or how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positions of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how they are actually discriminated against.
1215	I'm aware that there are many religions, but I'm mainly talking about Christianity and Islam. I think morality should be like trading cards, you can change them whenever a new one comes along. I don't think that religion keeps people stuck in the views it has in its text. I think that without religion people would be much more willing to accept new views. For instance, Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. I'm aware that there is room for interpretation, but I think the world would be a better place if people made their own moral decisions rather than being dictated by their religion.
1216	I'd like to see humanity's ultimate goal to be PROMOTING COMPLEX SELF-ORGANIZING MAKEUP.
1217	I'm aware that there's no perfect news agency, but I think Fox News is a very biased news agency. Maybe it's because they're biased in a way that doesn't suit my views, but I still think that Fox News is a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. Am I right to think that Fox News is the lowest of news broadcasters, or am I wrong to think that they are biased against them?
1218	I must admit, I am a generally positive person, but sometimes I feel that the world is just a step away from catastrophe because of all the corruption, pollution of the environment, debt, inflation, overpopulation, oil, fading resources, climate change, etc.. I know it's a very difficult question, but I would like to have a little more hope in the future of the world and humanity. Please help me to change my mind.
1219	As a result, college is a place where you learn social skills as well as work related skills. Social interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is an experience that builds your self confidence, self reliance and valuable experience living independently from parents with people of a similar age. Going to a community college or four year university with very few students who live near/on campus, aka commuter campus, provides an inferior social education and graduates, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went to a more traditional four year university.
1220	If there is high unemployment in a country, as it is today in most western countries, why does it need to have more cheap labor? If the labour market does not grow, it creates more competition for fewer jobs, which encourages employers to employ the lowest skilled workers.
1221	If the government wishes to deny me the means of defending myself with a weapon, then it is my responsibility to defend myself. In my opinion, the government should be available to me within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my house, and I think that is sufficient time to survive as an unarmed person facing an armed intruder.
1222	The usual argument is that knowledge is usually collective (laws of physics, discoveries/inventions), so that the result of applying that knowledge should be humankind as a whole. However, I think that innovation, or the ability to exploit that knowledge for a completely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, where intellectual property laws are of vital importance.
1223	I think the killing of palestinians in Israel is taking the form of genocide. The number of victims on both sides is overwhelming, and it seems to me that they kill only on the basis of one criteria, and that is if the person is a palestinian. If Hamas uses their people as human shields as they say, it doesn't justify the destruction of their people.
1224	I understand that tattoos and piercings are not allowed in my work, from part-time to full-time, but I don't think it's a good idea to show them in the workplace because they're not supposed to be showing any negative image.
1225	Atheism is not a form of religion, so I do not need religious freedom as a non-believer.
1226	I've been hearing about this in the media, and I think it's a good idea to require people to show a photo ID in order to prove that they are the person they claim to be voting, and to prove that they are actually legal voting age. Anything else that you legally have to be of a certain age for, like car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, flying, etc., requires ID, so why not something as important as voting? Then again, some people say it's discriminatory, even comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crowe's laws. I don't think it's discriminatory, I think it's just a discriminatory thing to do.
1227	I think that the 12 hour clock is a relic of a time when we had better ways of measuring and observing time, and I don't see any benefit in continuing to use it.
1228	I honestly believe that fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation and its people, if it is done correctly with a competent and great leader, such as FDR. Of course, Hitler and Mussolini are not the ones to do this, but what about Hideki Tojo? He was a good leader, with the hopes of his people at his side, but he did not make the wrong decisions when it was time to give up, and even stopped causing blood to be shed when he saw the destruction of the Axis. And he did not make the wrong decisions when it was time to give up, and even stopped causing blood to be shed when he saw the destruction of the Axis. And what would have happened if Fascism had continued to exist, and had a competent and great leader, such as FDR, who would have been able to do so, in my opinion, and had a bright future.
1229	We see naked animals all the time, and it's common knowledge that most animals reproduce by sex. Most people survive encountering naked animals, or even animals having sex with no problems. People are basically high functioning animals, and the fact that nude beaches, nudist colonies, swingers clubs, porn shoots exist proves that nudity/sex in front of other people isn't dangerous or harmful to the parties not involved.
1230	**Employee** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?" **Employee** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then." **This argument is based on those who are only working for money, it doesn't matter if it's an apprenticeship or internship, etc.** **EDIT: There's no chance of promotion or raise in bar work, waiting or retail sales, these are the minimum wage jobs I'm talking about.**
1231	Do you agree or disagree, and why?
1232	I'd choose The Incredible Hulk, also known as Thoughtprocess' Mother, because he's so strong that he's unable to defeat anyone who dares to do so.
1233	Excuse me, I'm 17 years old, very athletic, I joined the army reserve recently, and I'm a straight A student who might occasionally get a B+, so I'm not retarded, which is a very rude thing to say, because retardation is an unfortunate thing that happens to anyone, and there are actual retards out there, and I'm going into my senior year of high school, so I haven't dropped out. And since I'm active and very athletic, I'm not a lazy fat ass. Thank you very much!
1234	The Dark Knight is a great epic, but Year One is more of a crime comic than a superhero story, where Batman fights corrupt cops and the mob with a few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli's realistic art fits the mood perfectly, Batman is more like an athlete than a bodybuilder in body paint, Miller's writing is more about vengeance than about morality.
1235	We should consider this. If there were terrorist groups in our country, wouldn't you want to help them? The same thing happens to Darfur. They want help, but they don't get it. And if we help them, it will make a good impression on the United States.
1236	I'm sure most people who say this have a very poor understanding or knowledge of American history. Moreover, it's impossible to assess a leader who hasn't even finished his term, and people don't even take history objectively.
1237	If you were wealthy, you could live whatever you wanted, take vacations, feed your interests and hobbies, and enjoy your life. If that wasn't enough for you, you could give a lot of money to the poor, and people would still like you. If you still had doubts about things, you could hire a coach and stuff to make you not feel that way, and your friends would make you feel better, especially if you used the money for a good cause.
1238	The consequences are fine, the punishments are justifiable, the sentences are made for real pedophiles, and the punishments for minors and the ones who are referred to as "no longer worthy" are justifiable, because they have chosen to act like these criminals, and they must learn a lesson.
1239	I'm Catholic, and I believe that killing innocent children should be against my religion. If an egg is fertilized, it is considered a child, and you should be sent to jail. If you know you cannot support your child, you should put it up for adoption.
1240	As a brief introduction to this debate, I will be arguing that we should kill one person, and that is my first and foremost argument: if you do not intentionally let other people die, you are effectively killing them. If you see a man drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you are effectively killing him. Deontology is wrong in its respect of human worth, and it says that all people have infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each individual person that is killed.
1241	The reason we kill is because we feel upset about our lives, frustrated by images of friends we'll never have, products we can't afford, and movies full of lives we'll never live, not because of video games, but because people are closer and more friendly.
1242	---Could we have someone take over IE? Opera is great, it's got all the good features of the browsers, but it's not recognized much. For instance, "Speed dial" is a feature that shows you the 9 most used bookmarks on the screen when you create a blank tab. It's also got a lot of add-ons, but its community is just starting. Besides, Opera was recently rated very highly by CPU Magazine, with its only weakness being its lack of add-ons, which is growing.
1243	"As a result, secular governments have killed more people than any religious war in history." The number of people killed is not a good measure of "badness," because the population is constantly increasing, so religious wars that killed half a group of people thousands of years ago might not have reached the same *number* of people killed in a modern war, even though the damage caused by such wars is far worse than that of the present war.
1244	Who's to say that teens can't fall in love, at least for a while.
1245	I don't know the story, I don't know the details, I don't know what the slap was, I don't know how heavy it was, I don't know what part of the body it was. I don't know if it was violent or threatening, but I think it's worth and important to do something about it, even if it means you could face serious legal consequences.
1246	We must admit that steroids were used in baseball for 20 years, starting in 1985 or so. Will some baseball records be distorted or altered because of this? Probably. But it's a ludicrous thing to let one person in the Hall of Fame because we don't think they used steroids, but not another because we think they used them.
1247	I don't think this debate has any moral value, because most MEDCs are looking for equality between men and women, and here we are looking at the fact that children choose who they want to live with, if their mother is mentally ill, then who will be their father one day.
1248	All right, I still love the food, but the service is terrible. For instance, I went there today with a small group and the place was not busy at 1pm. The servers were rude and they continued to treat us as inconveniences. When I went to pay, however, she was a bit snarky.
1249	We walked in here and they didn't acknowledge us for over five minutes, but the staff stared at us and knew we were here. They said it would take 10 minutes to wait, then said it would take 15 minutes. There were plenty of seats available, too. Very poor people skills, including the young lady Mrs.
1250	I'm always here if I'm around and craving some BBQ. It's my favorite place in the neighborhood near Gen and Hwaro. We always get the marinated beef and boneless ribs, as well as the steamed egg. And they always have a lot of sides. And when my friends have a little more stomach space, we always end up at Rolled Ice Cream afterwards!
1251	I haven't been disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service since my last review. I have tried many different dishes and always find them to be my favourite compared to anywhere else. I have had nice conversations with Steven, who I hope opens a branch in Peterborough, so that I can enjoy the food more often. I would recommend Chicken Pakora, Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and Goat Curry, but there are many other delicious options.
1252	I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews about this place, but it certainly wasn't our experience. We arrived at around 8:15pm and were seated immediately. The place was crowded and the server was very helpful. We ordered the two-for-$35 bbq platter and it was excellent. Ribs, chicken, pulled pork, tri tip, hot link and an array of sides. The tri tip, ribs and chicken were excellent and I never even touched the pulled pork. The drinks were quite expensive, but you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass for $8.50. That's a lot cheaper than the regular fountain drink at their store.
1253	I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times, and it's such an amazing dish and an art work. I've never tried it before and it was a dream come true.
1254	First of all, I was at Tim Horton's for breakfast and I heard good things. I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, lettuce, tomato) on a pretzel bagel. The bagel wasn't fresh, the eggs weren't very good, and my girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on a English muffin. It was tiny and it was a waste of food. We were already late and we needed to catch a train, so we just figured out that we lost.
1255	I don't think it's a good idea to dress like a school uniform, it makes you seem unattractive and you can't express yourself enough, so school uniform is fine.
1256	No comparison, FF's better for my use in every respect.
1257	Well, it's all pretty much dependent. Like if she killed someone who deserved it, it would still be scary to sleep with them, so this isn't a sure thing.
1258	No, I'm not sure she'd be like that if I did something like that, and she'd be right next to me, she wouldn't have said a word. And if she did murder, it would have been for a legitimate reason.
1259	Books are better than TV because they're cheaper to buy books if you want to buy a TV, it's really expensive and you need a license for it. You can learn a lot of things that TV is violent or not right for kids, so books are better.
1260	Books will always be great, no matter what new technological developments appear. They have a certain place in the heart of every human.
1261	I strongly believe that India cannot lead. You are talking about the 7th, 3rd, 2nd rank of India in the area of defence and arable land respectively, but this is the supreme power that cannot be relied upon in the 2nd or 3rd rank. Moreover, people are not busy, they do not have the time to think about the country's development, they are happy at home.
1262	Well, India is finding it hard to manage itself first, so there's no question of leading the world so far. But if we compare it with the present situation, let's see what we can see: 1. Nearly 90% of India is illiterate, so it's hard for an illiterate country to lead the world. 2. India is more interested in castes, politics, religions, and less interested in development. 3. The most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence in itself and is still cursing itself. So if it continues like this, it's hard or even impossible to say that "India will lead the world when it can't lead itself!"
1263	India has the potential to lead, because it is the world's second biggest army and its third biggest army. It is a country full of hopes and dreams, and we are proud that we are Indians and we will lead the world and become the King of the world.
1264	Being fatherless would have ensured that his absence would be the only pain you'd feel, and that you'd never know what he was like.
1265	I don't know why you should be a father, I mean, I don't know what it means to be a bad person. Parents should be role models for their children, not just lazy ones. What's the point of being a bad father for your entire life? You won't learn anything, so why keep him around?
1266	I've been without a father for so many years, but not having a father is so much better. It's been eighteen years since I saw my father, but if he doesn't care about me, he shouldn't be here.
1267	No, if you're looking for Farquhar, he didn't do anything for Singapore when Raffles was away, he just created a mess and let things like sex, crime, and gambling continue.
1268	Children used to be free to do as they pleased, to and from the candy shop, to and from school. Now there are child pornographers, online pornographers, and new crimes have been born.
1269	Even though humans have sexual desires, it doesn't mean that people you don't even know should watch pornographic movies with you.
1270	Oh, sorry, I meant the creationist version of evolution.
1271	I'll show you that human evolution has not taken place since the beginning of human history.
1272	It doesn't make much sense. Why do we still evolve and the monkeys don't? Why don't the fish jump from the water and grow legs? If that happened billions of years ago, why doesn't it happen today? Why can't we see psuedo-hybrid fish that grow legs, why doesn't evolution have stopped for a mysterious thousand years?
1273	You're 14 years old at school with me, that's funny.
1274	People sit on their butts all day playing video games when they need to burn some calories. So people who are overweight go outside and play football or something, while people who aren't overweight stop playing video games and get their energy back.
1275	I'm thinking we should have a gym, 'cause kids get fat and tubby! It's not okay for kids to get fat and tubby!
1276	Faquhar solved the problems of Singapore with cash from his pocket. When Singapore used to be plagued by rats and centipedes, he rewarded the people with coins for every pest they caught. This was a quick solution to the problem, as he had kept his promise.
1277	He had solved the problem by rewarding the people who killed these creatures.
1278	Farquhar had ordered his men to return to Malacca and bring back some food, while traders in Singapore had brought some of the necessities there.
1279	It is not your or anyone else's decision whether or not to abort. It is a ridiculous thing that people are being killed on both sides of this argument. It must be left alone.
1280	Her mother wanted him aborted, but apparently she should have let him.
1281	There's no need to argue, the entire scientific community agrees that evolution has taken place and continues to take place.
1282	Everyone has their own desires, and women are degraded by pornography, but it's their choice to go into business.
1283	According to a law professor at Northwestern University, the reason for the 85 percent decline in rapes over the past 25 years is easy access to pornography.
1284	If society respected pornography and its creators, there wouldn't be any argument that porn was degrading anyone. Similarly, if we were to criticize movie actors, the act of being an actor would be degrading.
1285	Some people say God is against porn, but we're not going to find out because the Bible doesn't mention porn because it didn't exist in the Bible. So how are we supposed to know that it's a sin?
1286	It is better to advance the common good than to pursue personal interests. The reason is that helping others is more important than focusing on oneself. We must improve the community first, before we focus on ourselves.
1287	It's better to do good for the common good, because as the Bible says, "Two are better than one, because they've got a good reward for their labor." For instance, football is a team sport, and everyone must trust one another, not just because there's no "I" in the team, but because there's no "I" in the team.
1288	I think that advancing common good is more important than personal interest, because most people tend to look out for themselves rather than for others. Looking out for yourself first, rather than looking out for others, isn't going to do much good in the long run.
1289	First, it's about equality, if children can dress as they wish, they're less equal with their peers in the classroom than with uniforms. Second, it's important to educate children, not how to dress, but maybe it matters at certain levels. Most people who go to schools where they don't have uniforms spend about 1 hour looking for their pants or shirts.
1290	It's a good idea, children should be equal, they shouldn't be comparing clothes, they should buy what they see as new from their classmates even though it's not necessary.
1291	It means you don't have to worry about what to wear, and it's less awkward when people say you have to dress like a schoolboy and you dress like a mufti.
1292	There's going to be less "Oh, you don't wear this and you wear that" in uniforms, and that makes it more pleasant. Two, you don't have to spend a whole lot of time deciding what you're going to wear and three, there's going to be less drama.
1293	I think it's a good thing to have a ludicrous father, rather than no father, because growing up without a father would have a great effect on your childhood, which would have made you wonder who your father was and what he was not good at or good at. And also, growing up without a ludicrous father, you wouldn't have been able to show your father that he was good at what he was good at.
1294	I'm fond of television because you can watch all the porn you want with your family.
1295	TV can be better than books, because it shows faces of characters, and it's difficult to decipher what's on the screen from a book.
1296	I don't say this because I love watching TV, but you get more information than you think you do.
1297	You can watch TV in one sitting, whereas books take a whole day to read. So you don't have to exercise your body when you read books. You can do exercise when you watch TV because it makes you move. TV is better than books.
1298	Go to TV, go to TV, hopefully, TV's going to win.
1299	Aquafina, Coke, Perrier, Nestle, and the other American water companies are Aquafina, Pepsi, Dasani, Coke, and Nestle.
1300	It would be a huge mistake to ban plastic bottles, which are purchased by over a million Americans every day and help the economy get out of the recession we are in. Maybe not in a big way, but every child that is helped counts! Plastic bottles make less than 1&#xof; the world's wastes and can be recycled!
1301	Why are you arguing with the United States of America when you're in Canada?
1302	Yes, if they continue to manage a positive and effective economic agenda. The first thing they need to do is promote their economic policies to investors and tourists.
1303	India's international institutes, like Nalandar, where students from all over the world come to study..........discovery of decimal and 0
1304	Indian culture and language were established a century ago, while other countries were finding their languags
1305	ndians have always been powerful, why are you forgetting their ancient glory days?
1306	I think India has the power to lead the world.
1307	I'm sorry to see how it turned out, not with much respect and too much spam. I choose atheism over Christianity, because there isn't enough evidence to quench my curiosity and Christianity raises too many questions that it doesn't answer.
1308	Not mymuse, give me one logical reason to believe in Christianity. Just one.
1309	It was just an excuse made to make people of simpler times not to think too hard about the big questions.
1310	Nobody's ever waged a war for atheism.
1311	I strongly agree that spanking children should be an option for disciplining them, because it is painful enough for children to learn not to do the wrong thing.
1312	Yes, because they must learn so that they remember that if they do something wrong, they'll be hit.
1313	It was like touching fire, to be honest, but it was all about parents and children. They could do their job, they couldn't, but abuse is never good.
1314	Christianity is trying to promote better morals and ethics, and atheism is not helping. It is merely a symptom of the harm that comes from believing that one should follow Christ's ways.
1315	I'm not a Christian or atheist, I'm a Moslem, that's the best religion.
1316	All this proves is that the Internet is full of atheists who are completely homophobic and intolerant of other people's beliefs and cannot let people be free to worship or not worship as they choose. They are simple bruts.
1317	Science confirms the existence of God, now all we have to do is decide which one.
1318	Christianity, 'cause I'm always supporting the underdog. Here, the atheists are much larger.
1319	Christianity offers hope to the world, and encourages others to assist the poor.
1320	God's helping those who help themselves! So I'm going to heal myself on the laptops of school, then God's helping me?
1321	I agree, if it gets to a point where you can lightly spank a child, but not to such an extent that you're beating the child.
1322	Because if a child is not aware of what is wrong and what is right, he needs to be taught what is wrong and what is right.
1323	I don't think it's supposed to be done just to punish a child. Parents could just scold their child so they'd stop what they were doing wrong. But hitting isn't the solution, because it hurts them physically as well, because they'd learn how to be afraid. They wouldn't do the wrong thing again next time, not because they'd learned their lesson, but because they were afraid of being hit.
1324	You shouldn't hit your child. You can give your child other penalties.
1325	I'd turn my wife in if she committed murder. I wouldn't want my wife to turn me in. I wouldn't have loved a murderer.
1326	I'm talking about the no snitching rule, but when it comes to murder, I don't think I'd do anything about it.
1327	I've always been in favor of life, and I believe that abortion should be forbidden.
1328	No one's got the right of telling you what you're doing with your bodies, but if the thing you're trying to remove disappears without you feeling it, then it's not yours, because it feels outside of you.
1329	Gays are human beings, just like us, and they should have the same rights as we do.
1330	The egg and spoon race is a terrible idea, and maybe we should have the royal family breed some more uinterbred children to fight. Imagine what it would be like if there weren't ewapons.
1331	I don't think it's charitable to give away your old clothes you don't want, and then expect a financial reward in return, i.e. a tax write-off. Do you even know what charity is?
1332	It would be a good idea to modify the requirements of the Constitution, so that you would still have to be 35 years old and have lived in the United States for 14 years, but you would change the natural-born citizen requirement so that you become a US citizen for 40 years. This would allow people whose parents move here when they are children, to know and know as much as any other child here. I think this is a good topic to discuss in your paper, and you could easily elaborate on it with examples.
1333	It seems you want to convict the cop before all facts are investigated. Remember, innocent men are proven guilty.
1334	You need a financial advisor, and it's a good thing, because you can invest the money instead of letting it sit in your bank account. If it's a testament, the court will most likely require a financial advisor. You don't have to tell the government, you don't have to pay taxes unless you want to, and really, there's nothing else you can do except cash the check, collect the money, invest it, and live. Don't get too excited and spend all your money at once, mind you, but spend wisely and leverage your money as best you can.
1335	You could give some to a good cause, a family struggling to make a living and going to work every day. An elderly person who lives on social security and cannot afford his electricity bill. You could give some to a children's hospital, an animal protection society or a retirement center in your area. There are many ways to use it. I hope you find what you are looking for.
1336	You need to hire a competent lawyer immediately if you do not already have one, because these cases are very complicated and have a lot of ramifications. For instance, a conviction for a drug offense can lead to a reduction or a lack of eligibility for federal student aid at college, if he decides to pursue this route. Even though it is illegal to give a person a drug that is not prescribed, there is always a need to discuss this with the prosecuting authorities. I recommend that you contact a competent criminal defense attorney in your area, who will be willing to accept a large retainer.
1337	Is it a ticket, what's on it? If it says you must appear in court, I wouldn't listen to the cop. If it says you must appear, just pay the fine or whatever it says on the ticket. Or ask your husband, he probably knows the lawyer in town and can get you out of this.
1338	Yes, prostitution should be legalised, let local governments decide whether they want to or not, and deal with it either through an Ordinance or zoning law. The same is true for drugs, which would allow governments to increase revenue for treatment and health care, and to remove a source of more violent criminal activity which supports these illegal trades.
1339	He's doing exactly what he must do, and he must make sure that taking this case on is a profitable business decision, meaning not only is it a good case that he can reasonably expect to win, but also that the profits involved will be sufficient to justify the time and expense involved. And if he declines to represent you, it doesn't necessarily mean that your case isn't worth pursuing in the first place, it just means that it doesn't make sense for him.
1340	If that person was "giving himself in", I'm sure he'd be accommodated. As you say, it's a lengthy process, but I assure you that if you were under oath and confessed to a crime, especially murder, then the court would be obliged to take the person into custody and begin the process of examining the paperwork. Anybody who testifies under oath that they committed a crime but didn't really commit the crime would be charged with perjury, which is punishable by whatever the state laws allow.
1341	And I've been paying taxes all these years, and we actually overpay, and then in spring we get a partial refund, which is always nice, to cover any credit card purchases we might have made for Christmas or a home improvement project. But many Americans end up paying more, because they didn't get enough deductions from their paychecks the previous year.
1342	You have plenty of choices when it comes to choosing words and it's a shame if you can't find them and start using fowl language. I advise you not to fear such animals and continue to share your knowledge with us.
1343	Is it legal to push your religion on people who do not believe in it?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
1344	Well, the third answer is that false imprisonment happens more than you think, especially in states that do not have the law on discovery, and in my opinion, they do not have those laws because they want to get rid of the poor and innocent and "falsely imprison" them. The southern states are good at that. As long as there is no discovery, the prosecution can hide facts that downright prove the accused person is innocent, and yes, they knowingly do this to enhance their conviction record to help further their careers, and the part that kills me is that not only are these poor people still able to sleep, but the law allows them to get away with it, and when it is, (usually)discoveries, years later, they cannot do anything to get back the freedom that was taken from them.
1345	Your chances aren't good if you go over his limit. Your lawyer might sue him, but it's not likely that you'll be able to get much. If he doesn't have a home or other property, he probably won't bother. He might check your personal auto insurance, which usually covers uninsured drivers if you have it, but he'll need to find out whether you can use it since you weren't driving at the time. And since you've got $170,000 in medical bills, I guess you don't have any personal health insurance either. Your lawyer should be able to tell you what you can expect to get after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending on the type of injury.
1346	It depends. Both are given for obvious and extreme crimes. But I'm not sure I'm talking about the legality, but the morality that no one has the right to take another person's life if they commit a crime. It's better if they spend the whole life in prison, being beaten up, or working.
1347	Obviously, there are criminals out there who do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it repeatedly. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those who are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be a decent citizen again.
1348	The United States cannot afford not to be friendly with China, a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer goods, etc., so we can afford to act like bullies, assert Monroe Doctrine supremacy over the hemisphere, and freeze the Cubans, hoping Castro, or, more likely, the guy who's coming after him, will fall from power and we can get back to being the pro-U.S. sugar and smoke satellite that it used to be for decades.
1349	You've missed the point. The freedom of the press doesn't apply to secret government sources who leak classified information.
1350	In this case, our constitutional right to privacy is definitely violated.
1351	Scott Peterson was a "everyman" as OJ, and like OJ, he killed his mother. Then again, it was just like watching Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott was just an average guy, and like most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is pregnant, his version of reality is out of control.
1352	I disagree. Firstly, the decision should be the people of Singapore, not outsiders. Secondly, the low crime rate in Singapore is directly due to the fact that the country does not tolerate those who wish to disrupt society. Singapore is a society that tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity, but it will not tolerate those who wish to destroy the society it has built.
1353	Be careful. If they really wanted to "defend marriage", they should repeal all divorce laws and make adultery a crime. That would "defend marriage" - except that half of Congress would be in jail.
1354	The notion of people having this *right* is ethical, and I support the idea that everyone has this right. But whether people actually have it depends on the laws of their country. China, for instance, has policies in place that restrict information that citizens can freely obtain. India has national rights organisations that are alert to protecting and preserving citizens' perceptions of their rights, including information. (1) Every country has a segment that restricts information and all the other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of the party, there are basically two groups: those who want to control and those who do not want to control.
1355	Sure, let's replace one form of discrimination with another good idea. Now, instead of pride in what they've accomplished, they'll always know they didn't have to work harder than everyone else because they were given positions. I don't like people who go to college with low test scores and GPA just because they're black, and they make money because of it. Congratulations, R.D., you've made me a racialist.
1356	Blame the sanitation workers who, instead of fighting for better wages, benefits, etc., blame the unions, blame the employers who have fallen for their ruse. Americans are stealing jobs from themselves.
1357	Marriage is a business, and a license makes it legal. It's there to protect women's interests in terms of their wealth and children's. It's a protection. If you don't plan on staying with someone, having children or creating a community of property, it's not necessary.
1358	No, any society that values the value of human life and promotes nonviolent solutions would be hypocrites to include floogging and capital punishment in its justice system. There is always a risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed under a flawed justice system. Whereas punishment is decided by mortals, there is a risk that harsher sentences will be imposed on the basis of prejudiciality.
1359	The Church tends to exonerate itself whenever it sees fit, whatever the circumstance. I don't see why it couldn't be any different. The idea that the Church is not flawed and Christ's body is something that it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since conception. If it shows fault, misjudgment, mismanagement, whatever the circumstance, can it see itself as Christ's body with all its faults, then yes, I think it exonerates itself.
1360	If you have the right lawyer, you can certainly do that. Racial remarks are a form of sexual harassment, and the company, the person, and the supervisor can be held responsible.
1361	I've been black all my life, and I've heard my mother and father say it, but I never really used it. Sometimes, by mistake, when people I'm around say it a lot, but I ALWAYS correct myself. I hate that word and its use. I think people use it because they fear saying something else and looking "corny." When I was in college, I suggested that people not say "ni99a, my brother" day, and it worked.
1362	Annie Red I'm not sure about religion and I'm a woman. I don't know why abortion should be allowed for any reason but to save the mother. Partial birth abortion is murder, by the way. Why do liberals think that conservatives are brainwashed into their beliefs?
1363	Money is not the cause of all evil, it is the cause of all evil because of love for money.
1364	It depends on the crime. In fact, if you've grown up enough to commit a serious crime, you need to spend your time in prison. If we continue to let youths get away with serious crimes, older criminals will continue to trouble our youth. We have to raise our children properly so that they're going to end up in jail, but there are some things that are morally wrong, no matter how old you are.
1365	If you have a lawyer, contact him immediately, if you do not have a lawyer, then contact the court. It is not a good idea to ignore this situation as others suggested, because your ex may have arranged for you to be served with documents that prove that you were properly served. You may have to request a continuance and prepare yourself for the hearing. If you do not attend the hearing, the court may issue a negative ruling against you that may be difficult to undo.
1366	I've been against some of the things that happened to Youtube, like the Google+ integration, but I can't see any downsides to it taking over Twitch.
1367	The government's right to say teenagers shouldn't drink, but obviously it shouldn't be 18. It's a complete insult to the 20th birthday, the dawn of a new decade, perhaps the most important of all.
1368	In the UK, every few years the government's "cabinet" is reshuffled and the minister responsible for education moves job to become minister responsible for transport. Surely it would be more sensible to have every few years elections where academic experts in every relevant field are competing for positions, rather than merely university professors.
1369	I don't mean that everyone is a poor person, but many have problems with their bodies or with their lives. But most poor Americans are content, and don't want to work, or go to college, or spend the time it takes to rise in society.
1370	My school's got a policy that if there's a threat of a bomb, the whole school is forced to converge at the stadium and wait for the cops and the bomb squad to arrive. But a smart terrorist, or someone who knows what they're doing, would easily find out and set a bomb in the stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It'd be better if I just got into my car and escaped. It'd be worth saving my life 100%.
1371	Why are so many people okay with this, are they just not aware of the mechanism of this political machine?
1372	Many arguments are about how parity can be maintained or enhanced, but I don't understand why anyone cares. The most interesting moments and periods in sports come when a handful of titans are able to escape, not a mediocre field where nobody can succeed.
1373	I understand that it's kind of considerate, but the equivalent of putting the seat back after use is never placed on the desk, and even if it is, it's just a bloat on the whole thing. And in a large building or household, the next person using the toilet might be a man and he needs to pee, so he's going to need to put the seat back again. And why would a man use a shared toilet without looking before he uses it, expecting that he's going to be doing the same thing as the woman?
1374	I'm always hearing people talk about how the death penalty should be used more often, but I don't know if it's a form of social retaliation, as in the way when a person's head was put on a pike, or if it's a form of retribution. If that's the case, why don't we want as many people as possible to see what happens when a person is sentenced to death? At least we can give the public a taste of what execution in the United States is really like.
1375	Basically, I think that the public has a right to know about stabbings, robberies, etc., but should not disclose the names of the culprits unless it is a matter of safety. In particular, I believe that the announcement of the names of the culprits in a murder/suicide case encourages other criminals to commit similar crimes in order to get the public's attention.
1376	CMV: At this early stage in the evolution of climate science, we don't know enough about life in the 21st century to predict what life will be like in 2050, and until that picture becomes more and more clear, we should act much more pessimist.
1377	It's not that it's feminine for a man to do it, it's just that it's not sexual at all.
1378	I'm a really young man (19) and I'm thinking of having rhinoplasty, chin, jaw and cheek augmentation. I don't want to be called ugly, but I'm pretty average. I think once I get the surgery, I'll be much more attractive and I'll be able to approach girls, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face and a strong body I'm going to build, will help me get into modeling, which is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel.
1379	Get over here, the most overrated saying from the desert dweller.
1380	I'm afraid we live in a safer time than ever, and the odds of being a victim of a violent crime are lower than ever. But on the flip side, the power of the Internet allows us to know about every single violent crime that happens anywhere on earth at any moment. And, of course, we have to teach our children not to commit rape.
1381	I've been 30 years old, and I think we've been "at war" with al qaeda/terrorism through military adventurism, nation building, and shifting huge sums of GDP into military contractors at the expense of helping our own citizens. It seems to me that the military industrial complex used September 11th as an excuse for war, because there will always be a war against terrorists.
1382	I'm a casual smoker, I buy a pack about 5 times a year when I'm stressed out. Am I fooling myself by thinking American Spirits aren't so bad because they don't have additives?
1383	I've been to four methods of education, and I understand that some classes are needed, but not all. Schools shouldn't use the same routines for every student, and some students don't want to be taught anything but the one they want to be in. In addition, economics should be the main subject.
1384	I've been through the Illinois Court System, and I've learned that getting what you want legally depends a lot on who you know, and it's all about connections.
1385	Europe Physical geography is not a continent, it's a cultural one. Some might argue that the Ural Mountains are a barrier from a satellite view, but there are no such distinctions on other continents. Continents are divided by huge oceans and seas. Powerful Europeans did not want to associate themselves with Asia and wanted to consider themselves as their own physical continent.
1386	It would be a catastrophe and a catastrophe to have our president imprisoned in this state in our nation's history. We must not forget that President Obama is not the first to have put us in such a bad economic condition, but if he continues to improve the economy, it is possible that we can get back on our feet.
1387	You cannot, at least in America, legally tell people what they can and shouldn't read,write or listen to, unless it's directly harmful to others. For instance, if you read,write or listen to a direct order to kill an innocent person and intend to follow that order, it's illegal. You certainly don't have a right to say what you see in your home away from you and impressionable minds in society.
1388	If we could create another being capable of being a sentient being, it would not be equal to us, no matter how smart, until it had achieved the same things as we, including creating more sentient beings. If it had done so, it would have had to do so at the same rate, otherwise it would have been greater than us, or even less than us, if it had been faster, or even more inferior, if it had been faster, or even less intelligent.
1389	Everyone has their own opinion, but with this kind of evidence, I think Kurt Cobain was murdered.
1390	I think that (that) she said is better because your mother is just your mother and (that) she hasn't been around as much as your mother, but it's still very clever. (That) she said is compatible with everything and can be used for a good laugh every once in a while and it's a joke. Compared to your mother, it's more insulting to your mother. There is a TV show called "Yo Mama" on MTV, which has a lot of old people making silly jokes about their mothers and they're all different, but it's better than "Yo Mama" and it's more entertaining than that.
1391	The US can't do anything against China, and any action you take against them can be counteracted.
1392	Everybody has the right to express himself, to be open and to express himself loud, logical or not. You also have the right to listen to him, to come back with your own ideas and opinions or simply not to listen to him, as if he did not exist, of course, if his ideas were not logical or acceptable.
1393	Pascal's wager isn't the most convincing argument for Christianity, in fact, I wouldn't call it an argument at all. It's logically correct, but it doesn't give any good reasons for belief. But it persuaded some people to believe. If Christianity is true, and man operates on that basis, then Pascal's wager is fine. It's a good bet, but it's gambling. But I wouldn't be using Pascal's wager.
1394	Euthanasia should be available to those who want it, because it provides a way to end suffering without pain for the patient and his family. Euthanasia can be a way to end suffering, rather than wake up each morning thinking that tomorrow you won't be alive.
1395	Trapper was a pretender, a fool who escaped while the game was on. While he was back in the States, starting his private practice, BJ was with Hawkeye until the end. As the war dragged on, and Hawk was beginning to lose it, did Trapper call to see how things were going? No, but BJ was entertaining his comrades with movies of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over the operation while Trapper was watching chickens on the bus.
1396	I've learned from the "convinceme" debates that the unborn have no heartbeat and their DNA is distinct from their mother's. The fact that the unborn may have a distinct blood type from their mother, but their DNA is unique and their cells are all replicating and living, doesn't make them human.
1397	I'm not sure what the device or procedure is, but you wear a device in your ear that picks up sound, and it sends it to a device that is inserted into your brain, and it takes months for your brain to learn the sound, but a lot of people who have hearing problems have had this surgery.
1398	The debate is based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence for creationism, while there is a lot for evolution. There are many ancient stories that support creationism, but none of them are confirmed by reliable evidence. Nevertheless, they were told by ancient peoples who had a much less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world.
1399	The Cold War is over, the Berlin Wall is no longer there, we trade with China and other socialist, communist and dictatorship countries. There are many US bases and companies that want to trade with Cuba, which will help open Cuban society as US business takes over the island and tourism increases.
1400	Yes, I think it's a bit much, and I don't think it's appropriate to sing it in schools. School is supposed to be an objective learning environment, so it doesn't make sense to introduce peer-reinforced patriotism and religious bias. It's a bit like indoctrination, to me, when I was in primary school, and it seems a bit like indoctrination. I support, at the very least, removing religious references to accommodate all religions and backgrounds. The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any atheistic references either). In addition, I think it's appropriate to leave the question of patriotism to students and parents outside of school.
1401	I think the worst problem might be that debaters spend a lot of time debating trivial things, like misspellings, and so forth. We're all guilty of it, don't we?
1402	Jon Stewart's got a much more sophisticated sense of humor, and he's got more important topics to talk about. He's got great interviews, and the reporters he's got are great, too. He's got bonus points for being the first, and he's not as funny as Stewart is.
1403	Yes, say you get your news from "fox news" and no other source, they make the wrong statements (such as describing a Democrat sexual predator as a Democrat), and they never correct them. You now believe that the Democrat is a Democrat, your reality has been altered, but that's just a factual reality that can be easily remedied.
1404	I've visited this location four times since it opened, and the staff has always been courteous and cheerful, the chicken has been fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits have been perfect, and the rice has been excellent. I've even tried the Cajun tenders, and unlike most places where the chicken is as much seasoning as the box it's delivered in, the tenders here have some real kick. I'm taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and I'm thinking of picking up a large box of o'bird for the teachers.
1405	I was on a business trip to Phoenix and decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The hostess was very unfriendly and seemed to be eager to get home. When I sat down at the table, a few of the bugs fell on the table from the lampshade overhead. The chips were greasy, the margaritas were sugary and the enchiladas were not very good. I was sick of food poisoning and spent the night running to the bathroom. You couldn't pay me to come back.
1406	I was not only disappointed in the food but also in the service. They were waiting for over forty minutes and their plane was taking off so they started yelling "JUST GIVE ME WHAT YOU GOT!" That's when I realized I should have gone elsewhere. I ordered the ruby burger and realized I might have missed ordered because I realized there wasn't any cheese on it. Please, put some mayo on it and don't overcook it. It was so disgusting I only ate most of it because I paid for it and I was hungry. The fries were nothing special. I wanted to go to Burger King but the gate was closed. I will never go back there again.
1407	My husband and I went to celebrate his promotion with excellent service and food. My waitress was patient and attentive, while she read the menu to her visually impaired client.
1408	We had a pizza in Naples and it was the closest we could get to the United States, the sauce was great, the place was very nice and the staff was very nice. We will definitely come back!
1409	This place isn't 5 stars, but it could be 5 stars if the management reads these reviews.
1410	It's just a typical Greek restaurant, Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth, and if you want a traditional chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, salad, rice and tzaziki, then go for it. The food is consistently good, and Panos is a reliable place in a world of mystery meat.
1411	It's just a experience, I don't know about you, but all the kids at my high school are trying to get a petition signed in support of uniforms.
1412	The fact that school uniforms restrict children's individuality is also a reason to oppose the uniform code in schools, which in turn restricts the spirit of unity among divergent cultures and their celebration.
1413	Kids don't want to dress the same every day, I know I'd hate that.
1414	Personally, I don't think school uniforms are a good idea. We are always told to be ourselves and express who we really are, but it's not possible when we're wearing a stupid uniform to school.
1415	I don't think it's a good idea to keep restrictions because it will only make students, especially teenagers, more hungry for fashion. It's better to feed them than keep them hungry. And when they get out of these restrictions, we will see another side of them, which is far worse than without morals. Allow people to be free with their personalities rather than stop them.
1416	I'd call you a fanatical zealot if you were an apple fan.
1417	It's better than Internet Explorer because it warns you that it's blocked pop-ups, and it automatically updates its older version with the new one, and it's very fast to download.
1418	When running multiple tabs, Internet Explorer wastes a lot of memory, and probably more than Firefox. And probably more. It could start a lot of SVCHOST.exe instances and use them as blinds.
1419	I'm just saying, "Don't tell your wife about killing somebody, they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, get them out of here before you turn yourself in!"
1420	While television has its advantages, I believe books are better for learning, as they require more concentration.
1421	Television's almost the same as a book, the only difference is that you have to look at the book with your eyes.
1422	The British used to wear red uniforms when they fought for independence, and every time they saw a British soldier they would shout, "The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming." If India had attempted to takeover the United States, the Americans would have to shout, "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming."
1423	I'd rather not have a father, because I'd rather not have a careless and uncaring father in my life. I wouldn't have looked up at him, and he doesn't necessarily have to be the kind of father I should have looked up to.
1424	I'd rather be "fatherless" than a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the household manager and give a good example so that the rest of the family can admire him. But if I don't have a father, I'll set the standard for myself and rise to be the household manager, especially if I have younger brothers or sisters.
1425	I think it's better not to have a bad father than to have a bad father.
1426	The treaty was signed by Raffles, not Farquhar, and Farquhar was just a subordinate.
1427	The Singapore Treaty was signed by Raffles, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong, with the commander on board the accompanying seven ships.
1428	Now, let me know what evolution believers are saying. How is it that evolution is real and humankind is not evolving right now? And how is Adam and Eve the earliest humans to have come to this planet, the 'parents' of humanity? And what is Arabic for 'bani adam', which literally means 'the tribe of adam'.
1429	I'm using Firefox, though, because I don't wanna transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it default browser.
1430	Kids are fat these days, p.e. helps one and one and it helps them realize that health is important for their pathetic future.
1431	I think it should be mandatory. Kids playing in the streets are usually overweight because they eat too much and do not exercise enough.
1432	Farquhar had done all the work for Singapore's improvement, but Raffles had only dreamed of what he should do.
1433	Singapore would have died without William Farquhar, but it had survived because he had been there to rule the country. Raffles had gone to govern another country.
1434	You don't know the stories of these girls, who are you supposed to judge what they can or couldn't do? Until you've been in their shoes for a mile, then you'll have the opportunity to speak for them. Until then, you don't have to like it, but you can stand by your opinion, but at least you have the courage to respect other people's opinions.
1435	You can actually see evolution taking place, because fruit flies are very useful in this experiment, because they breed, live, and die very quickly. You must understand that evolution is caused by mutations, and they survive because they have made it easier for the creature to survive than the others, i.e. natural selection.
1436	Were we created by a couple of days, or a result processed over billions of years? Which was more realistic? Which was more likely?
1437	You see, evolution cannot fail to occur, the weak die, the strong continue to reproduce, this reinforces the species. Argument over. But creationism and evolution are not exclusive, I do not believe in a god simply because there is a very slight chance that a god (or gods) exists.
1438	I'm betting you're a virgin when you argue that porn is wrong.
1439	It's not wrong to have porn, but it's not right.
1440	It is a better thing to do than to pursue personal interests, for example, those who wish to assist others, but who are only interested in themselves. Personal interests are, however, only for those who care only about themselves.
1441	I'd say advancing the common good is more important, because it helps the community, but personal interest is more important, because I'm aware that if I don't go to college after high school, I'm not going to go at all. So I'll choose my personal interest.
1442	I think it's the best way of moving forward for the common good, but it doesn't exist in this world. Usually people are greedy, selfish, and care only about what they want, and not about what others would want.
1443	I'd say it's a good thing, but it's not going to be perfect. I went to school in uniform, and it was a lot less stressful than college, which didn't have uniforms. It's a leveler, it's preventing people from showcasing their wealth, and it makes others feel bad about not having the things that they do not have. But it can get out of hand a little. For example, we didn't get to wear colored socks at the end, which was ridiculous.
1444	It is right to obey the correct rules in school, and the right to express emotions is right, but it is not necessary since we have come to school to learn.
1445	It's true that uniforms are good, and in schools they should be uniforms. You don't have to worry about what to wear every morning, and you'll be doing something important for your lessons.
1446	This policy is a good idea, because uniforms make students equal in terms of economics, which prevents envy and jealousy.
1447	It would be better if you had a bad father, because you could see his mistakes and avoid them. It would also be hard for you and your mother, because you would not have any role models or any kind of role models. At least you had a father who could help you when you needed help.
1448	I think it's a good thing to have a bad father, because I know what it's like not having a father, so it's a good thing to have a bad father than not have a father at all.
1449	Construction and maintenance of safe public water systems cost money, waste and diverted public health attention.
1450	Water bottles are bad, because they pollute the water, and they sell water battles with bacteria on it, depending on where they get the water. They cost more than tap water, and the water system is deteriorating and there are still hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.
1451	Can people say that some things on TV are better than books, because we're having a debate at school, can you please help me?
1452	When we're in a recession, why would we ban a product that sells to over a million people?
1453	He's drinking bottled water when the world's most interesting man doesn't drink Dos equis.
1454	I'm not sure about you, but water bottles are very convenient for me when I'm on the beach on a hot summer's day and I'm dehydrated and I can't get any water because of the ocean. I have two choices: pass out from heat and lack of water and waste the rest of my day sick or in hospital.
1455	I'm sorry, I put the last comment on the wrong side.
1456	It's wrong, of course. Why do you think there's an AIDS epidemic?
1457	Is marriage just about love, or is it about family, law, family, generation, example, commitment, tax breaks, parental roles?
1458	Or is it the case that homosexual _sex_ is helping to spread AIDS, in which case gay marriage might be helpful?
1459	I did not propose "separate but equal," I proposed "distinct and different." In fact, if the law is to consider man and woman relationships intelligently, it must be capable of separating them from each other. The law requiring separate schools and public accommodation for homosexuals would violate "separate but equal," but the law defining marriage as a man and woman union does not.
1460	Yes, India has the potential to lead the world if its government can look after a country of 28 states, languages, culture, geography and geography.
1461	I'm a Christian, and I'm very religious, but if the description of this argument is the criterion for determining whether or not a person is a Christian, I'll go with Atheism. God isn't a Christian.
1462	If God loves everybody, why does he hate homosexuals, and the Bible's just a book, have you ever wondered why the cardinal who translated it changed some things so that "God" looked nice?
1463	I made sure I didn't do it again after the spanking, so I wouldn't get hurt, because the second time it's always worse because you were told not to.
1464	I think parents should use spanking as a means of disciplining, but there's also a limit to that, so they shouldn't use it every time a child does something wrong.
1465	As I'm atheist, I'm sure I'm not forgetting the principles and standards of Christianity. As this debate heats up, it's better to conclude that the atheism trend hasn't really gained much ground, and it would be odd to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
1466	You'd rather die believing in a god than not believe and discover that he exists!
1467	'Cause spanking is mostly about anger, and it can be about something other than what your kid did, like if someone else made them mad, they let it out.
1468	I don't think parents should spank, 'cause there's no other way of making them behave.
1469	It is unnecessary and quite unrelated to the development of a child into an adult. Children who grow up with spankings and become terrible adults, while children who grow up without spankings and become fine or even great adults.
1470	Is that right? You stole a candy bar from school, your parents stole your favorite toy. You were disciplined for that, then you got a toy stolen.
1471	I'd be willing to bring them in, 'cause it's crazy. Whoever does it will be punished for the crime, I don't care who you are to me or what you mean to me. I'd be willing to bring you in.
1472	Yes, if a person I loved and lived with murdered someone, I would definitely bring them to justice. It's premedicated and planned, so you never know when they'll turn against you later.
1473	I'd confess to my wife, because it was wrong to kill someone, but it was still wrong, and in addition, the police would find out who killed it, but I don't want her to be left for a long time, so I would have told her, but I wouldn't.
1474	I've seen many COPS and Cold Case Files episodes, and the person who always seems to be involved in murders or as an accomplice is always caught. I don't wanna be one of those people. And if my wife murdered someone, she'd be too insane for me, so I'd break up with her.
1475	I'd say I'd probably turn my husband in, 'cause he's not who I wanted to be married to, and if he killed somebody else, who knows what his next attack will be on me? Obviously, if he killed somebody else, I don't want to spend the rest of my life with him.
1476	Sport shouldn't be compulsory for kids, because they're bigger than the rest of them or they're not fit enough. Bullies pick their victims every day at school, so all the guys on the affirmative team are wrong.
1477	I'm at school and P.E. makes kids unhappy, many people feel bad because they're selected last, they can't play. For example, I don't like P.E. class, I don't like it, and I'm always the last one selected for teams, and it's not nice. And not just obese kids, there are many obese adults who did P.E. and didn't do anything.
1478	P.E. should be optional for 8th grade, if students want to participate, but that's not the case. However, 8th grade students have a lot on their plate and that time could be better spent on studying.
1479	This restriction is intended to reduce the number of unintelligent jokes so that we can maintain the highest quality of debate and discussion.
1480	It's just too tiring, so that's why physical education shouldn't be compulsory.The minimum length of an argument is 50 characters, so that we can avoid the usual dumb jokes so that we can maintain the highest quality of debate and discussion.
1481	Some children simply cannot take pe. 4 For instance, some are already in athletics and are still training as if they're mad.
1482	I don't like the idea of increasing the P.E. requirement. First of all, I believe that students should be responsible for choosing whether or not to exercise. Second, I believe that college is a place where we learn our brains, not our bodies. Thirdly, I think there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement at college.
1483	Personal pursuits are better, because it's easier to help yourself than it is to help others. And people don't all want to be helped. People need to help themselves first, and that's what personal pursuits are all about.
1484	In my opinion, if you don't help yourself, you can't help anyone else. If you try to help everyone who needs your help, it just slows you down. Don't be mistaken, helping people is always right.
1485	I'm convinced that human nature is to pursue things for oneself, not others.
1486	The person who threw the cup away should not have a leg to stand on unless the person who helped roll the rim down had an agreement with the person who found it. If your neighbor asked you to drive him to the gas station to buy beer, cigarettes and lottery tickets, would you have earned half of the winnings, no, then I would have to say the finder deserves the prize.
1487	Look, you can get the hospital bills paid off completely, all you have to do is write a letter stating that you cannot afford the bill and most hospitals have to clear the account. That's all, but not all of them will. But it's worth it if you can afford it. My father just died and he didn't have a toilet in his house, and when I went to the show, they said they'd try and get me some toilet paper, but they didn't. Because most states will give you so much money that you can lay them down, and if you look into it more, they will give you $600,000 for his funeral.
1488	You're right, Christians are supposed to forgive; but you shouldn't suffer because of the wrong decisions of others. If you're planning to sue, you should only sue for the exact amount of medical bills and lost income. You have the right to that amount, so be sure to get the receipts. It's not unethical to sue for the exact amount of compensation, not for greed.
1489	Yes, if you feel he is doing more harm than good by being involved in her life, you have the right to request sole custody. This may be difficult to prove, especially if there is no court order in place regarding visitation. In my opinion, the judge would order specific dates for visitation first, and if he did not comply with those dates, he would be presumed to have given up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. This may take some time. On child support, it is certain that he will be subject to back child support from the day he was born unless he can prove he was paying. You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filling out forms for child support payments and custody. It is not hard to fill out, and they will assist you in doing so. The more information you have on your father, the better.
1490	Yes, the effects of "weed" are far less than the effects of alcohol, if legalized, it would open up a lot of room in prisons where they are placed for non-violent crimes, and I think it would encourage a lot of people to use harder drugs, and people needing it for medical reasons would not have to go through all the crap that they need now for relief!!!
1491	I don't know if I understand your question, but petitions are legal. You can make a petition on almost anything, and get a lot of people willing to sign it. But, a petition is not a real "legal document" in and of itself. It's just a list of people who want to act in their favor.
1492	No, God never said that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. But Jesus said, "You are as guilty of adultery as if you were having sex with her. You can lust after her naked or not, but any honest man will tell you that it's much easier to lust after a naked woman than a dressed one." So, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea.
1493	Ethically, if your father's insurance increases, you should pay it. It's probably going to be reviewed in six months. But the good thing is that it's just a lesson learned. You got a ticket for improper driving, no problem. She got a ticket because she was half to blame. Let's assume that there's a big medical bill. You're probably insured on your father's insurance policy, but if you were at fault, he wouldn't have been insured. Your friend has the problem, and he's not insured because he didn't put you in the car, and he might have to pay it out of his pocket. It's his problem, not yours. I don't think it's an ethical problem, because you're insured.
1494	Wow, that must have hurt you a lot. I don't imagine that you're holding back someone you love, but I don't think you are. If he wasn't worried, I wouldn't be either. It sounds like his boss needs to get over it and realize that homosexuals, interracial couples, lesbians and most relationships are common. I'm sure if he keeps pushing his boyfriend, he'll decide to look for another firm rather than lose you. Good luck.
1495	I've just attended a lecture yesterday on these statistics, and I'm sure you know what they are. Our crime rate is falling, but our incarceration rate is rising. This is due to the fact that the United States started a "war on crime" and the "war on drugs" in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Reagan in particular. It's because we're taking action and using incarceration as a solution. To really analyse these numbers properly, you need to take into account the crime rates of all these countries, which we score very badly, there, so you're right.
1496	You don't have to record your FSTs, and since most departments don't have cameras in the cars, I don't think they "forgot" to record your FSTs. You have your license, and the cops will testify that you were drunk.
1497	I'm sorry to say that this isn't a good legal ground for a lawsuit. You're not going to find a lawyer willing to take on this kind of case, so if you really want to pursue this, you're going to have to pay for it out of pocket, which is going to be astronomically expensive. If you really want to pursue this, you're going to have to talk to the guy, his boss, etc., and then you can just let it go.
1498	Dear Friend, they don't have any interest in your account if you're still alive. They're just taking your assets when you die, they're not responsible for any liabilities, certainly not while you're alive. Let them know that you'll get a lawyer if they don't change their mind, and that it'll cost them more than $800. Bank stealing money from innocent children? Most judges and juries around the world would eat that.
1499	It's very difficult to get sole custody, you need to prove that the mother is unsuitable and is harming the child. It's a shame she's in jail, but since she's in jail she can't do anything bad.
1500	I'm sorry to hear of your tragedy. It seems your neighbor's son is in a serious condition that needs immediate attention. If he is evaluated by a specialist and his results are normal, you can be charged for simple damages, but if not, you can still be charged because the parents of an ill child are responsible for all intentional damages they have caused. I suggest you talk to the chief of the police station, explain what happened and what you would like to do. If that doesn't help, then go further up the ladder until you solve the problem. Bullying has no excuse.
1501	If you've bought a dog in Florida and you've spent over a year here together or apart, then the courts of Florida will have jurisdiction. You can hire a lawyer to file your claim here and send it to Cali. If you registered the dog under your name, I don't see a problem with you bringing the dog back. Good luck.
1502	I'm also in favor of lowering the drinking age to 18. I'm 31, mother of two girls, and health teacher. I'd definitely vote for it back.
1503	I'm not sure if you mean Latinos as a whole or just one group. I know that Spanish is their mother tongue, so when they moved to English they might have a similar accent.
1504	The only problem with this kind of punishment is that it doesn't remove the criminal's will, he'll still have the same thoughts. Perhaps a combination of frontal lobotomy and castration will do the trick, but I don't see any state enacting this. I'm more inclined to favor the two strikes and your shooting method, and in addition, bullets are a lot cheaper than surgery.
1505	Wow, that's a lot of work. Is it your job to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you think of it yourself?
1506	The bad thing is, there are still a lot of innocent people who are looking for work, looking for jobs that our state doesn't have because of the high crime and unemployment rates, and have no place to live.
1507	I don't know if there's any actual statistics on this, but I think people lie in court all the time. People are either honest or dishonest. I don't think that swearing to tell the truth will automatically make a dishonest person want to tell the truth. It just means that if they don't tell the truth when they swear, it's illegal. And hey, if they're on trial for something illegal, it probably won't bother them if they do something illegal.
1508	Yes, fight for your rights, don't let him have any sex, just kidding, I must have said that at the moment. The most important thing is that the children are happy, and remember, documentation, documentation, I hope you have documentation of everything that happened in your life, witnesses, that he must have paid child support, regardless of whether he is a father or not, and he must support them. And don't question whether you need financial help, you do, and you deserve it. Good luck, I hope you and your children are doing fine.
1509	I think that when you get to a point where you can't move, or do something, or have a very hard time doing it, you are too fat. My father weighs 600 pounds and he can't even walk anymore, but it's not a crime, because it's one of the seven deadly sins in the Bible known as glutiny, and no one else can be held responsible for it. Because even if someone else is feeding them, they need to eat until they're full, or they won't be able to rest at all.
1510	If I walk into my house and my only child is lying dead on the floor, and I discover that the killer has just attacked my beautiful wife, and he cuts his knife and tells me he's giving up because I have a gun. Why should it be any different if he's been shot several months later?
1511	This is not an easy question to answer, since there is no simple answer in most States. For instance, the use of "reasonable force" in disciplining a minor child is justified in the event that the older child is in danger of serious injury to the younger child, rather than the fact that the older child is simply late for dinner.
1512	Why don't we legalize murder, extortion, robbery, rape, and use of marijuana? It's not right that millions of people around the world supported the 911 attacks, is it?
1513	Well, you know,I don't know everything,but I think people these days are too busy to see what's happening in the world. I don't know everything,but I think people are stupid to just watch Bushy (please don't sue me because I just called him Bushy instead of Bush,I just like that name)doing here. And,you know,people are sometimes too poor to buy TV sets or even newspapers,or they're just too lazy, too, because of taxes, gas prices,and all their stupid friends. And,you know,I don't like what I just wrote,but I'm sure you don't like it,but I'm sure you do!
1514	Pro. The fact that the murderer is executed means that he will never get away from it, nor will he hurt anybody else. It hurts the hearts and minds of the victims' families that their loved ones will never get another holiday, birthday or even one more day, while the murderer is still alive. It's just right.
1515	You should ask yourself, "Why is it that every country that enforces a ban on guns has an increase in crimes and burglaries?" Or, "Since some countries have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why haven't their governments reinstated their right to possess them so that citizens can defend themselves?" And how is that more diplomatic and more open to intelligent discussion than asking questions about the issue?
1516	I've tried to limit my answer to things that an individual can do, rather than organizing a counterdemonstration and other things that require a lot of people and money. Thank you for your thoughtful question.
1517	I still don't know why smoking is banned in public places, restaurants and bars. Non smokers have their own non smoking areas with fans, isn't that enough? I guess not. People just want to dictate what other people do to get their way. If a non smoker's right was apparently violated, they would and did get their way. But what about smokers' rights?
1518	I think it's because the whole un is against the war, Bush made this stupid, meaningless war, it was an unnecessary war, completely! Maybe that's why the world is watching, to see what mess we have created and how we are trying to fix it. But Bush will never admit it was a terrible mistake to go there and start this war, but maybe he will on his death bed. I do agree though, that the insurgents and terrorists would be eliminated if everyone helped.
1519	If someone wants to be a racialist, then let him be a racialist. There are worse things a person could be.
1520	If you want to sue a bar because you were arrested for public intoxication, what did they do? Hold you down and pour tequila all over your throat and make you a jerk? I'd love to sit on that jury one day.
1521	I think it's appropriate in certain circumstances. For instance, if what someone does has an adverse effect on another person or group, it should be possible to intervene. The government works for society as a whole, not each individual. We have certain freedoms and freedom to do whatever we like, but there are limits to that. If it's the best way of protecting society by restricting one person's freedom, it should be able to do so.
1522	I'm not sure what to make of this decade, but I find that there's not much to be positive about. For instance, everyone is always looking at their phone. I can't even enjoy myself when I go to a concert because everyone has their phone in the air to record the show. They ruin every social situation I can think of.
1523	In practical terms, our basic needs are essentially food and water. Social hierarchies are not necessary for the existence of hunters and gatherers, but they are there to make our lives meaningful.
1524	I don't know why people with degrees in history study do things like that, but it's just for our amusement.
1525	It might end up being a Dodge Charger or a Crown Victoria, with roof racks like their siren lights, spotlights on the driver's side, ram cages on the front and maybe even numbers on the rear and maybe even the side. I don't think it's too far to write something like "Police" on the side, but I'm sure I can hit it. We don't live in a dangerous area and we never plan on being anywhere near one, so I don't see him taunting Fuck-The-Police types. I think he's going to intimidate everybody he goes into, and people are going to drive carefully and slowly around him.
1526	I am a college student at the University of Houston. I have been threatened with violence three times in the last two minutes. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I was lucky enough to be rescued. The final time I was rescued by campus police. I believe that every college campus should be forced to allow campus carry, regardless of the views of the dean or students. The only argument I see against this is the "danger" of students carrying, but statistics have proven that people carrying CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without a license.
1527	As simple as that may seem, from a socioeconomic point of view, mainstream activist feminism is beginning to look like a group of middle class and upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their daily behaviour, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched. Some women writing in a feminist bent, particularly the ones promoting teaching women to be more assertive in the workplace, are a big deal, but I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. The comments of construction workers don't determine the wages of women or their ability to participate in American economic or political life. The actions and remarks of people like Justin Mateen do. So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices? Why do street harassment and terms of address deserve more attention than institutional discrimination?
1528	I'm aware that the frontmen of the 90s grunge bands weren't explicitly sold as sex symbols, but let's take a look at the frontmen. Kurt Cobain, who was a pretty, blonde, blue-eyed guy who looked like his uncle Eddie Vedder, was pretty good looking, but not quite as good looking as Chris Cornell, who was pretty good looking, but not quite as good looking as women, Layne Staley, who was pretty good looking, but not quite as good looking as women, but that's not the case.
1529	I watched the Spider-Man movies when I was probably six years old and I didn't see anything wrong with them. When I watched them again 10 years later I thought maybe sometimes Toby was a bit mopey but I don't understand why there is so much aggression toward the actor. He was decent in the Great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? People complain about his various faces on the Internet. I have only noticed one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please explain more. Thank you.
1530	I'm going to add some arguments here, but please don't feel obliged to address them in detail. There are many things I've probably missed or forgotten.
1531	I was at my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important. I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a human being (I can usually tell if it is automated). Then, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though). I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seem to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for. I could write more of my opinion, but I really want to be wrong. Thank you.
1532	The numbers are as follows: 24 grams of sugar per 8 ounces of Coca-Cola Classic, 27 grams of Pepsi, 28 grams of ingredients: Arizona Tea, filtered water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, lemon flavor, Coke, carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, flavors, caffeine. The first two ingredients are basically the same: water and high fructose corn syrup. Of course, Arizona gets its flavor from the tea leaves, while Coke gets its flavor from the flavoring. Both stain teeth, Coke has a caramel color, while Arizona gets its color from the tea leaves. I like both drinks, but I think they're both terrible at the moment and should only be used in moderation.
1533	I've read that America spends three times more on Special Education students than on normal students. I find it puzzling that Special Education students in New York get at least one or two teachers who are personally teaching them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. But many needy schools don't even have a laptop cart, and all Special Education students have individual tablets. I think the Special Education system needs to be seriously reformed, but if anyone can refute that argument, I'm open to thinking differently.
1534	They want to stay in NATO and the UN, but they also want to keep the pound and all the infrastructure that the UK has built such as the NHS, the armed forces, the police, the fire service, etc. They seem to be like petulant kids biting the hand that feeds them. Of course, I would love to be corrected if they are wrong, but I don't care about being wilfully ignorant.
1535	I've seen a meme where protestors in London pour concrete over some "anti-homeless" spikes, and all the comments were positive, rather than negative. Usually, businesses want to make money, not charity, and seeing homeless people near their entrance makes many people not want to come into their shop. In my opinion, Tesco is acting in self interest, and these protestors are nothing more than ordinary thugs who should be charged with property destruction and must bear the costs that they have incurred.
1536	I'm generally against the use of capital punishment for practically every reason but crimes against humanity, as I believe killing another person is a matter of concern for humanity as a whole, and I don't believe it's appropriate for crimes like murder or rape. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion, and I'm willing to change my mind. I hope to hear something new, not just an argument about how wrong some examples are.
1537	Whether abortion is morally wrong is not the point of pro-life or pro-choice. Likewise, one can be pro-choice and still support capital punishment, wars of aggression, etc.
1538	I'm completely against online piracy, since you steal content from big companies like Fox or EA, but that's not the fact that they're the ones who deserve the money they've been working for. The Pirate Bay doesn't even try to hide that it's purpose is the distribution of torrented copies of copyrighted content.
1539	It is customary to refer to a person by his honorifics, such as "Doctor", "Your honor", or "Captain." However, it is not appropriate to refer to a person by his honorifics, such as "King, Queen, Majesty, Prince, etc.). Why? (1) Because nobles are not owed any honorifics, they are passed down through family lines. A doctor earns his title, a duke does not. (2) Because nobles are historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had an unfair power over the rest of society.
1540	It's not that our generation has learned from its past that people are not immortal, it's just that they don't live forever. People die, people leave, change, and most importantly, they can't always be there for you. And when that happens, all you have is yourself, your goals, your hobbies, your interests and your money.
1541	Opera is great, it's got all the good features of the browsers, but it's not recognized much. For instance, Opera's "Speed dial" is a shortcut to your 9 most used bookmarks when you create a blank tab. It's got a lot of add-ons, but its community is just starting.
1542	I think baseball is America's most popular sport, and that's what all sports are trying to achieve, and that's why people get together at the time of Babe Ruth.
1543	It matters to me exactly as much as the usual flu, which is to say, "nothing." As is so often the case, ordinary precautions such as washing hands regularly with non-antibacterial soap, sneezing on tissues or handkerchiefs, and simply staying at home when you're ill would do a hellish lot to put an end to this "epidemic."
1544	They hate the U.S. because we're not Muslim, and there's no rational argument against that, since it's just a fact that they're making those statements. It's more easily argued that they'd attack US interests in the Mideast and elsewhere, because of US support for Israel and interference in Mideast politics.
1545	I'm sorry to say this, but the Eagles lost 23-11 this season, or maybe I don't remember. And with Brian Westbrook and Donovan McNabb healthy, with their helpers like Desean Jackson and Kevin Curtis, the offense will not be stopped. Also, their defensive line is very good, with people like Asante Samuel and their new additions, it will be like pick paluza with the Eagles.
1546	It is my opinion that Sadism is the most repulsive act that a person can commit, and that is why it is so hard for a person to act in this way. It is a form of masochism, though it is done by means of another person. This is called "assisted masochism" (as opposed to assisted suicide).
1547	I wonder how we can't all believe in a supreme creator, be it God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other gods that people choose to worship, because things like this make me wonder how we can't all believe in a supreme creator, be it God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other gods that people choose to worship.
1548	Yes, the fix is in, just like boxing and wrestling, and baseball, too, because of the billions of dollars of gambling money it brings in.
1549	I don't know, the open platform seems strange. Game producers will, of course, have a much easier time developing games, but I don't understand why they have a "Xbox", "Playstation" and "Nintendo" station on it. It's just that they make their own consoles, so why would they have to be tied to one box? Compared to third party producers, they haven't made any games, so it seems that they would lose a significant amount of profits. I want to see competition, competition is what keeps hardware progressing and pushing things forward.
1550	It is one of the most important ways to reduce poverty. If education is forced upon the poor, they will not be capable of affording it, and we will be in a society where only the wealthy and powerful survive.
1551	Elvis is famous all over the world, but he's still popular. He's a legend that will never die.
1552	The SPICE engineering process category provides more detailed information on the requirements and integration tests as compared to CMMI, and the SPICE provides a sophisticated list of the typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics which greatly contributes to the development of the work product, whereas CMMI does not have such a systematic approach to the work product.
1553	I'm sure it could have happened, given the reactions around the world to events in one country and the ripple effect. When Tianan Square happened, there was a reaction all over the world, not mass riots, but very strong opinions and a lot of news. The world is too open now to try and hide things like that, and I'm sure I can imagine how it could have happened.
1554	A truck is definitely better than a car, not only because you can carry and tow things, but also because you have the power and ability to pull yourself out of a mud that you might accidentally drive yourself into while talking on the phone.
1555	I'd rather my president had specified where the 200 or so prisoners would go rather than Guantanamo Bay. If he had, I would have been more inclined to agree. But, given the waterboarding incidents that many people call torture, and the whole "It's Cuba's property, not ours!" thing, I think the base should remain open. But then, what do I know? I'm only 19, and I haven't visited Guantanamo Bay, so I don't know the exact details. I haven't been in the armed forces or personally dealt with terrorists, so my opinion isn't based on much.
1556	I think it is justified to fear one of the few major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in its scriptures. For instance: "But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever you find them, beleaguered them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)... " Surah 9:5 or "O you who believe! Fight and slay the Unbelievers who are guarded by you, and know that Allah is with those who fear Him" (Surah 9:123)...
1557	First of all, I am a newbie on this site, so please don't hurt me. Saga was ahead of time, which is why it didn't really take off like Nintendo or Playstation. The Saga Dreamcast was the best thing ever, and it came with CDs before anything else. The Gamegear system was also wicked and ahead of time.
1558	I've been subject to three debates in a single day criticizing my views on how to keep convinceme's seriousness. Convinceme is the sole administrator of this site, so I'm free to follow his rules on any topic I want, but he hasn't. He's left us as a community to decide on our own. I don't like the fact that intelligent debates are easily swept up by repeats, which takes away the seriousness of the site I've come to appreciate and feel obliged to preserve.
1559	The credit belongs to the troops, yes, I know Obama signed it, which, in my opinion, is a mistake, because Clinton has Osama in his hair but chose not to fire, but it is not a victory for Obama, nor is it a victory for Bush, democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives, but rather a victory for America's military and its people.
1560	I don't like Vegas, but I can't get out of it for work. I've been to Mesa a few times, and I've never been disappointed. The food isn't bad, but the service is great, and the food is great.
1561	We were staying in a hotel in Paris the first morning we had breakfast here, the waiter was very friendly and helpful, so we didn't hesitate to have breakfast there again the second morning. Unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us was not very helpful or friendly. They had dishes that weren't on the menu, he mumbled some unfathomable dishes, gave us lukewarm coffee and after he served the food, I had to ask the waiter to fill up the coffee cup. The food was good, but the second waiter was a complete failure.
1562	I've been here a couple of times, very popular, but I don't know exactly why. The service is slow, but the staff is very attractive, the food isn't very good, and the place is very noisy when it's full.
1563	I was told by coworkers that this place was popular with Thanksgiving sandwiches, so I went to see it. I wasn't too impressed, but the food was decent, the service was decent, and the prices were a bit high.
1564	I'm not sure how bad this meal was, but the staff was very helpful and comped our meals. However, they said that the gift cards I used were not able to use the last 10% on them and they needed another $30.00. We were unaware that they had taken all the money off the gift cards, so they stole $30.00 from us. There's no way to prove it, but be careful when using gift cards. I'm going to tell my friends about this!
1565	You'll see that the service is an issue. Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday. The staff was young, I didn't see anyone older than 22 years old. Perhaps they need someone older with customer experience? The food was good, the bok choy was excellent, but we didn't find it too spicy.
1566	I'm fond of fried fish, so I tried it. It's a cheap meal, but it's not very good. Think frozen fish squares on a bun. I got the deluxe, which included mayo, lettuce and tomato, but no crust, which is incredibly stupid, because it might have salvaged the bland sandwich, especially since they barely added any mayo. I won't be back.
1567	School uniforms are a terrible idea. Children won't be able to show their colors.
1568	It's so bad, I know I'll miss the days when I don't have to dress in uniform.
1569	I've always thought it's a good idea to dress in a uniform at school, because it's nice and respectful. It shows the status of schools and students.
1570	Very good arguments that IE should be a better browser, but it isn't!
1571	I can't beat these amazing skins that allow me to modify my browser, the built-in spell check, and everything else that IE has to offer.
1572	I'm not comfortable with the idea of creating separate style sheets for Internet Explorer.
1573	I wouldn't turn them in, because it would've been too strange for me to bring them in for the police. I wouldn't have told anybody, I hope they catch them, but I wouldn't have said anything.
1574	All TV shows are written in script form, a form of book, first...
1575	I'm going to say books are better than TV because they have all the details in a short time, and we can read them like books like stories, fairy tales, ghost stories, etc. They help us to understand the imaginary power of our heads, and sometimes we don't understand them very well, but in books we can remember them easily.
1576	It takes a lot of effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.
1577	I'd rather be without a father than have a bad father, because I don't wanna find out how bad he is and how bad he is. I'd rather be alone with my mother, that's all.
1578	I'd say it's better not to have a bad father, because he can't do anything for the family. Imagine a father who drinks and beats his mother, and you don't have any meaning to have a father. He's a violent, raging monster in the house, and you're just as ashamed to call him a father.
1579	Raffles left some important plans and policies for the development of the colony before he left Singapore.
1580	Well, the definition of the founder was discussed in the classroom that day, that the founder wasn't the one who discovered the place, but the one who set up the raffles which came to Singapore and established it worldwide, although it might have been Farquhar who suggested this to the raffles.
1581	Pornography is wrong, it's wrong because it doesn't do anything good. If it did, it would really be wrong.
1582	It is wrong in the Bible, but it can also be an addiction that destroys lives, just as drugs and alcohol do.
1583	Hell yeah, porn is wrong. I mean, wtf. film naked girls, distribute it publicly on the internet so that jerks can get away with it. If it's not wrong, then try watching it in front of your family, friends or younger youth. You'll feel uncomfortable and you'll understand why. Because of common sense and our conscience.
1584	What's the point of porn? sex What's the point of sex? making a baby why should you watch others make a baby? pleasure What causes pleasure? temptation What are you doing to avoid temptation? -> then do it.
1585	You can't argue with the theory of creatoinism without getting into a ridiculous argument, because anyone who believes in creatoinism and is arguing with anyone who can't say that God makes them think what they think, TAKE A HIT EVERYONE ELSE THE THOUGHT IS MORONIC!
1586	IE7 on Vista has a protected mode that runs the browser in a secure environment with minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are web browsers with occasional security problems, so I'd rather use a browser with a better security architecture.
1587	Yes, because some children, especially wealthy children of wealthy parents, do not understand anything except physical education.
1588	Raffles had left Singapore and come back after a long time, while Farquar had remained here all along and had solved many problems.
1589	It doesn't matter to Raffles that he was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one who made Singapore what it is today.
1590	William had taken the initiative of understanding the local people and communicating with them. He had even learned Malay so that he could talk more easily.
1591	Yes, try to enforce it. It's not illegal to kill yourself anywhere (have you ever been to Oregon?) if you are pro-choice and keep abortion legal. It's up to the woman and her God, not the government.
1592	sabrejimmy, I've asked you to prove that we're not evolving. I haven't said that we're evolving anywhere near, and I don't think you've got any evidence yet. Until you can prove that we're not evolving, you're avoiding something that you're not capable of answering.
1593	The peppered moth experiment was a bad experiment, and it didn't show evolution. But that doesn't mean that other experiments and observations aren't showing evolution.
1594	For more information on radiometric dating, please refer to www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html.
1595	Pornography kills no one, it's a profitable source of entertainment for some people. Can anyone tell me what's wrong with it, without introducing their moral standards into the argument?
1596	I'm not degraded by porn, you're not fond of it, don't watch it. Life is more important than being my personal moral police.
1597	It is always a question of benefiting oneself, but it is only once in a lifetime that we have the opportunity to improve the lives or situations of the masses, or even of ourselves.
1598	I think it's a good idea, so students don't have to worry about what to wear, they'll be more focused on studying, so it's more effective. If someone else says they can't express themselves, oh, please, there are so many ways to express yourself. And uniform indirectly tells them how to dress correctly. If we let them dress, they could wear inappropriate clothes like hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes, which isn't good for their minds.
1599	It's better to have a bad father, because he's not only a provider but also a protector. Almost all the bad fathers are bad because they go out and do their jobs without spending much time with their children. Some children grow up without a father, and they think that they have a father in any way.
1600	I'm saying lousy, if you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, inaccessible, unintelligent, boring, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, unintelligent, un
1601	The drinking of bottled water has direct links with certain diseases, including cancer.
1602	TV is much better because it has a wider variety of activities and some people say it's intransitable, but now you can watch TV on a mobile phone which is very convenient.
1603	A picture's worth a thousand words, and a video's more powerful and immediate.
1604	You wouldn't have jobs without TV, and you wouldn't have any idea what's happening in the world without TV.
1605	Many believe that this is due to European culture, which has had very polluted waters since farming and industry started in the Industrial Revolution, which has helped us.
1606	Craig's a hypocryte filled with bottled water and shouldn't be taken seriously.
1607	Bottled water is not bad for the world, because after you have drunk your water, you can reuse it several times to make more water bottles using less plastic. Plastic is also recyclable, and can be used to make new objects, such as new plastic bottles, so technically, you can reuse the same plastic bottle over and over again. It will not be bad for the economy if we can learn how to reuse properly.
1608	The Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together in 2006 to develop guidelines for schools on how to reduce the calories consumed by beverage companies and to encourage healthier choices for children. The guidelines were prepared to reduce the total calories in all beverages shipped to schools by beverage companies, and a survey was carried out among parents, physicians and family physicians. The highest supported choice for each group was bottled water.
1609	The real question is, why is the government involved in this? We regulate personal and religious institutions, then the government comes back and wants to redefine them. It shouldn't be a political issue, because my personal and religious matters should be separated from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not be mixed.
1610	It is wrong to marry a homosexual. God created man and woman to live on earth. How can a human species survive if they are only interested in the same sex? Obviously not.
1611	It's another "look me up" stunt, I think, and I think homosexuals are the product of overprotective parents, abuse or liberal awakening. If you stop calling attention to yourselves, no one would really care about what you're doing.
1612	I'm a passionate Christian, and I believe that homosexual marriage is wrong. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should respect the beliefs that have made us what we are today.
1613	Oh, really David, why do people from your country come to India for peace and relief, why do most of the world's major companies have the biggest number of Indian employees because we are geniuses and we are actually superior in intelligence. In the past we have led the world and we will certainly lead the world again in the near future.
1614	India has the potential to lead the world, full of natural resources, full of highly spiritual people, and a country of various languages and races. India has the potential to thrive.
1615	You're saying that India has these things, other countries don't have them. Does America, which seems to be leading the world, have these things too? It eats less and wastes more. The amount of food they waste can be used to feed the entire Indian population. It causes more pollution and blames us. What about that?
1616	Intelligence Design theory is merely a disguise for science, but there's no science behind Intelligence Design.
1617	It has caused many wars, encouraged racism, sexism and homophobicity. It has given us prejudices and prejudiced us. It is time to end it.
1618	I think that's what should be done, at least as a last resort, because I've been spanked with my sister and it turned out that I was disciplined, and on the flip side, our youngest sister hasn't been spanked and she's making more mistakes than we have now that she's 10 years old.
1619	Yes, so they'll have a reason not to do it again.
1620	Yes, because they're not going to do what they did for fear of being spanked again, and because they'll be aware of the consequences. But there's also a line that parents shouldn't cross, like the appropriate spanking and abuse limit.
1621	As long as the parents don't spank the child too often, or they don't use other things like belts, it's okay.
1622	Atheists rely on proof even though they don't have any. So if my religion doesn't have any proof, then it gives your religion proof? It doesn't make sense. Where atheists don't have any evidence, Christians do, and what they have to back up is the Bible, what do atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a bunch of crap.
1623	I strongly believe that children should not be punished physically, such as by spanking, if they have a strong, healthy relationship with their parents, if they have gained respect. Children will respect their parents and agree to their decisions, even if they do not like them.
1624	Some children don't learn by spanking, so why waste your time on that when you can always get something valuable out of them.
1625	I'd say yes, 'cause you shouldn't kill anybody and say it was a mistake, that's not right. I don't care what anybody else thinks about it.
1626	I'd shoot him, 'cause killing somebody is wrong, no matter what. If he can kill one person, why can't he kill me?
1627	It depends on whether you've known the victim or not, and whether he's a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, I'd definitely turn him in, because he's considered a psycho, and what if he kills me as well. But if he killed a person I've known, and he's hurting us, then I'd think about it.
1628	I'd have turned my husband in, 'cause it's just wrong.'
1629	If you kill someone, I think you should do the right thing and confess yourself instead of waiting and wondering if anyone else will turn you in. I know it's hard for me to confess my wife, but they committed a horrible crime and should be held accountable.
1630	If a woman is raped and has a child, she should be allowed to choose whether to abort or not. If she is irresponsible and has no protection, she should be held accountable for her actions. She should give birth to a child and adopt it. Otherwise, she will use her power of choice to kill a child because she is too weak or ignorant to use protection.
1631	One word: adoption There's absolutely no reason to abort if you can keep the pregnancy and then adopt the baby. This is a fact that is often ignored in the debate about abortion, but I believe that this is the best option.
1632	Statistics show that fewer than 1% of women who are raped have a child because of the adrenaline rush. We have no right to kill an unborn child. There are ways to avoid this. A woman can have a child and give it up for adoption or raise it as a child because she is still a mother. There are thousands of people waiting to have another child added to their family. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously have not been through an abortion or a rape.
1633	This is very uncommon and can usually be treated with contraception if the female seeks medical help after the assault
1634	The main classes are more important, children should be more interested in learning, and competitiveness can lead to bullying.
1635	physicis ed is just another class, students should start to be responsible for their actions at the age of 16, if they are responsible for their car, they should be responsible for their health. The taxpayers don't even realize that they pay for students to go swimming or playing for an entire hour.
1636	If students do not have a physical education class, the obesity rate will be even higher than it is now. This is one of the reasons why physical education reduces heart failure, improved physical fitness, weight reduction, self discipline and stress.
1637	Why is that important? If two people love one another so much that they marry, shouldn't that be what the Bible teaches us? All those Bible nuts, by the way, make me sick.
1638	Just because they're gay doesn't mean they don't have a right to be happy. How would you feel if you were refused? We've got a 21st Century world, and everyone else is allowed to get married, so why shouldn't they?
1639	It may be against the Bible's teachings, but only because homosexuals have no children, which is why they were forbidden, and also because it was perceived to weaken the position of men. Time has changed, it's time to accept it.
1640	It is better to pursue personal goals, because it is your job to decide what your life will be about. You will not always have someone beside you who will tell you what's good or bad, but it is up to you to achieve your goals. It is also a good thing to assist others in accomplishing their goals.
1641	It seems to me that it's a good idea to do both, but you have to help yourself first.
1642	Even though we have free speech in America, if our speech causes riots or if it is reasonable to assume that what you say could cause others to act injuriously or break the law, there may be legal repercussions. This is because it is necessary to prove that the actions of others were directly and solely caused by the words or actions of others, which can be difficult.
1643	If that's true, given that we're dealing with a fairly short period of time, then you're probably fine. But what matters is how you say what you say. The facts are one thing, but if you choose a hurtful way of saying what you say, it could be regarded as an unjustified verbal assault, which could be taken into account under the circumstances.
1644	They used to be abused at home, they didn't like themselves very much, they knew they could be murdered anytime, and they still did.
1645	Strangely, the crown has been ordered to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the indigenous peoples of New Zealand, even though the treaty is not recognised by international law. In my opinion, the treaties established during colonial times should burden the common wealth.
1646	I think you're a Marine, and some of them can be forgiven if you do the right thing.
1647	I don't think you'll get anything out of this, not only because you have to prove they knew about the damage, but also because the court doesn't accept just assumptions. If you buy a used car next time, take it somewhere and have it examined, if the dealer won't let you have it examined and sign that there's no damage, I'd recommend you seek legal assistance.
1648	It's a shame you've described, but the system we have built is the best we've ever made, but it's not perfect, and mistakes are always made. As you rightly say, the public "pretenders" aren't helpful, but they're the ones who can't stop. People can do anything, even if they're in jail, and they can learn the law and fight for it. The deadlines are crucial, and life isn't fair. Sometimes people can't focus on what has happened, but instead they can focus on the future and do their best every day.
1649	The law should be passed, the country is governed by law, and there should be no way that anyone can break the law because they want to survive.
1650	It really cannot in a common law jurisdiction, because the idea of common law is that the rulings of the courts are binding on the lower courts, so it cannot be illegal to do what they are made to do. Civil law systems, for instance, France or Lousisana, operate differently, and the rulings of the courts are not binding in the same way as in common law.
1651	I've always been careful not to use rubber checks, they're just too expensive and not worth it.
1652	It's legal, because salaried employees don't get overtime, but the law still applies to salaried employees, So calculate how many hours you work each year and divide your salary by that number. If the result is less than the federal minimum wage (5.15), the state minimum wage (7.53), or even the local minimum wage (9.50) in Santa Fe, then your employer is violating the law.
1653	The Webmaster is right, not only is this unethical, but it's akin to the workings of Stalin during the Cold War. It's a catastrophe, and it doesn't surprise me that he has an idea of public safety which destroys, ends and controls the lives of his citizens, allowing the real evil to do havoc, and that it will be over before the next one of his people and innocent civilians are murdered.
1654	This is written by a white man, so don't think I'm complaining about the fact that cops are brutal.
1655	It's President Clinton, and though people are gonna say it's just politics, it's the same thing. If it's wrong now, it's wrong then.
1656	Yes, and most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge sentences people to jail, takes away their liberty, but it's fine for him to be sitting at his desk drunk. The whole city knows, lawyers, cops, etc., and we watched him get pulled over one night and taken home. But how can you fight that?
1657	The death penalty is not a form of vengeance, but rather a punishment for having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of peers. SEP> The law establishes what crimes and under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty.
1658	Certainly not, unless you are a registered real estate broker and you have a written agreement signed by all the beneficiaries of the real estate sale, or by a court of the same effect. The additional fees for the real estate sale may be based on the following: extra time and liability, not on a percentage of the sale price, which would constitute a commission.
1659	The stem cell research could have been a great help in saving millions of lives, but perhaps the procedures and treatments arising from stem cell research could have been optional.
1660	Get a new boyfriend. He's not capable of changing or wanting to change. He's been sent to rehabilitation for a second chance and messed it up. And simultaneously, he's been caught driving with a suspended driver's license. And if they find out about the violation and the fact that he's been expelled from rehabilitation, he could be in jail for a long time. I highly recommend you break up with him. It's going downhill fast. I know you're dedicated to him, but give that devotion to someone who can give it a shot instead of wasting time.
1661	He's wrong, property is property, he'll own it as long as he can pay taxes and mortgage, and his business will stay his business, and the government cannot take it away just because he's here illegally.
1662	The software itself is not illegal, but using it to make illegal copies is still illegal.
1663	I've had a similar situation with my husband, who had an expired ID from another country and the consulate didn't have any ID, so we just asked the DMV what we should do. They suggested we ask for official school records, which you request and keep sealed, and then the DMV would open them. They just wanted to make sure it was you.
1664	Oh, you're either very young or you're new to this country. If you've got money or you're famous, you can buy whatever judgment or law you want. If you're poor, you're not lucky. Attorneys won't take your case unless it means a lot of money to them. Even if you're completely correct, unless they can make a fortune, they won't take it.
1665	They don't follow traditional liberalism, but some libertarians and some republics follow it. They don't like to change the status quo, the stability of society, but they do not want to see a complete anarchy, but rather a strong government protecting the people.
1666	I apologize, I'm wrong, Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing Prison. (You must actually read the stuff you Google before you decide and post your answer here.) Although she was listed as the 1st female executed by electrocution, Louisiana executed several women, the 1st woman executed by electric chair was Toni Jo Henry on November 28, 1942, 64 years ago today, a good question considering the date today.
1667	I think he has every right to ask the woman to remove the veil if he can't hear her clearly. If the woman who is a lawyer isn't able to be heard in court, she isn't doing her job properly because of the veil, and the judge can't do his job properly either.
1668	I don't think terrorists should have equal rights, but I do think they should be treated like people. If they can't be calm, they shouldn't be able to go out. If terrorists are incapable of reform, and continue to be disrective, they shouldn't be allowed to go out.
1669	I don't know, but if you want to drink, but don't drink and drive, it's a sin and an inexcusable thing to do.
1670	It's not the reaction times, it's the crime itself that you're being sanctioned for. It's the fact that there are special laws governing alcholol and other drugs. But while it's easy to detect the use of drugs and alcohol in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to detect the emotional or situational impairment. So, driving while intoxicated can be punished separately, because there are objective standards, but anything else can only be sanctioned on the basis of the objective results.
1671	Not only that, but she can pretty much just decide she's bored with the marriage and leave the baby with him, force you to sell your house and move in with Joe-shmoe who's ten times richer than you while forcing you to pay her... the law needs to be changed... a parent should not be able to just throw the towel on a whim and leave the kids with the kids if they want to leave without judgment that the spouse they are leaving is dangerous, an adulterer or mentally unstable... then they should leave without any guilt...
1672	No, it's not. There are some rules on what you can and cannot do with the flag, assuming you're talking about the world's finest and prettiest flag, Old Glory. See the link below for more.
1673	I'm sorry to hear this, I'm sure you're in love with him, but you mustn't confuse the feelings of love with the ones you have for another woman. What about the other woman he's with? Has he talked to her yet? If I were you, I'd try to avoid her, and if he manages to end the relationship with the other woman and keep the relationship with the children, I think you could reconsider. I don't know the law or deformities, but I would say no to both of those questions, but think about the people involved and how your decisions will affect them. It's difficult, I know, good luck.
1674	I think you're aware of what's going on, and you're probably trying to grow it, because the seeds don't fly out of the birds. Any dumbass knows what MJ looks like from the leaf. Yeah, you can get into trouble for growing marijuana, not that much if you only have one plant and say you don't know what it is. They're not going to believe you anyway. You won't get arrested. If the cops find out, your friends aren't your friends.
1675	There's no real solution, but there's a lot of people who use illegal drugs and alcohol. And there's a lot of people who don't care about the fact that they use drugs and alcohol.
1676	Unfortunately, it is not likely that the Court will interfere with the present incident. Hopefully, however, it will be able to accept such things as the ban on late pregnancy, the requirement that parents inform their children of their sexual orientation, and the requirement that these "doctors" must be required to report abuse as all other doctors.
1677	Why not? People complain that it's against God, so they're supposed to refuse invitations to marriage from homosexuals. MAN MAKES THEM RULES, USE GOD AS THE EVENING MAN, AND MAN IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THEM. MAN IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THEM. MAN IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THEM. MAN IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THEM. MAN IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM. MAN MAKES THEM.

1678	I'm sure that ADHD and some forms of autism aren't bad, but they're the next level of human evolution.
1679	It is as if the free market made everything a Utopia, and that's what makes you dogmatic.
1680	I'm in my 20's, healthy, and I get mail all the time about donating bone marrow, which costs between a third of a million dollars to $800,000 to transplant my marrow I'm giving away free of charge, and I'd jump at the chance to sell my liver. If I don't get on that list, I shouldn't be able to use it as a defense against abortion. The medical industry is making money hand over fist and I want a piece of it. If women have the right to abortion because of their right to bodily autonomy, then I should have the right to sell my marrow and organs because of my right to bodily autonomy.
1681	I think the proof lies in the pudding: take something you consider to be your knowledgeable and look at the news coverage. You'll find that the information is, at best, partial. You'll find people who "read an article" in your field and understand how naive they are. Journalists can only provide so much context and it's usually never enough for the layperson to understand the subject.
1682	I'm thinking about this every time I see a truck or bus with "This vehicle stops at all railroad crossings" on its back. I think stopping, listening to a train and driving again is much more dangerous than not stopping at a train crossing.
1683	I've not thought about it much in the last few minutes, and I'm not sure it's possible that it's not flawed, so I'm trying to find counterarguments. I'm not a US citizen, so I don't know how your system works.
1684	I'm a 19 year old male student at college majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math. I don't have any intimate relationships, I don't think I'm attractive, I'm very fat, and I don't look very nice. And even if I were to be given a chance, I wouldn't have lasted more than a day. I think I'm a weird guy, I have some weird songs on my iPod, I watch weird videos, and I don't have any hobbies except playing video games, surfing the internet, and watching movies. I don't think I'm meant to be in a healthy, mature relationship with a woman, I think I need to find some meaning in my life beyond passing on my genes.
1685	The Lion King was a very boring and flat Disney movie, even if you had not seen or heard Kimba the White Lion. The characters and songs were not very different from any other Disney movie.
1686	I think it's a good idea to let people know about lottery winners, and that could lead to people believing the whole thing is a ruse, and that nobody really wins big prizes. But it's ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in jackpot money disappear without any lottery employees coming forward. And why do we not question the legitimacy of other big prizes? People have been buying lottery tickets for a long time without the ridiculous self-identification laws.
1687	I'm working in LA's central business district and there's a lot of homeless people here. They're always walking around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the subway because we don't have turnstiles and honor systems. They're annoying and they really hurt the local economy.
1688	I had booked a flight with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur two hours before the MH17 incident. Yesterday I received an email from Malaysia Airlines offering a full refund or changing the reservation to another date. I am now questioning the safety record of the airline, even though it seems that nothing could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy.
1689	I'm not sure how this game is going to be revolutionary, but it seems to me like Borderlands in a different setting and tone. But otherwise it's a solid looking FPS that concentrates on classes, co-op, and loot in a variety of small open worlds.
1690	CMV : I'm a Canadian, but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I see that everyone in Canada is trying to preserve their culture and flag, which represents their blood line and heritage. It seems to me that this is a good thing, but it leads to bigotry and stagnation of one's cultural and personal development.
1691	I think kids owe their parents everything, because they brought them into this world and gave them life and shelter and health during their childhood. Kids should stay at home or at least as close to home as possible their entire lives, so that if a parent needs help, they can stop what they're doing and help the parents because they owe them their lives.
1692	All the things SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about are things that most men don't do. It's a stereotype. Anecdotal evidence isn't a clear indicator of "oppression" overblown.
1693	I think the Japanese need to protect themselves better against China. The Chinese are becoming stronger both economically and militarily, and I'm sure they have many generals who want to get back at the Japanese for all the atrocities committed during World War II. And they won't even admit the genocide, which is just a relic of the past. On the other hand, I know Japan is being protected by the US, but how much can they rely on them? Will the US go to war with China over Japan or South Korea, for instance? I don't think that will happen, and in a desperate situation, they would just choose to abandon their allies.
1694	The purpose of Affirmative Action is to level the playing field and give every student a chance to go to college, no matter their background. The skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen, but given at birth by parents. Why should the scholarships be based on this unearned, pre-decided trait?
1695	I'm aware that the Democratic Party is the biggest contributor to PACs, and I'm aware that unions pay us very little money, and Teamsters and other unions supply a relatively small amount of money to politicians, rather than corporations. I think that the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a good democratic check on capital, and I think that the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a good democratic check on the power of capital.
1696	I don't know what the popular view on Reddit is on this, but in real world, I hear arguments about what the founding fathers would have thought. I don't think it matters, because the founding fathers weren't gods who could prepare for any problem or know everything. We live in a different time than the founding fathers, and even if we didn't, they weren't infallible. I don't think the view deserves any more merit than it was one of the founding fathers. I believe political scientists should focus on what would be the best solution to an issue rather than interpreting what the founding fathers would have done.
1697	I've been struggling with this for a long time, and I can't justify it just because the net gain is good. It's an open Pandora's box for me.
1698	I'm sorry, I'm not sure that I'm in the majority, but I think it's wrong to call women curvy because they aren't the same as fat.
1699	So creationists are arguing that evolution is wrong and creationism is right, but the fossil record shows that ancient clams lived in layers beneath giant land sloths. If all organisms lived at the same time, how could a giant land sloth that moves at 1 mph or less survive and survive an organism that thrives in water during a global flood? It seems to me that this is a preposterous question and that the flood never occurred.
1700	The reality TV is a mess, first of all, it's scripted, it's just a fun thing to watch, and it's not really reality.
1701	I am embarrassingly ignorant of the current status of this project, so perhaps some of you kind souls can fill me in. I am wholly convinced that a useful stipped-down laptop can be manufactured for less than $100. I was always supplied with a super-smart Asus EEE laptop which cost around $300 USD when traveling. I am also wholly convinced that access to information infrastructure is a crucial part of nation building, but Microsoft Powerpoint is not. (In fact, that inspires a new debate topic!) Perhaps someone can clarify to me, will these laptops have internet access?
1702	Yes, friends are passing and disappearing, but my family and I have lived together all my life, and they're the most constant people I know. We're all alike, and we have the same blood, we're all alike, and we're all stronger and more intelligent than any other creature on this planet.
1703	I don't know if the creator of this debate had any particular event in mind when he posted this, but I'm willing to participate anyway. I don't feel like voting for the "well of course" option, but I can say that at least 5.3% is a bit stupid for voting for the BNP.
1704	I've never been married, but I've been with someone for a long time so I can say it's the same thing. When you're new, your hormones are running and you're excited about being with someone different. After a while, you feel the excitement of being with someone else, the same position, girl, same thing. I think it's much better to have sex with someone, to constantly be in the mood for it, to not be able to keep your hands off one another.
1705	Well, let's take a look at the facts, shall we? He was known to have extremist Islamic views, he swore at Allahu Akbar during the attack, he was connected to extremist terrorists, he expressed hatred towards infidels, he frequented Jihadi websites.
1706	Death is a part of life, the empty tombs that remind you of who you are, not what you are, nor what you will be to everyone else. At funerals, they remind you that the dead will no longer be what they were to their survivors. It's selfishness, celebrate the dead, everything about them, remember, and be happy.
1707	We don't talk about killing for fun, we talk about putting an animal in misery, so your argument isn't relevant. We are talking about the fact that humans have a responsibility to their wives and children, especially children, who depend on their parents not only for food but also for education and so on.
1708	I don't know if it's possible to kill someone who's dead, since video games and movies are all we've got to go on.
1709	Yes, and no. Art is art, and it's right if it's in the proper place, i.e. the neighborhood, the nightclub, etc. It's part of the culture, and it's a good thing. But no, because it's defacing public buildings, historical monuments, bridges in public areas and otherwise beautiful landmarks in town, it's wrong.
1710	Runes were first symbols of magic, and later they evolved into a kind of writing system that is today, I don't know what its actual name is, but the characters are incredible and I believe that this writing system is the finest writing system ever to be seen
1711	Animal testing should be allowed until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing, including suitable habitats, good diets, no cruel treatment, and only certain diseases or maladjustments. They should not use animal testing for cosmetics or perfume, but if they are testing a drug that may cure cancer, animal testing might be the best option, given that it is cheap and yet very effective.
1712	It is absolutely not, for everyone has a different morality. For instance, if a pro-choicer is involved in a debate about abortion, the pro-lifer can call him moraless as much as he likes, but that does not change the fact that the pro-choicer has valid arguments. Indeed, morality is extremely subjective, and thus a statement that someone "is moral" is about as valid as a statement that "you are unworthy".
1713	Isn't it better to buy a red iPod that sends a tiny fraction of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green iPod that fits my outfit but doesn't make a difference in the way I dress, but it's a little better than the other?
1714	Bad Company is boring, it's hard to kill people there, the controls are weird, the vehicles are boring, and the maps are too big. On Cod, the map called Wastland is the biggest, and people hate it. MW2 is very intense, because it keeps you wondering what's going to happen next, or whether a sniper is lurking around the corner or hiding in the roof, ready to shoot you, or if you're about to be attacked by a grenade, but through all this, you get hit from behind and down, and you're always wondering what's going to happen next. Battlefield is boring, because you always know where the enemy is and you don't have to go find them. You can just drive around being bored, and you don't have to worry about where the enemy is. Besides, the maps are too big, and you can't get any more ammunition than you need.
1715	School uniforms take away the individuality that makes us different.
1716	It's a shame they don't charge parking at the Venetian. It's a shame they don't charge parking at Mandalay Bay. It's just a MGM corporation. It's all over their hotels.
1717	It was a good meal, but I don't make my meals solely on calories.
1718	I've got to pay my friends a bit of a play, but this place is worth your dime.
1719	There's a really nice little restaurant called Vietnam Grille down South Blvd. It's a little dirty restaurant, but it was busy and we got our seats quick. We ordered some spring rolls and Beef Pho. The spring rolls were good, the sauces on the side of the table were applied to my plate and the sauces were added to my plate. The soup came out and it was very hot and delicious. I will be back again and again.
1720	Our waiter was great, very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal. I'm sorry. I'm not sure how bad the food is here, but there are better places in Vegas.
1721	I've always had a great experience here, and they always have great food. They always ask me if I want cheese on my sandwich and I always agree. They charge me and then I get the sandwich without cheese. But that's all I can say about them.
1722	I'm sorry to say I didn't like Caffe Boa. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to go in last night at about 7:30. Our friend called for a reservation for 4 and when we arrived with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress. We sat there for 10 minutes without any acknowledgement. We gave the server, manager, and wife a lot of time to get our food. We left and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again, maybe on a busy night, when there might be more people to be acknowledged.
1723	Schools should not create dress codes. On the one hand, uniforms help students concentrate better, on the other hand, uniforms help with discipline in a school. Kids are highly impressionable, etc., but they can have their own creativity.
1724	The fact that the uniform is always good, it will hide all the parts of the body that the school does not want the children to show, and the students would not be ashamed of what they wear.
1725	School uniforms are useless and wasteful once a child leaves school, compared to civil dress.
1726	The number of reasons why ff ie are LISTLESS:
1727	TABS, see what IE copied to version 7...
1728	I'm not sure if this is going to be a complete yes or a no answer, depending on the circumstances. If this is really going to get out of hand and the police know that my man is responsible for this, and they have all the evidence and witnesses that prove that he is guilty, then yes, I will turn him in. If he is, then it's just a matter of time.
1729	I'd never turn my wife in, but I'd try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. But I don't think it's my place to go and turn him in.
1730	It depends, really, on what happened, on what I could understand and sympathize with. If I really felt sorry for what she had done and I could sympathize with her, then perhaps I could forgive her and not bring her in.
1731	Murder is a sin unforgivable, but love is not.
1732	You don't say who killed her or why, maybe she had a reason.
1733	I'd never turn him in unless he killed more than one, because it's not possible that it was just an accident. But if I loved him enough, I could hide the facts and pretend it never happened.
1734	I could go on and on, really, the world that the books describe is very different from the one I saw.
1735	Books are nice, TV isn't. They're for geeks, TV's for weirdos, I'd say Black Ops is better.
1736	1. Books don't damage your eyes the way TV does. 2. Books allow your brain to imagine rather than doing it for you. 3. Reading a lot of books can help you spell better. 4. Reading a lot of books can help you write better. 5. Reading books teaches you how to read, while watching TV doesn't.
1737	'Cause it's better for the kids who have to do schoolwork, and it's better for their eyes. 'When they have homework,' they're supposed to be reading rather than watching TV.
1738	I think India is not ready to lead the world for many reasons.. 1. The politicians of our country are involved in black money cases and try to make as much money as possible.. 2. They always try to make a big issue out of useless topics..
1739	No, China's going to be the one who controls the world, America's going to be. India's not going to have a chance to destroy the world!
1740	Hahaha, that's a ridiculous debate. No, they don't. They're practically the 3rd world country.
1741	India has no potential to lead the world because it is full of corruption, politicians' corruption, a lot of religions fighting, etc..
1742	I said he doesn't have the position to be the founder, he has a boss and he has to follow him and not do anything else.
1743	Raffles visited Singapore on 28 January 1819 and signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johor on behalf of the British East India Company, which granted him the right to use the south part of Singapore as a trading post and settlement.
1744	Adrian Peterson, are you my husband? If not, I apologize. Your name and your speech convinced me that you were.
1745	It is absolutely wrong to say that pornography exposes people to reality in life, thus increasing their maturity and preventing future sexual assaults. It is a path that should not be taken, as bad as smoking and digging.
1746	Pornography's wrong, mainly because they don't do it right. It should be High Def, 3 years from now it'll be 3D.
1747	Except you are the same brainwashed as me, you are just as brainwashed as me.
1748	I'm using Firefox, though, because I don't wanna transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it default browser.
1749	Physical education is a waste of time and should not be taught at school.
1750	There had been a lot of crimes, like robbery and fighting, so Farquhar had set up a small police force.
1751	In the first years of Singapore, Farquar had been working on everyday problems, trying to understand the people and understand Malaysia, while Raffles had been hardly communicating with them.
1752	Your argument is invalid, because in the cases you mentioned, the mental stability and reasoning abilities are completely compromised. The State intervenes in these cases. You'll have to find a better answer. I apologize.
1753	What does legalizing drugs have to do with saving lives? Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by removing the need to illegally abort a child and kill themselves simultaneously.
1754	This is the usual view of creationism, which is that all of what Sean said is about theology. It's not about science, it's about the scientific method. If you really want to debate the science of evolution, you have to at least understand the scientific method.
1755	Is pornography wrong? Absolutely not! Everyone has a different morality, and if you don't believe in it, then don't look at it. The people who do it, and probably enjoy it, do it because they want to.
1756	Whether you're doing it for yourself or for others, you still have an impact on the people around you. When you ask someone why they've chosen to help, the answer will be, "It feels good to help." In fact, people don't help people unless they get something satisfying about it, whether it's community service, material rewards, glory, or just the satisfaction of knowing that they have a purpose.
1757	In the long run, I think it's better to advance the common good.
1758	Even though your father isn't the greatest or always there for you, he's still your father. Every father has a connection to their children, which shapes and molds their character and personality.
1759	It's better to have a father than not have one.
1760	I'd rather have a bad father than be fatherless, because I'd be at least calmer if I knew who my father was and wouldn't have to worry about him all my life.
1761	The use of water bottles, although perhaps the most powerful industry in the world, is not worth the misery of the environment, which will not start decaying for another 700 years.
1762	People drink water every day and do not realize that they are destroying their planet.
1763	The high price for bottled water is not water, but rather the costs of packaging, shipping, marketing, retailing and transport of bottled water around the world.
1764	Water bottles, good or bad?
1765	Sheep count him asleep, he won the World Series of Poker in 1995 with the Uno card.
1766	Plastic can kill many species of fish. For example, 26 pieces of fish were found in one single fish. Fish are very important to the environment as food for birds that eat bugs during the life cycle.
1767	No human being can comprehend any medium, be it television or book, without using their brains.
1768	As for the time limit and the damage to the eyes, we should watch TV only when necessary, because excessive TV is harmful, even reading books.
1769	People who don't like television keep saying it's bad for the body. I don't want to run and bring a book to read while I exercise. I think watching TV is a lot simpler than reading a book.
1770	Yes, I'd say it's a way to relax if you're tired, but you can also read to relax. And did you notice how irritating the commercials are?
1771	Marriage has evolved not only for the sake of a state's approval, but also for moral and religious reasons.
1772	India is becoming a hub for international trade and investment, I believe, and it has given the opportunity to increase trade and investment in sectors such as M&E, food processing, automobile, tourism, banking, among others.
1773	Christians are also amusing to watch, because they waste half the Sunday morning going to church.
1774	I don't believe in all religions, but the ones that follow them are the ones who were brainwashed at a very young age and really didn't think for themselves, at least the majority of the followers. And then there are those who twist ANY logic in their favor, and that's what you need to be careful of.
1775	We have believed in spirits of the heavens since recorded history, for which there is no evidence at all.
1776	I'd say you should hit your kids, 'cause if they've done something really wrong, like wrecked your car or stolen it, you have to hit them.
1777	Yes, because if they're afraid of getting hurt, they won't do it again.
1778	Only when necessary should parents use spanking as a means of disciplining, and only when the child does not behave as it should have behaved after several warnings, should they be justified in doing so.
1779	I think spanking is necessary if the child learns in the long run, but children respond differently to different punishments, while one child tells them no or gets grounded, it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.
1780	If nothing else works, I think spanking is a good way of punishing a child.
1781	I support this because I've been spanked and I've grown to be a good daughter..Spanking teaches you not to do it again and fear doing it again.
1782	I'd also like to remind you that atheism predates Christianity, which is a bad argument to begin with.
1783	Parents should not use spanking as a means of disciplining, it only makes the child angry rather than showing what they have done wrong.
1784	No, spanking isn't the answer to your problems. You should speak with love and understanding to your child so that they understand what they are doing.
1785	I'd turn her in with the quickness, 'cause she's crazy, loco, insane, and I'm not trying to be her next victim.
1786	I understand that some people are crazy about love, but it's not right or acceptable to take someone else's life.
1787	Murder is a crime that cannot be overlooked, sleeping next to a person who committed it, and knowing that you are responsible for it, makes you as guilty as those who are responsible.
1788	There's no excuse for killing a fetus, a child, a child, anyone. If a woman is raped, it's not her fault. The woman and the child should speak for the child and know that the child wishes to live.
1789	I'm so tired of running and I really don't like it.
1790	P.E. doesn't help overweight kids, they just eat too much, grow up, and eventually they'll be fine.
1791	In fact, most people opposed to gay marriage are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but it will not satisfy them. In addition, the effects on society are likely to be minimal in a highly populated Earth where global warming will significantly reduce the already high taxation of nature's ability to feed us. And if this is really an issue, then the law should not change. We should return to tribalism and slavery, why should it be challenged?
1792	What's wrong if they want a marriage, let them. If they were your child or adopted mother or father, you'd accept it!
1793	I'm going to choose personal pursuit, because I believe that human nature is to care first about oneself.
1794	Our animal instincts are survival, and it's what makes us flinch when we see something approaching us, it's what makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In today's post modern world, our instincts have changed, but they still want to survive.
1795	I used to dream of becoming the greatest pole vaulter I could be, or the best in whatever you were doing. And I learned that pursuing my personal goal was a better thing to do, because it made me a better person.
1796	Well, it's kind of 50/50, I think, and we all need to be less selfish and do things that "help the common good", but on the flip side, we live in a real world and we do things that benefit us.
1797	I'm thinking about personal pursuits, because I think you need to help yourself first to achieve your goals, because how can you help someone if you don't help yourself?
1798	The case is about a convict, he has no legal recourse, he has no legal recourse, but he might be able to do something in civil court, if he has a new car, he should return it back to the court because it will not be worth the trouble.
1799	I think that law enforcement should be given the necessary authority, including the use of force, to perform the duties of the job. I also think that citizens should be more involved in community police. Neighborhood Watch is a good program, and if there are more people doing it, then there will be less demand for police, etc.
1800	I don't think there are any crimes that are victimless, by definition. We might ask why some laws were passed because they seemed to hurt no one, group or society in general, but you need to look at the full extent of their consequences. For instance, prostitution should be legalised and regulated in many European countries, but some aspects, such as working on a street corner, harm the neighbourhood and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in authorised brothels would be appropriate.
1801	Yes, it's illegal in the U.S., but it can be done. The person I know who did it has never had a problem with the medication, in this case, in India, and never had a problem with customs or postal inspectors, etc. I wouldn't recommend this for serious life-threatening diseases, because the quality is probably questionable, but for other medicines, I would have done it if I hadn't lived so close to Mexico, where I could just buy cheap prescription drugs.
1802	Although the previous answers are correct, you should not pay your rent because of the contract, etc., I would advise you not to pay him. He sounds a bit swindler, and if he is a fraud, you will not get your deposit back (typically landlords make up excuses such as cleaning expenses, delapidation etc. in order to keep the money) You will be moving out at the end of December anyway, and he has no power to just throw you out, he will have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal procedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he believed you had caused damage to the property, but it seems that the property is not completely legal, as it is not completely legal.
1803	I've been to Prague, and they're a lot less tight on sex, the local bars have strippers, etc., and you can have an escort arrive at your door in a matter of minutes if you want. I don't think that's the truth, but they're not that bad, I don't think, I found it kind of weird, but I don't like that kind of thing.
1804	It's a matter of belief, a philosophy of life and death that we generally have as children. Sometimes our parents don't teach us the right way, and we decide that the rules our parents have laid down are not right for us. Sometimes our parents don't teach us the right way, and we get into arguments about whether the rules we have set are right or wrong.
1805	Yes, the government already grows it and distributes it to terminally ill patients,and they can tax it to get this country out of the defancy. Besides, how many people die in accidents related to marijuana,one is only going 10 miles per hour, you cannot kill anyone at 10 miles per hour. Besides, Canada has a man named Mark Emery, who is called the Prince of marijuana, he has brought Canada some money in return by selling marijuana seeds, so they don't have any debt. Besides, the U.S.A. wouldn't have as many drug related crimes,and if it would help sick people to ease the pain, then I'm all for it. With the pain Busch and our government have caused us, we need something to help us cope.
1806	In my opinion, guns are bad and should only be used by law enforcement officials and not ordinary citizens. I lost my brother in an accident with a gun, and knowing that anyone nowadays can buy a gun without obtaining a license in some cases makes me feel frustrated and disbelief. I saw a TV news report recently that said that even possessing a fake gun, such as the famous "paint ball guns", can cause serious injury or death, in some cases, when people were accidentally shot by police because they believed they had pointed a real gun at them.
1807	*shakes head in disbelief* Why do people answer questions when they've got absolutely no idea what they're talking about?
1808	I looked at the statute, and it says that the county can seek reimbursement "for any expenses incurred by the county in connection with a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail" as defined in the statute.
1809	If you're interested in legal matters, you'll find that there's a lot of money and power in lawyers. So, yes, lawyers are trying to make you money, but the bottom line is their pocketbook, not yours. So, this is a real catch-22 where both parties can win big, but lawyers assume a lot of risk in civil matters, which in some cases they won't make any money at all if they lose your case. So, before they take on a lot of civil cases, they ask some really important questions, i.e. Is this a profitable case and worth my time? And how much could I make? And, if they do, they will ask some really important questions, i.e. Is this a profitable case and worth my time? And, considering how much I could make? Civil law is still a popular field, but there's a lot of needs for immigration lawyers, so, if you're interested in legal matters, you should consider this.
1810	Civil marriage is not religious, in fact, but the government is in charge of it and therefore has the right and responsibility to define it. I don't think it should do so in such a way that it blatantly discriminates against groups like homosexuals, but it is certainly within its power and responsibility to define marriage.
1811	No, there are many programs designed to help felons get their lives back on track. For instance, you might be able to return to school, depending on your desired field, and get the taxpayers to cover the cost. You should contact your local Department of Public Safety or Public Service Office and they will be able to point you in the direction of the information available. Good luck!
1812	You can see the video here, as well as many others on the subject, and I'm inclined to view them as propaganda. Of course, I'm also inclined to view everything that comes out of the White House on this subject as propaganda.
1813	As everyone knows, terrorists were created by Pakistan, especially those active in India, and now that the present government is trying to bridge the gap between the two nations, the terrorists fear that they will lose their jobs and they are turning against Pakistan now. I think it will take a while to get rid of all the terrorists, if this process continues.
1814	I'd like to add, it's disturbing that so many people think your brother could let the cops in without warrants or reasonable suspicion that someone's life is in danger.
1815	The fact is, "One man, one vote" hasn't been true since the beginning, and it's just more obvious now that our government is really about "one dollar, one vote." That's how a republic works. So save your money and become a member of the syndicate. That's all you need to get. Our government doesn't have power. It's a facade.
1816	It's not like a prize or a package from UPS that you can accept on someone's behalf. A supoena is a very important document sent by the courts, and the person in question is the target, not his dog or girlfriend or his coworkers. By accepting the slip, you made it easy for the server to say he "served" the document to the target person, when in fact he hadn't.
1817	Despite having been told and promised twice that he was supposed to be protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States, he thinks he's doing a lot of other things. If you listen to him speak for a long time, he'll tell you what his job is, usually something like "to lead" or "to say what I'm thinking" or "unite Americans behind a common cause" or some other thing, which he doesn't really know what his job is.
1818	Assuming that such values can be reasonably calculated, I would not have a problem with a law like this being passed by a legislature, since it is in line with the 5th Amendment's Takings Clause, and if the state decides that it wishes to treat towns nice, it cannot be a bad thing. But the only downside is the cost of litigation if a lot of people start sueing towns and counties in order to recover what they think they might have possibly lost, based on what zoning regulations did in another part of town, but that's just a matter of writing the law intelligently and not allowing such legal loopholes.
1819	I don't think it's right, but I know in my heart it's wrong and not an option for me. But I would rather that these women who are determined to have an abortion go to a clean, sterile facility rather than some rusty hut and risk their lives.
1820	In any event, you should ask your lawyer all these questions, because he is supposed to be helping you understand the consequences of accepting any settlement offer.
1821	You'd have gotten angry if you could ask the question "How can the United States FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how to FIND OUT how
1822	It sounds like you need another lawyer and a bail bond agent. First of all, this is enough to charge the lawyer, the notary, your mother and you. Then, add all this up and the crime starts with a felony. This is against the law of the state, the attorney's responsibility, the fraud, the forgery, the ruse. If you want to change this situation, I would be the first one to contact the authorities. The deeds will be recorded in the state, so it's not difficult to find out what happened.
1823	Your "question" is incoherent and consists mainly of opinions expressed as fact. First of all, you should realize that an attorney is a notary. You must have a factual basis before calling someone unethical. You have nothing.
1824	They're usually fine with it, but when a lot of them do get into that situation, they try and say things like "Oh, I don't like the other women, because something happened, so I had an abortion". It's fine with them, but not with the rest of them who don't want to have children.
1825	We have laws on our books that allow our government to fine an illegal alien $250,000, plus incarceration, then deportation. And employers are prohibited from hiring undocumented workers. You're correct. If you or I disobeyed these laws, we would be locked up for years.
1826	It depends on whether the person was sent to a professional in the field where the evaluation took place. In some cases the judge may send the person back for a review, if he or she decides that the evaluation was biased against the person being evaluated. But no, the person cannot be re-evaluated simply to satisfy the wishes of the judge or anyone else.
1827	You must resolve the matter privately and warn them to stop. You must demand that they repay what they stole, not only from you but from your entire family. Do not fall for sob stories. What was her need for the money? Gambling, drugs, etc., and then demand that she be counseled. You must act in a fair manner, especially in relation to your family. Do not get involved with the police if you can. This will only make you appear on Dr. Phil. Change the locks and explain that she is no longer welcome at your home.
1828	Marijuana is a simple natural herb that relaxes, relieves stress, and has many medicinal properties. It is used as fuel for cars, and the oil from the seeds can be used to power motors, so the oil industry, together with the media that profits from the cutting of trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as part of the tax code, so that no one would know that it was restricting the use of marijuana.
1829	I don't think the separation of church and state has anything to do with tax exemption. If a minister preaches, that's fine, but a pastor like Rod Parsley, who's been exposing his political views for years and allows candidates to speak in his pulpit, should lose his tax exempt status immediately. And he's a millionaire a lot of times.
1830	The federal government has no delegated power to make laws on clothing except in those geographical areas under direct federal control. States and localities have the power to make such laws within their jurisdiction. Usually, such laws reflect local perceptions of decency and civility. During the last 30 years, for instance, the majority of people no longer dress formal when they go to church or dine out. Society has come to respect those who wish to dress differently.
1831	I'm not sure, but it's hilarious to me that the UK keeps pouring money into the royal family. Granted, I wouldn't have been so amused if I were British, but since I am not, I'm not.
1832	The problem is, unless they've committed a crime and been convicted, they can't be thrown out of office without a majority vote in the House.
1833	"We'll kill you back if you kill someone in Texas" Ron White--Food for Thought
1834	Theology seems to have a rotten and few fruit; the few theologians who are notable have only produced works of value under the umbrella of philosophical thought. Theologians are often poor philosophers, like Aquinas. Theology is a third rate of philosophy, since it is merely a philosophy with a specific conception of God and scriptural claims. It is *objectively* less likely to reach a correct conclusion than philosophy because of this presupposition. Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics and related subjects are the grounds for legitimate and fruitful discussion of religions.
1835	I'm not sure it's worth living a life of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when it will end. I'd rather live a normal life in the simulation, which, of course, would be a terrible and unpleasant life, but it could also be a happy one, which would be very hard to achieve in the real world. In the end, we're nothing but souls connected to the body, and if my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulation of my brain rather than real experiences, then it'll be fine.
1836	I'm a heterosexual man, and I don't think that everything in the Bible is right. Moreover, if something is wrong, it should be observable and there should be no reason to blame it.
1837	People talk about cosleeping on /r/parenting. We're aware that cosleeping is hazardous, and children roll or fall from beds. Cosleeping also destroys intimacy between parents. It's hard to keep a child away from your bed, but if you keep them there for a long time, then stop them, it'll be much harder later. Basinets aren't a big inconvenience, but they're small enough to fit almost anywhere.
1838	I don't think businesses should be giving discounts to senior citizens and the armed forces, but I wonder if they are getting discounts for the fact that they are 65 years old and doing a job that is more demanding than that? Is it just a way of thanking them? The armed forces are already getting discounts on their taxes free goods on base.
1839	I'm not sure if this will hurt Europe in the long run, but it will help Russia, because it can use this to rein in its corrupt officials and tax skaters. Don't rely on foreign businesses and tax havens, because they will be sanctioned or frozen.
1840	I've always heard about how if we had ignored the World Trade Center, they would have disappeared and dissolved. I don't believe that. They would have been in our history books, despite what people would have wanted, they would have been given enough attention to be included. I don't think we should be blindsided by them. Why not analyze what they believe and find out what makes them tick, so that we can learn from them? They believe in their minds that they are right and we are wrong.
1841	My dad's 28 years older than my mom, who he met when she was 17, and I have half a brother older than my mom. My friend and I had a fight when a 34 year old teacher at our school was sexting a student, and she was sexting back. I didn't realize it was such a big thing, since there were bigger problems in the world and I grew up believing that age wasn't important when it comes to intimacy. Not only was she angry when I said that, but all the girls in the group were angry. Why am I wrong?
1842	I have read the 1972 Limits to Growth study and other popular books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater and others on the problems and limits of capitalism and consumer society. I have recently learned that George Mitchell, the inventor of fracking, had held several conferences in Houston, Texas on the subject of the 1972 Limits to Growth study. I was astonished that a man of such wealth and power would have such strong opinions on the system that had provided him with so much wealth.
1843	First of all, I'm aware that sour cream is already available in a squeezable container, and I think it should be the standard container. It's usually a cup-shaped container with a lid, similar to yogurt. But it's usually better served in a squeeze container, like ketchup or mustard. Yes, sometimes it's more convenient to use a yogurt container, which is easier to scoop, but a lot of the time it's used as a topping, which is much easier to apply with a squeeze of your hand. CMV.
1844	I think teenagers are too young to be driving and they are dangerous when they are driving. They are known for their poor decision making and the increase in texting accidents proves that they cannot operate a car safely.
1845	I'm not a religious person, so I don't think this CMV is biased. I think "Guns don't kill people, People with God kill people" is the same as a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, People *without* God kill people". I think /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and it's as bad as an extreme religious sect.
1846	I don't know why, but I feel that if you make a lot of money doing the worst job in the world, you should be content.
1847	I've been wondering about this lately. Jimmy Page recently interviewed Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to criticize mp3s. But I bet he'd fail as much as anyone else at hearing any difference, at 256 kbps bitrate or higher. He mentioned that the new Led Zeppelin deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all songs. But I still don't like mp3s, at least for home listening. I'm a bit of a snob, probably as much as most people. I like my audiophile equipment a lot. I tend to love original gold CD's or LP's, but my ears probably can't detect much difference. And I love plugging an iPod full of mp3s into my fancy car audio system.
1848	I don't think politicians have the knowledge and know-how to manage a country. We've seen a lot of corruption, bankrupcy all over the world, and a country hasn't been able to maintain a positive economy. Most of the solutions come from an assembly where politicians meet and discuss the solutions, but they don't always implement them. In the early 1900s, a movement called Technocracy was started to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they were managing (e.g. education would be run by someone connected to it who spent most of her life studying education) I think our political system isn't functioning as it should. CMV P.S. I hope I've been clear that English isn't my mother tongue, I hope I've been clear.
1849	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in response to the shootings is taking away from the central point that despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health had been a bigger issue and looked at more closely, the shooting would not have happened. I'm all for feminism, do recognize that women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unnecessary and hurtful.
1850	Hi everyone, after watching the news recently, it seems that the EU's problems are starting to get bigger because of foreign policy issues with Russia. Hearing that some Member States are really watching the elections made me think if Europe could ever be unified, but I don't think it would be a good thing to end the EU.
1851	Why didn't the "real" gods of today's religions want to know about themselves in the Mesopotamian region, would they not have been jealous? If they hadn't been jealous, why had he let men wander around so long in worship of "false gods"?
1852	All problems are caused by miscommunication, because drivers do not know what other drivers are doing, and it turns into gossip because someone did not take the time to tell the full story. For instance, fighting occurred between two people who did not know the rules of a game properly, and they blew people up because the government did not listen to their concerns in the first place. There are many more needs I will go on.
1853	Welfare cuts incentives for the lower classes to rise because it makes them content in their place. It means higher taxes, lower spending and lower profits. It means paying for the new television of the neighbours. It means paying for the overweight who didn't know anything better than to eat at McDonalds every day.
1854	The drinking age should be 16. Anecdotal evidence shows that in countries where casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age, there is a significantly lower incidence of diseases and deaths. If the drinking age is integrated into society, it can significantly reduce binge drinking when a person reaches the age of 18, 19, or 21. Furthermore, these extra years of sales can increase taxes and fund programs to help those suffering from alcoholism recover.
1855	I've been following this forum for a while now, and I'm guessing you meant excitement. I was never really fond of this color, and when I was a kid, it seemed to me that blood and murder were the colors. But as I got older, I started to appreciate it more. Yellow just reminds me of the sun, which makes me happy, but red is much more striking and maybe exciting.
1856	I don't think it's a bad thing to have sex at a young age, but it's something else.
1857	Man always has the freedom to do what he wishes, but not what he should do. Adam had the choice between good and evil, and he chose evil. This choice had damaged his relationship with God and had created a bad world. Now man still has the freedom to do what he wishes, but not what he should do.
1858	I'm forced to admit that humans are a bit different from the rest of the animals, but I don't see how this makes them superior.
1859	This is a call to action in the UK to end the government's big brother program. London's Westimister Council is merely exacerbated the problem of people not trusting the government and their surveillance of British people by removing something that most people love and want to keep. In addition, Banksy has turned what was once a dull, uninteresting wall into something interesting, interesting and moving. He is an honored artist and Westimster Council should recognise this as a present that should not be discarded but used.
1860	In Status Quo, children are now experiencing the wrong meaning of Christmas because a recent survey shows that most children see Christmas as a gift day or a day when you get whatever you want from your parents, which should not be the case. The meaning of Christmas is supposed to be Christ's birth, and when Santa Claus is introduced, children and even now adults see Santa Claus as a Christmas symbol and he is no longer seen as Christ. It is like a birthday party, where everyone pays attention to another person instead of the birthday boy or girl, so it is clearly wrong.
1861	I agree that legalising Performing Enhancers is an obsurd idea. Performing Enhancers are harmful to the body, and it is in the best interest of the government to protect the players' health because they are too young to see the consequences. Moreover, these athletes are role models for many young children. Do you want children pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending to have breasts? These athletes will encourage the use of steroids for younger children because their favorite athletes are using them.
1862	The Germans had been the world's biggest superpower, advanced scientific and military projects, new shock wave military tactics, and much stronger than Japan. Japan had been fighting in the jungles with smaller bands, and their ships had been stopped pretty quick. Only their loyalty to the Emperor had stopped the entire country surrendering a couple of years earlier.
1863	Well, it's a very contentious matter, much more sensitive than most people who don't come from Canada would think. But the French nationalists aren't against his performance for artistic reasons, which they would have made very right, but for nationality, when he's really trying to celebrate the history of a significant place. Frankly, I believe that the most appropriate way to celebrate Quebec City's "birthday" would be to build a huge statue of Canada's father, General Wolfe, on the plains of Abraham!
1864	Oh, that's hard, very hard. They're two of my two favourite bands, but I think Queen will win because their anthems "We Will Rock You, We Are Champions" will live on for a long time. And their music has a wider spectrum of themes and ideas. Pearl Jam is good, but they're not as good as Queen.
1865	The government can determine which groups and organisations are most important for a particular precinct, so that precious tax dollars are not diverted into something that barely anyone cares about, and more money is diverted into things that matter to the people.
1866	Ocarina of Time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were enjoyable to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT, but OoT stands above MM. We're talking about what most people consider to be the finest video game ever made. OoT has made Zelda series into a 3D world, and it has a huge world to explore and a fascinating story.
1867	I'm not sure I'd be willing to take the risk if I were to find myself in that position, but I'd be willing to consider it. If I were suffering from early onset Alzheimer's or some other kind of mental decline, I would consider ending my life.
1868	The average US teacher's salary is $32,000, and the average US teacher's salary is $53,000. In Wisconsin, the salary is $75,000. 4.5 billion are spent on teachers' salaries and 1.6 billion on their ridiculous salaries. I think that's a big sum for someone to get, especially since all the mediocre teachers are practically impossible to dismiss.
1869	Why do we still think Einstein's view of the universe is correct, because he feels that all matter warps space-time, but that doesn't make him right. Think about it, get ready... this is the theory. All matter sucks. Basically! This theory says that all matter sucks space-time and that all other matter just seems to attract, like the "ultimate sagging mattress" that's often mentioned. There are many flaws in this theory, but it's not just wrong.
1870	We have one of the strongest navies on earth, and we've got 366 military vessels in the vicinity of this dangerous area. And we have 4 military vessels that are in danger of pirate attacks, and they're a thousand nautical miles long. So why can't the world's strongest navy spare a couple of other ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather let the 4 ships remain there and hope that no more ships are hijacked?
1871	There's no disagreement, but I disagree. There's a good chance that the United States and Iran will have a war or conflict, and that's why they hate the West and support terrorist organizations. And if a terrible attack happens in the next couple of years, Iran is the target. And there's a good chance that Israel's interests are America's interests, and that's why we need to be careful.
1872	We agreed that this was the best sushi we'd ever had, and he'd add, "And I've had a lot of sushi." Seriously, don't go to the many overpriced restaurants in Vegas or the deep fried cream cheese rolls. Go to Boulder City and eat there. It's worth the price of a rental car.
1873	I've got a business on Craig Street, and sometimes I have to eat the food there. Yesterday was the day. The people were so rude, I didn't even see eye to eye. The food I got wasn't good enough for my dog.
1874	I had a great dinner here, the food was great, the staff was very helpful and kind, and I'm very happy.
1875	Slow service, too expensive chairs, weird chairs with wheels. I ordered a Sashimi selection that was fine, but not worth the price. Also, a beef noodle dish, very mediocre, a tiny amount of beef with huge lumps of tofu. Wine was $13 a glass. We ate there with 6 people, not too much extravagant, 2 wines, 2 beers $174 before tip.
1876	I don't often go to Jack in the Box, but I haven't really had a bad experience here. The service is terrible. I went here twice this past week and it took me about 15 minutes to get a jumbo jack. It wasn't busy, but today it took me three minutes to get my order and it wasn't even busy. The bosses should think about retraining their staff. Five guys will continue to dominate my business over you, because they seem to be doing it faster than you and they're walking in the burger joint.
1877	The place was very nice and a good place to have a date. The menu was a bit confusing because it was Italian, but the waiter was very helpful. I got the seafood linguine, which was recommended by the waiter as a popular dish. The food took quite a while to arrive, but we received free bread with olive oil, but it was quite hard and dry, so I did not really like it. When we got the food, we were quite disappointed in the portion because it was expensive for the small portion we received. We easily demolished the noodles in 5 minutes and felt hungry even after spending around $25. The noodles themselves were very tasty and flavorful, but they added cheese on top, but they were not worth the price, so I would not come back again due to the high price and the small portion.
1878	I've never been to a buffet that didn't have much flavor, the selection was tiny, the salads were wilted, the gravy had a sour taste, the "roast beef" was a size of my fist, and they cut two thin slices of paper for you. It was also very expensive, $19 on Tuesday night.
1879	In my opinion, school uniforms are very comfortable, because there is a gap between rich and poor, and school uniforms are effective in many ways. If they wear ordinary clothes every day, they are interested in the brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible, so he or she feels inferior. Moreover, school uniforms are very expensive, but they are cheaper than ordinary clothes.
1880	We're talking about how schools destroy creativity, and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools where they have uniforms, students sometimes have a day off when they dress casually, but are then given strict guidelines on what is acceptable. This effectively makes the dress of a casual person a twisted "causal" uniform.
1881	When they're young and trying to find themselves, there's no need to lose their independence. I vote against them.
1882	I don't think school uniforms are a good idea, because it takes too much work to wash them and it's painful when you have to put on so much stuff in the morning.
1883	Of course, Firefox, and I'm fond of this site, but I'm not sure how clear it is.
1884	The important advantage is that, when I need a very powerful SEO extension, I can easily modify FF to suit my new needs.
1885	Firefox has extensions created by users that serve the user community, so it's winning
1886	No, I wouldn't turn my wife in, I'd just be like. You said I had a part to play, and we'd be going our separate ways, but really, I wouldn't want to know at all.
1887	No, I would not have told him, for I do not know what reason he might have had for killing the man, or perhaps it might have been for self defense, as we all know, and if people ask me about anything, I do not know anything. I have faith in him, and I would not have let him go because of any reason, and his secret is safe with me.
1888	I don't know if I would have turned him in for murder, but my feelings would have been stronger than the fear of having a bad husband. I don't know exactly what I would have done, but I'm sure I wouldn't have looked at him every day and said nothing had happened. I don't think I'd have done anything to make him feel like he was going to be put to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
1889	If it's the person you're really fond of, and you'd like to spend the rest of your life with, then it's definitely not. People make mistakes, but if I wanted to spend the rest of my life with the person I'd most like, I wouldn't turn in them. And if I wanted to spend the rest of my life with the person I'd most like, and I'd never turn in them, then it's definitely not.
1890	Books are always superior to television because they're filled with knowledge.
1891	Well, books are better than television, because television makes your eyes bad, and kills your imagination. Read "The Television" by Roald Dhal, and you'il understand everything!
1892	I don't think India can replace developed countries like the U.S., London and other countries because most people here are ill, so I don't think India can.
1893	I think it's better not to have a bad father than to have a bad father.
1894	I'm not sure how it feels to be without a father, but I have friends whose fathers are always drinking and they don't do anything for them. They sometimes say they wish their father wasn't around. Now, if my dad was like that, I would have thought the same thing, because if he wasn't around, he wouldn't have known how it feels to be disappointed.
1895	Raffles had envisaged a city plan for Singapore which would include separate areas for ethnic groups and a provision for other facilities such as roads, schools and land for government buildings in October 1822.
1896	When Raffles sacked Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, it was because he had taken measures which Raffles did not approve of. I think that he had taken measures which were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him in the interest of the Singaporeans.
1897	It's as if your cat or dog were trying to understand your income tax return, evolution and creation are inseparable!
1898	Did man evolve in history, I must have missed that.
1899	Our world might be a giant hologram http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html It's extremely likely that we live in a simulated universe
1900	I used to use FireFox, but I've got only 2 gigabytes of RAM on my machine and I like using more than one program at a time. FireFox wastes too much memory for the sake of justifying the benefits of one or two advantages.
1901	Yes, both students and teachers will benefit from physical education, provided they are taught and encouraged properly and with the correct attitude.
1902	If we don't start with a young age, how can we reduce childhood obesity?
1903	It is my opinion that physical education should be compulsory in school, because it is good for students to become healthy people and thus avoid the risk of obesity.
1904	He had gained the affection and respect of the people when he had been dismissed. Thousands of people had gathered on the day he had left Singapore to say goodbye to Farquhar.
1905	William Farquhar had stayed in Singapore longer than Raffles, so he had more time to get to know the people, build up their confidence, find out what problems they were having and solve them.
1906	So you're saying that if a woman gets an abortion right afterward, it'll be okay?
1907	Now, in my querido idioma, I'm saying, "No es más que una planta, menos, me atrevera a decir Lo nico que hace es chupar recursos, al igual que la planta, aunque la plantas nos dan oxgeno...no hayamos olvido en el aborto, pero no hayamos olvido en el aborto, pero no hayamos olvido en el aborto, el aborto es matar un parásito
1908	It is not about what you choose, it is about who decides.
1909	I'm choosing pro-choice because I'm allowed to choose life, and if I choose life, I'm not allowed to choose.
1910	The Big Bang Theory is a term that describes the explosion of molecules that began the creation of the Universe.
1911	It is no more wrong than any other expression used for exploitation.
1912	Pornography is fine, except for the kind of pornography that is disgusting, such as child, animal or rape, but other pornography is fine, provided it is watched discreetly.
1913	Usually, my decision is either yes or no, or both. But today, it's progressing for the common good. Taking a better decision for your own good, will help you at the moment, but in the long run, who will really benefit from it? Whereas, if you do something for the common good, you'll help yourself and other people.
1914	Personally, I believe that the advancement of the common good is more important than any other thing. I'm not sure how to back this up, but I feel that way. I guess it's because I'm not a selfish person, I believe in helping others. And I'll sacrifice 9 times out of 10 times what I have to sacrifice for the good of the common good.
1915	Who's to get rid of the Catholic schoolgirl outfits?
1916	It's a good idea, because it's impossible to have a race for fashion among students. Let's say one student is richer than another, and he starts showing his wealth before the poorer one. This will create a bad atmosphere at school, and it could start a fight between two students. Usually, it happens between girls, but it's not uncommon between boys.
1917	I think school uniform is a good idea, because there's a gap between rich and poor, so it's effective in many ways. If they wear ordinary clothes every day, they care about the brand and quantity of clothes. Teenagers are sensible, so they don't feel inferior. School uniform is expensive, but it's better than ordinary clothes.
1918	Yes, it's nice to have a uniform at school, because it represents the goal of the school: I used to wear a white shirt and a blue skirt at school, and it symbolized peace and loyalty in the relationship. Moreover, the uniform eliminates the barrier of status, demonstrating that all children are treated equally under one roof.
1919	You know, maybe your bad father could teach you something more than nothing. Maybe he could teach you how not to be, how not to behave, how not to treat your family. And that would be better than nothing, I think, to teach you how not to behave.
1920	Plastic bottles make up to 1.5 million tons of waste per year, and the production requires up to 47 million gallons of oil per year. Moreover, even though the plastic used in the bottles is of high quality and in demand from recycling plants, over 80% of the plastic bottles used in drinks are thrown away.
1921	I'm fond of TV, TV is nice, TV is nice, TV is like a child in my womb, the sun in the morning, the cool, fresh air on your first day at school, the day you get diagnosed with cancer, the day you realize you've wasted your time reading this.
1922	Plastic is light and good for diaphragms.
1923	It's definitely wrong, and realistically, it's about the man and the woman, that's one way of saying that they reproduce.
1924	For the record, I'm not a homosexual, I'm married and have a daughter.
1925	From a biological point of view, men and women were "engineered" to be together, but this idea has been corrupted by morality and society of our time.
1926	It's not ethical to do something if society as a whole benefits from it. In fact, we'd all be extinct if we didn't have a gay marriage.
1927	India is surrounded by water from three sides, something that most nations do not have.
1928	India is moving forward with the concerns of other countries saying that India is moving forward with the world power.
1929	Christianity is at odds with historical, archaelogical, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational and impartiality. Its teachings are full of contradictions, and the arguments against it are weak (with the exception of a couple of exceptions, which are quite close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more sensible of the two.
1930	The difference between religion and science is that science admits that it doesn't have all the answers, while religion is so dogmatic that it doesn't even recognize facts and what really means truth.
1931	The most important reason to consider any given deity unreasonable is that it is possible to replace it with one who lies to humanity about literally everything it says, and we would not be wiser. And that's just the beginning.
1932	I never did the same thing twice after I was spanked, so I'd spank my kids for love and my butt.
1933	Yes, because it's a way of teaching a child not to do it again, because it hurts, and I know that from experience.
1934	Yes, I think you should spank a child only when he realizes what he is doing. The child will understand better if he fears doing the same mistake again.
1935	Faith is one of the key ingredients in Christianity, and it's not just because you can't see it, it doesn't mean it's not there.
1936	I'm in love with Jesus, so I'm in it.
1937	I'm assuming that everyone on this side of the argument was raised in a Christian household, grow a pair and ask yourself why I worship a man who wears straggly sandals.
1938	Why are we fighting? The scientologists are raging right now and we must unite to fight them.
1939	I don't think spanking should be compulsory, it's just a minute, but punishing can last for two or three weeks or more.
1940	No, 'cause we're going to make our kids feel that we don't love them.
1941	No, I don't think they should be spanked because, in my opinion, it doesn't work. Maybe once in a while, but as they grow up, it's not the right thing to do, because you won't have a good relationship and the relationship won't grow.
1942	It's not all about violence, parents shouldn't hit kids for discipline, only if it's necessary.
1943	I don't agree that parents should use spaking as an option of disciplining because children won't fear what their parents are planning for them, and also because if you do that to your children, they'll learn what their parents are teaching them, and also because it won't help them much.
1944	I would have said yes under certain circumstances, but not under others. If my husband killed a person for self defense or for the protection of another person, then I would not turn him in. If he killed a person for killing someone or something like that, then I would not turn him in. If he killed a person with cold heart, rape, money, objects, or simply disgust, then I would not turn him in.
1945	Yes, I'd turn my wife in, who knows if they killed once, they'll kill again? Who knows if they'll kill you again if they start paranoid about you being caught?
1946	Murder is wrong, no matter what. The person who does it knows the consequences and knows he is guilty. I would not have looked at my wife the way I did before. I would not have survived the secret of murder.
1947	We're not the ones who brought this child life, we're not the ones who gave it life, why should we be the ones who killed it? We don't have the authority to do that.
1948	I've been told once that "life is a choice" by Reagan, and I've been wondering if he's right.
1949	We should all be fine with ITTT, as long as it's not disease!
1950	Isn't it stated in the declaration of independence that we have the right to life, liberty and happiness?
1951	I think it's more important to pursue a personal interest because each person is responsible for his or her actions, and it would make it easier for one or two people not to do the same thing as you would if you were working for the same thing.
1952	It's better to help yourself first, for instance, if you don't have a job and you live with your mother and you don't have any money and you want to help them by giving to an organization, you can't.
1953	It's human nature to pursue personal pleasures, and if you assume that human nature is to advance the common good, you'll be screwed by someone who pursues personal pleasures.
1954	Yes, it's illegal. The consequences will be you and your friend going around the house and picking up the garbage. Like when you used to use toilet paper. A couple of years ago when I was a kid, my brother and I were drawing on people's garage doors with chalk. It was a long story, but we were caught and had to clean up all the garages. Have fun.
1955	You see, when the Nazis came to power, they banned private possession of firearms. There was a reason; they wanted to get rid of the door and take people away without due process.
1956	You've got a great question, and ideals only work in ideal worlds. In our real world, it's much more probable that a poor person will be convicted of a crime than a rich one. Thus, when an EX-felon is denied the right to vote, poor communities are denied equal representation.
1957	No, the tenant still has to pay the rent, but if the landlord does not repair the damage, the tenant can do the following: Take the rent when it is due to the local court. The tenant must be current on the rent deposit, and the court may order the landlord to repair the damage, or give the tenant some of the rent money to pay for the repairs. End the lease. Cancel the rental agreement and move.
1958	Even though adultery may be against the law where you live, and even though you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is a distorted anger. This woman did not come into your house, your husband invited her, she did not have sex with him, he did not have sex with her, and she did not have children. Your husband did not have children.
1959	It depends on the contract, I suppose. You might have to agree to the fact that you want the design changed, or you might be allowed to demand that it be changed. Most likely, you'll have to pay anyway. But it might be better to deal with the problem through your "legal recourse." If you haven't done so, you should tell the designer how unhappy you are and why, and ask him to make the design changes. It might be in the designer's interest to see that his customers are pleased with the design in the long run.
1960	It's just that the word was used by some people as an insult, and that's all that matters.
1961	It's just that a lot of people live in a tiny part of Manhattan, and most other cities that are more spread out clean up less frequently.
1962	All right, huh, he's an adult, and I'm thinking you're a minor? First of all, he shouldn't have put you in a criminal situation in the first place. Obviously, he didn't care enough about you to avoid you being arrested, so I'd let him sit there and think about what he did. If he's any good, he should be the one who apologizes to you.
1963	No,I don't think so,not in a civilised society. I guess you're asking me about the impending verdict on Saddam Hussein. If he's sentenced to capital punishment,I think there'll be more violence,hatred,and bloodshed. For serious crimes,I believe a life sentence in prison is the proper punishment. I don't see how killing someone solves anything.
1964	I think it's the fact that some people's brain development isn't complete at the age of 18, which makes it more dangerous for an 18-year-old to drink.
1965	Yes, and they need to be reduced now that the CPS in my state is destroying families without any real evidence of any kind. They're doing the children more harm than good by ripping them out of families without any explanation, keeping them apart from their families, and basically terrorizing everybody, even the kids. I've seen a lot of families destroyed, my son's among them, and there's no way of dealing with them except to let them play their God games and bow down every time.
1966	I don't know of any specific court cases where the real rapist was convicted.
1967	Many of these answers refer to the woman's right to decide what will happen to her body, but what about the child's? He wouldn't have chosen anything. "I think I want to be partially conceived, (at a time when I could live outside my mother's body), stabbed in the head and brain sucked out. How selfish are the women who think it's all about them and what they need or want?
1968	Is it possible, yes, it depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge. A lot of federal courts require people with cell phones, pagers, blackberries, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service, if the judge has a policy against such things in his courtroom, whether it's on or off. But I've personally seen a person's phone confiscated because of concern that he was trying to photograph witnesses with it in a drug case.
1969	It sounds a bit sloppy, and if you're building an extension without the proper foundations, and if you're building it without the proper permission, it's not legal. The letter you're writing should be about helping them sell a house which has parts that could collapse in a storm and possibly get hurt, but rather about saying that the building has only been built for the time it has been built and that it has to be examined because there are no proper foundations. If you're deliberately writing an incorrect statement and the truth comes out, then you could be accused of aiding and abetting an illegal sale, and you should avoid the whole thing altogether or contact the local authorities. The agent should also be informed about the problem, because he's in real trouble.
1970	I think we would all find these laws much less distasteful if we were honest and said them to be illegal because we as a society do not want to bear the costs of medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior.
1971	You cannot export Democracy by force, because it takes the will of the people to form such a government. Islam does not have the Enlightenment background we had in the beginning United States, and demands that the state and church be one with the Koran as the rule of law. Despite the efforts of some right wing conservative religious types, America has a wall of separation between religion and government where citizens can follow their conscience.
1972	My wife was severely abused as a child, and we're happy with our marriage and she's an excellent wife and partner. So, the answer is yes, but it takes patience and understanding. As for your trouble, I wish you the best of luck in finding the love you've always dreamed of, and it's possible to do so for over 50 years. But if you don't believe in the person you love, then you're going to have to go on. Lies don't belong in a relationship.
1973	I have had to deal with custody battles many times in my work, and it's never a happy path.
1974	Please note that there are a lot of illegal immigrants in our prisons and jails, for murder, drug smugggling and stealing, because they crossed the border illegally. Without a system, anyone can come in, no matter how sick or criminal.
1975	It's a bit of a waste of time and egotistical to do this. The idea is that we collect information from different points of view and then let others decide the value of that information. That's not what this website is about, and it's unethical. It's probably against Yahoo!'s rules, too. I don't know how anyone feels that they've won by voting on their own answer, it's so silly.
1976	The Supreme Court has already ruled that abortion should be legal, because the person's First Amendment right to privacy concerning what happens to his body is not about when life begins, etc., but about the freedoms and constitution of this great country, which protects us against our personal self.
1977	In reply to another person's answer, if cigarettes were legal, it would save countless lives and hospitals thousands of patients suffering from smoking-related cancer. I don't think it's a loss of money, it'd only save lives and money. Besides, the cigarette industry deserves to collapse, I'd love to see it collapse, not teachers, doctors, firefighters, those who support legalization of cigarettes.
1978	It is my belief that the two issues are really two separate questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. The fact that Brown v. Board overturned the previous SCOTUS decision on "equal but separate" is a testament to the success of the integration of America as a whole, not only in the education system, but also in the social and economic context. However, the spirit of the law is still lacking, mainly due to the geography and the financial constraints.
1979	You should be excused or rescheduled if you have posted here. I was summoned and dismissed twice for not being in the city at the time.
1980	Yes, in North Carolina, you have to wait three days to buy a gun after you've spent time off work taking a mandatory firearms safety course, going to the sheriff's office, filling out the necessary forms, and then you've got to submit an application for a gun. But in the meantime, you could buy whatever you want from a street corner in one day and be done. The criminals have it made here. Why do they make honest people go through so much to get a gun? I know other states are even more difficult to deal with. New York is the hardest of them.
1981	I'm afraid the main problem with trust is that the justice system is not working very well, and people are sitting in jail for 15 years for crimes that have no penalty. And you can commit the same crime in two places, one gets probation and the other gets 20 years. I think that until these problems are resolved, people will not believe that our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone.
1982	You should contact the business and inform them of the incident and ask them to pay you a reasonable amount for the damages (in this case, a doctor's bill plus $1000). You should consider speaking with the lawyer only if they refuse and your damages exceed your state's maximum small claims award by $1000. If you are not injured and have been properly treated, your case is weak. The damages for pain and suffering in this case will be approximately $1000 unless you can prove the incident was caused by negligence or malice. If you hire an attorney, it is likely that you will not have enough money left to pay the bill for your treatment.
1983	I've lived in Texas for over 30 years and I've never heard a complaint about illegal aliens until the last few weeks when the media started blazing them out.
1984	Legally yes, and it has happened. The reality is that men like sex, and if they are not in a relationship they have little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. A man weak enough to be "raped" would be a laughingstock. The most likely scenario would be a drug used to rape a man, and the man contracting an STD from it. Especially a married or engaged man.
1985	I heard about it on the news this morning. It is my opinion that he has a choice whether or not to perform the act which resulted in the child. It does not matter whether he is using birth control or not. The fact that he is not using any contraception is not a problem. The fact that he has a baby is not a problem, but it is a matter of whether he has a choice.
1986	Thong-Wearing Men Arrested at Walmart Thu Jul 29,10:59 AM ET AP SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. - Two men who were arrested for walking through a Walmart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "triple-dog dare," authorities said. The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pairs of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. They were arrested for public indecency and disorderly conduct. When asked why they were wearing thong underwear, one of the men said a friend "triple-dog dared" them.
1987	If you think it's necessary, yes, but will you still be able to work and earn your own income? These semi truck drivers have insurance, some of them have million dollar insurance, but not all of them go after the company they drive for. They probably feel guilty about it every day.
1988	You must be certain that the facts are correct before you write your paper. The press sells papers exaggerating the facts. Guantanamo was an excellent example. The prisoners were humiliated, but they were not tortured.
1989	I'll be moving to Singapore in the next couple of months and I've discovered that their income tax rates are much lower than the US, and they have high luxury taxes on things like cars and brand names. A lot of my employees are moving to other Asian countries because their tax burden is too high, especially in Europe.
1990	In my view, the main controversy is whether abortion involves killing another human being or not. To answer this question, we need to define legally what being alive means. I propose that brain activity is the measure of being alive since it is the brain that determines our sentience. Thus, if a fetus does not show any signs of brain activity, it is not a living human being and can be legally aborted. This definition does not involve religious or ethical concerns, which makes the abort issue much easier to solve.
1991	I think suicide is a stupid thing to do, if you're willful enough to think about or even act on it. It doesn't really make sense to take your life and live it, when you're so capable of doing it. Suicide isn't an option I think is necessary, and a person who commits it is stupid.
1992	I don't mean that students should be placed in different grades, but rather, they should be placed in classes based on their ability level.
1993	I'm sorry, I won't answer every reply, I have a lot of work to do.
1994	I think that if a website has something important to include, it should be easy to find in the main content and not in the FAQ section.
1995	Especially since it's shunned by everyone if someone other than a dark colored person uses the word, it becomes something that only one race can use, and that's racist. If I'm being too vague, you can ask me questions. I'm aware that **censorship** is related to my question and is a **wholly different** debate. I'd like to know why my opinion that using the word is wrong and not **how** implementing a censorship would work.**
1996	I've seen a lot of movies, and it seems to me that when the movie is over, people in the audience start clapping. I don't understand it, because nobody involved in its making can hear the clapping. But it does make sense for a special screening, premiere, or a guest appearance by a movie star, but it doesn't make sense for a normal moviegoing situation. Please change your mind, so that I don't get annoyed when the theater is full of people clapping.
1997	The world is a chaotic system, and literally every choice you make, even the smallest, is part of your destiny, so the choices you make as adults are the product of how the world treats you as a child, and the seemingly meaningless, everyday choices we make through the butterfly effect are more important than the ones that seem meaningful in the present.
1998	Point 1: testing is the only effective means of objective measurement and is necessary to assess whether the system is functioning properly. Point 2: education changes over time and requires constantly changing curriculum and methods to prepare students for modern life. Point 3: teachers must continue to learn these new methods and changing curriculum in order to effectively lead the learning process. Point 4: standard testing prior to each school year would allow teachers to be relocated where they are most effective, or eliminated altogether if they are no longer effective in leading the learning process. Point 5: high performing teachers could be paid more if they were removed from the labour pool.
1999	I don't think you can make a statistical argument that aliens exist if you only have one example of life on a planet. If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for instance, you might conclude that life probably evolves at least twice in a galaxy. Or, if you had an example of the closest star with planets, you might conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life. But if you only have one example, how would you use it to estimate the distribution of life in the universe? It could be once per universe, once per galaxy, or once per hundred stars, and it would look like the same.
2000	* Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles at Israel in the past two weeks, despite Israel's repeated attempts to cease fire without retaliation. * Hamas has refused and ignored these opportunities of peace, leaving Israel with no option but to retaliate. * Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by shooting missiles at civilian buildings.
2001	Since my apartment is on the 3rd floor, I keep my bike outside. My bike was stolen 3 weeks ago, and it was stolen again last night. I'm very angry now. I don't want to spend another 80 euros on a new bike, I don't want to buy a cheap one that was obviously stolen, I don't want to finance these fuckin' shits. It seems like the best option left is to start stealing bikes on my own, why shouldn't I? Please add a better option.
2002	With how the world is coming close to annihilating itself because of leaders who are a bit triggered (Cuban Missile Crisis), I really believe nuclear weapons are the sole reason the world is not in a major conflict right now. For instance, the Cold War. If the US and the Soviets didn't have their nuclear arsenal, what would Stalin, Khruschev, etc. have done without attacking the rest of Europe? They would have easily done so, and the US couldn't have done much to stop them. Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.
2003	I've read countless discussions on the use of the burqa and other clothing intended to conceal Muslim women, but I don't think anyone realizes how the West treats the breasts. Women in most places must conceal their breasts publicly, websites consider them nudity and cut them off, and even if it's legal, they don't like to see it. How is it different than preventing women from showing their faces or legs? I invite you to CMV.
2004	I've heard the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of the Detroit N*****s, and I don't know if it's racist, but it's not.
2005	People who don't know anything about it usually don't like it, they think it's a form of hooliganism and associated with immatureness, and they don't like it at all. Somebody wouldn't even consider it a sport, but I think it's an art form, because it's * fundamentally creative, everyone has their own style * an artistic rebellion against the dull, boring cityscape that many people grow up in, and it takes what someone else is just a ledge and makes it something fun and creative. If you're more in favor of the right of the corporations to take over public space with art than you are of the desire of people to revolt against that with art, then you should understand that I don't expect to change your mind about it, and you won't change mine by saying it's illegal, but if you like street art, you should appreciate skateboarding at some level.
2006	I don't mean that there aren't legitimate injuries, or fouls should not be punished, I just say that soccer is full of liars and I don't like it.
2007	I'm not sure anyone ever 'asks to be raped', but I think if you dress like a whore you increase your chances of being raped. And I think that dressing *nicer* clothes would stop rape, but it couldn't hurt. This is my current view. I'm not stubborn, so I want people to change their minds. I just haven't been convinced. My reply is always, 'why put yourself in that position'.
2008	Currently, I am curious and possibly wondering about the perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (yes, I am an American) consider bad, my mind tends to Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say, "Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. Thanks
2009	Gravity is a theory, so it should not be taught in schools because it is not absolute. A theory, as science details, is not a law, and we should not teach our children speculative notions about the world as fact.
2010	Quick summary: Religion, based on zero evidence and abstract ideas, attacks the intelligence and mental development of human beings. From birth to adulthood, a person is capable of comprehending the values Earth and Physics has to offer unless it is blocked by religion (Parents, Priests, Churches, Media, etc.) If it is easily convinced, he is at high risk of losing the ability to think intelligently in that sense.
2011	For too long, our politicians have ignored illegal immigrants, who are robbing our country of jobs, and who steal our money to pay for their children's education and emergency care. They steal our money and they steal our money. Their very status should say it all -- illegal.
2012	The tennis scene is the most hilarious 15 seconds in any Wes movie (with the exception of Future Man's "You Look Like a Banana" in Bottle Rocket) and it's not even close to being comparable.
2013	Married life= everything is in place, stability for the rest of your life, a partner who loves and adores you so much that he will make a lifetime commitment to you, respect from family and friends, and happiness (otherwise why would you get married at all?) Single life, in general, is lonely, immature, selfish, ignorant, and stuck in the memory of the 8th grade class dance! While I understand that this varies from person to person, I believe there is more respect for a couple who truly learns the true beauty of life (trust, mutual respect, lifelong commitment to another human being)
2014	A shotgun would have to be loaded and fired, a chainsaw would have to be pulled, I would have to go down the block turning around in the circle of undead carnage. (Although, if there were only a couple of zombies, the shotgun would have the advantage of range.)
2015	To be fair, the belief in evolution implies the necessity of belief in the extinction of some species, which is not the most beautiful thing in the world, but is part of the package. And while humans have a moral obligation to limit their impact on the natural world, are we doing more now than any species has before, or should we save every single one of them, however unsuitable?
2016	I guess it depends on what you're listening to, but I'll use Pink Floyd's dark side of the moon as an example. TBH, and I'm sure I'm going to be crucified for this, I have to say that listening to it with speakers on it sounds really thin and uneasy, while when I use headphones I really feel the fullness and scope of Wallace's phycalic epic. But, as I said, it depends on the album, I suppose!
2017	It's hard to say that we haven't caught or killed Osama Bin Laden. Yes, it would've been a great achievement, but removing Bin Laden from the world would've done nothing for stopping terrorists, even Islamic terrorists in Indonesia.
2018	It's all about the genre, I prefer PC gaming for FPS, RTS, MMORPGs, and racing games, because I'm much more comfortable with the mouse and keyboard than the controller, and the steering wheel and gadgets make the racing games much more enjoyable than the controller. But, it seems that the console controllers, side scrollers, action RPGs, RPGs, sports, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.,
2019	It's just a cool debate: the death penalty is against the Eighth Amendment, retribution is another word for vengeance, and the defendants are usually not the worst offenders, but rather the ones with the least resources for defense. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence has emerged, proving mistakes have been made.
2020	The issue of Muslim integration in Britain is currently a problem. The issue is that if Islam is allowed to operate a parallel legal system in Britain, there will be no way to prevent Christianity from running such a system. It is a classic situation for many parents; you cannot give a child and not expect that the other child will want the same thing. In the end, there will be a whole spectrum of different legal systems in Britain, which is illegal and totally unnecessary.
2021	Cats, definitely. They're independent. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities because they can't do it on their own. They're not always happy like dogs, almost to the point where they're too stupid to know the difference. "They make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do" Jack Burns from "Meet the Parents"! There's no cleaning of the lawn, no walking of a dog and cleaning their poop, no loud barking in the middle of the night, no slobbering, no puppies peeing on the floor, etc., etc. Cats are adorable creatures, but dogs are...well, dogs!
2022	The operation Eagle Claw was not a success because the desert conditions caused damage to most of the helicopters trying to rescue American prisoners held in the US Embassy in Iran, not because of poor planning or incompetence of the military or administration.
2023	It's too much a blanket statement, just being a "dictator" isn't a reason to get rid of, much less eliminate a so-called dictator. Who decides who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees that a nation's leader is a dictator, why assaniate him? There have been "beneficial" dictators, but also evil non-dictators.
2024	I must admit that I have not read the other three books on the list and therefore cannot give my opinion on this alone.
2025	To all those who doubted it, you're right, no building in human history has ever had steel frames burnt to earth, and it must have been that hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that collapsed, completely unconnected to it, must have collapsed because of that, I'm sure.
2026	I don't mean we should be English, but there should be one official language we use to talk. We could do business much better, understand everyone, and communicate ideas better. The Internet has given us all the ability to communicate, but now it's just a matter of having one official language.
2027	We've got something against non-Christians here? People are voting against me, a non-Christian, opening my shop in order to appeal to all my clients who believe that Christmas Day is a time of needing something small.
2028	I've been to Butterblume for the first time today and I've been pleasantly surprised. The place is very lively and has a very nice acoustics. The food is very unusual and varied, with interesting textures and tastes and textures. I've had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad and the frittata with tuna for the main course and both were excellent. The acoustics are very good and the place is very clean.
2029	This place is a dumpy neighborhood bar, with lots of noisy kids, and decent food. The service isn't great, but the food is really good.
2030	All right, I lived in Austin from 2000 to 2007 and I loved their brisket and sauce, the fact that they had a gas station set up and the fact that they advertise themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to Phx for 4 years and back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes we have Rudy's, but they aren't nearly as accessible as they are in ATX. I went on a Wkd trip to Phx at the end of July and found out that there was a Rudy's in Chandler. My friend had never been there, so I convinced her to go there for breakfast. Unfortunately, she wasn't fond of the sauce, but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. Oh, that was delicious.
2031	I visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered 6 wings and fries and the small wings came in a cardboard box. The meal was overpriced for the quality. The restaurant is very small and there is not much room inside.
2032	We visited this restaurant last night and were seated on the lovely terrace. The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to chat and talk. The staff was very helpful and attentive. We had the Brussels sprout salad, which was one of the finest salads I've ever had. The steak was cooked perfectly and had a very nice taste. It was a really good meal and my husband and I shared everything and it was just enough for dessert.
2033	I understand Kafein is a bar in the evening, but it seems to me that it is a welcoming place for students to study during the day, so why play music that nobody can concentrate on?
2034	I've been here at least 4 times now and it's always very hot inside. Also, the service is very inconsistent. Sometimes our food arrives very fast, sometimes it arrives very slow. It's not necessarily a problem that it comes after our noodles, but it's strange that gyoza takes longer than my noodles. But everything is fresh, so it's fine.
2035	School uniforms, like special clothing, cannot save a man from cold or heat.
2036	The children lose their individuality and it's uncomfortable.
2037	Firefox respects W3C Internet standards better, while soft sucks by forcing us to use their own standards to maintain their monopoly.
2038	Before you install anything in your browser, a random toolbar appears in your browser.
2039	No, I don't think I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to the police a "snitch" or a rat, but if my wife wanted to murder someone, I would have no hesitation in using the 5th Amendment. Murder is a serious offense, but remember, when you say "I DO", you are basically inviting the person you are marrying into the family. So ask yourself, would you turn your family into the police? If so, join the police, otherwise, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy woman, though!)
2040	There's no debate if you're the one who actually read the book.
2041	Wow, Syona, I am very impressed with your views. Where did you get these unique data? I would like you to submit more points, like all of them, please. Please don't mind my words, but are all these special data correct? reply to me soon!
2042	I've got to say just one word: conspiracy, conspiracy, conspiracy.
2043	Why should India be leading the world? First kill all the politicians and India will develop tomorrow.
2044	India, where there's a whole class of people who are obedient and their wealth differs enormously, and their language is not understood by most people in the world and they don't want to.
2045	It's better to be without a father than to have a bad father.
2046	The Singapore Treaty was signed by Raffles, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong, with the commander on board the accompanying seven ships.
2047	Sir Raffles is the legitimate founder of Singapore because he used the Straits of Malacca as a trade route and he introduced free trade which brought many people into Singapore who traded with one another, increasing Singapore's economy.
2048	Raffles had been leading the expedition to find a new trading post, and Farquhar had only joined him, so that Singapore had been founded even if Farquhar had not come.
2049	Without Raffles' ambition and vision, Singapore would have been a sparsely inhabited island on the fringes of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
2050	Raffles was responsible for Singapore's economic boost He had made Singapore's economy stronger by using the Straits of Malacca as a trade route. He had also established free trade, which had brought many people into Singapore who had begun trading.
2051	God is abstract, he doesn't show himself very often. The idea of a god or gods is generally hard to think about.
2052	In fact, creationism is an argument that has existed ever since the beginning of human history, and I think you're referring to a period of recent Christianity, so the Bible account has existed for a much longer time than your comment.
2053	It doesn't make your argument stronger just because you think your opponent is being tricked in one way or another.
2054	IE is a snitches, stole the tabbed browsing idea from all the other browsers, and you can't get extensions for it.
2055	I'm fond of those cute little pop-up windows, but you don't get them in Firefox.
2056	Yes, of course, the respect for nature, sporting comradery, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation, to name but a few. Now, drop it and give me twenty for your insubordination!
2057	After the arrival of the British, Farquhar had been responsible for the establishment of the new settlement and, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen, had been responsible for its operation.
2058	William Farquhar had been dismissed from his post by Raffles because he had become too close to the people. But he must have known them well in order to solve the problems that they had.
2059	Raffles neglected Singapore when he conquered other "more useful" countries for about four years, leaving the work for Farquhar to do. In fact, the countries he had run had all turned out badly, proving that he had been a bad developer of the country.
2060	William Farquhar helped more Singaporeans than Raffles, and Farquhar was more of an innovator than Raffles.
2061	Pro-life means that more crack addicts and poor children are born.
2062	I'm not saying I'm a pro-life person, but I want to know someone else's answer. I honestly don't know if a 14-year-old girl is raped, and then gets pregnant, and because she's 14 and she'll die if she gets pregnant, what's the pro-life decision? Is it pro-life to abort?
2063	Is it any worse if my opponent is actually brainwashed and indoctrinated from birth?
2064	Why not both? Why couldn't God have created a way that evolution could have happened? Who says that he did that himself? Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution?
2065	Pornography's entertainment, is it wrong and evil to use swear words in songs because some people don't like it? Of course not.
2066	My parents, because of the way they're trying to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy, they're spending all their money and time on other people than themselves.
2067	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and use their talents and abilities for humanity's good. But we don't live in a perfect world, and we won't ever. I believe that everyone has a talent that can be used for the good of society. If everyone were to make an effort to improve society, our lives would be much easier.
2068	I'm talking about the common good because you can mobilize forces as a group, like the person who says that if he doesn't vote, he doesn't make a difference, and when you take into account the total number of people who voted, you see that the population or percentage is larger than the ones who voted. So if you want to be good and win, you need more than yourself to get together with people who have the same views.
2069	I think the uniforms are a good idea, because they make students more likely to attend school, and students don't have to spend a lot of time on selecting and buying clothes for school, especially girls, and that makes it possible for them to spend more time studying.
2070	I think they're good, all the girls out there don't tease one another about fashion, and they also make all the students feel equal, which increases their attention to studying since they don't have to think about whether they wear the most expensive clothes in school or whether they look the best and so on.
2071	Fathers can sometimes be unforgiving, but they're the ones who teach us how to be better parents. Fathers are supposed to be the ones who inspire us to rise above them.
2072	This is a bunch of ludicrous arguments, and they're not factual, and your team looks like a bunch of fools.
2073	Profits HA, wanna make money, wanna live longer without water, have fun with it
2074	TV is better than books because the educational programs are much more convenient and easier to understand, and it's also easier for people who can't see or hear. Books are also more likely to be out of date with the latest information on a certain subject, while TV information is much more precise and useful.
2075	Television uses electricity, and books like Harry Potter are made from trees, so they do more harm to the environment.
2076	In addition to the sale of water bottles, the plastics used in them and the advertising on the bottles and packaging are also important business. Moreover, compostable water bottles are also coming into the market, which could replace plastics in the future.
2077	The global bottled water industry grew by over 13% in 2002, and the US alone paid $7.7 billion for bottled water in 2002.
2078	We know that freshness and consistency are inextricably linked with our quality control standards. We have a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system that involves carefully controlled and continuously monitored disinfection processes in sanitary design lines. We test our water at every stage of the bottling process and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. We screen our water every year for over 200 possible contaminants, which is far more than the state and federal regulations require.-nuff said http://delivery.polandspring.com/Delivery/home/help/OurWater.aspx
2079	It's not possible, let alone right, but everyone isn't religious or adheres to any religious guidance. Marriage is defined as a union between women and men, so the word "marriage" can be misused here. But civil unions, that's another matter.
2080	I'm voting "Wrong", because it's against human nature and, as other voters have pointed out, marriage is defined by religion. Religion is there to guide us as to what's good and bad, and it's life, and without it, we're lost.
2081	Is incestuous marriage right or wrong? Does incestuous marriage include incestuous heterosexual marriage? Which country legalized gay marriage, which has led to lower marriage rates?
2082	I respect other views, but it's not natural and it's against my moral law.
2083	I'm a Christian, and the Bible says explicitly that homosexuality is wrong. I'm called pathetic, weak, or whatever you want to call me, but I'm sure that the Bible is the absolute truth, the whole truth, and the absolute truth.
2084	India's a good place to live, its culture differs but it's still one.
2085	I'm just aware that I'm an Indian, and I don't want to humiliate my country, and the person who thinks that all problems can be solved by discussion is mistaken, because he also knows what their country is like.
2086	India and China have the potential to lead the world, but so too, America continues to outsource good manufacturing jobs to these countries, which will boost India's and China's economy!
2087	Atheism's a great guy, he's making my logic work, and he's not scared of anything.
2088	It's foolish and stupid to think there's a gods, and any other argument is completely invalid.
2089	Yes, parents should use spanking as a means of disciplining their children, but it should be the last option.
2090	Yes, because sometimes it's not working out, so you have to give them a little spanking just to teach them what's wrong. Don't always spank them for no reason, that's wrong.
2091	I've been spanked once in a while, but I'm sure I've learned something. Don't spank your kids, though, with whatever you find, you don't wanna kill them!
2092	'Cause it doesn't always work, some children need it, 'cause sitting them in punishment is a risk that they'll do it again.
2093	Definitely Christianity, and I'm fortunate enough to attend a Christian school where I can learn more about our wonderful God :)
2094	I've found more peace in my faith, and I'll continue to pray to the Lord until I die.
2095	No, 'cause they're not really understanding what they're doing, 'cause they're barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.
2096	No, because spanking can affect the relationship between the child and his parents, and children may learn from their parents' behavior when they act violently. There are better ways of dealing with problems, such as using other techniques.
2097	The child is young and doesn't know what's wrong and what's good.
2098	I'm not sure anybody would like to have their parents spanking them, so it shouldn't be an option.
2099	Physical abuse of children causes them to fear their parents and may cause them to stop.
2100	Even though people do mistakes, murder is always committed with the best intentions.
2101	If a woman is raped and left with a fetus, she should be charged with murder. If someone murders a pregnant woman, they're going to be charged with murdering the woman and the fetus.
2102	You're mixing things up, which is creating a paradox in your argument. The debate is not about whether murder is morally acceptable, but rather about the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can base one's right to terminate a pregnancy. In addition, you might want to refresh your etymology and to vary your sources rather than simply describing definitions that suit your point of view.
2103	No, there are many people at my school who are overweight, and two weeks of PE haven't made a single difference.
2104	It's a lifestyle choice, but it's the choice of the person and the love interest. Love is all that some people have, and you can't give it away immediately because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. You can't let them be happy or just ignore them. You don't choose to be gay, either. Who would choose to live like this? They're constantly harassed and unable to be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please respect them. They've made a mistake. God created them that way.
2105	The "who cares" button was the back button of your browser. It's always a mystery to me that people spend time writing comments that say they don't care and everyone else should stop talking about it.
2106	I'd like to begin by saying that I don't think marriage is a necessity, and it doesn't need to exist, but that's another issue entirely. To me, the idea of marrying a man is completely irrelevant, and I think that animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony, which would certainly be a fun ceremony, much more fun than any wedding I've ever attended.
2107	In my opinion, if you improve yourself in the long run, you can improve the world.
2108	If I say that advencing the common good is better than a personal pursuit, I'm lying to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but there are too many bad things happening, and what you do doesn't really make a difference. A personal pursuit is more beneficial to you than advancing the common good in a world where you don't see much good.
2109	It seems to me that a personal pursuit is more important, because you cannot help others if you can't help yourself. If you want to make money for the needy or for the common good, it starts with you and your desire to make it.
2110	We should keep our jobs at home, pay decent wages for workers that keep up with the cost of living, which would not be nearly as much as it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along, and we should not try to be peacemakers in the world, money managers, both providing and then forgiving debt to "loan" more, and realize that all over the world have the same abilities and resources as we did, and they just need to choose to use the resources they have and develop a work ethic and employ them.
2111	The Americans have been shooting at him all along and will force the tribunal to impose the death penalty. But you must also know that Saddam is feared and respected by many in Iraq and the outcome of the recent bombings is directly related to Saddam's case.
2112	Yes, freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted so much that it is no longer free speech. But it is also important to ensure that people have the right to freedom of expression and that they are accountable.
2113	If you're fired, you must pay back all wages and other compensation (vacation pay, etc.) immediately. As a manager, you're responsible for the people you manage and the money. Your boss must prove that you stole the money, but perhaps you can get your job back by talking to the State or Federal Labor Department. You can sue for wretched employment if your boss can't prove that you stole the money.
2114	It is not the fact that it is bad or good, it is the way it is used, implemented and used. In India reservation is used to please some people and get quick votes.
2115	You can't get rid of him, and you can't complain about him.
2116	I'd call the cops and see what they find out, since the girl didn't do anything illegal, but the threat is real.
2117	You can't sue your employer for a condition that you might have been at risk of developing because of your health, eating habits, or simply laziness. The removal of the pituitary gland is not going to cause diabetes, but you probably had it before they performed the operation to remove it.
2118	I've missed the last change for a couple of months, so I'm aware of how unpopular it is.
2119	I'm not sure what you mean by "good unethical arguments" and I don't think Hitler thought the same thing. It's just a matter of ammunition and you won't find it here. And there's nothing ethical about blowing up Japan. Truman was convinced that they were targets of the military, when they were mainly women and children. There wasn't any military target in sight.
2120	I'm sorry, but I don't think there's any law that protects whites. I don't think there's any law that protects whites.
2121	You have to pay for haircuts, lawyers' services, tax services, and doctor's visits, because the school is a business, and you pay money to cover the costs of providing the service, because you are the one who benefits from it.
2122	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can speak whatever you like, provided it doesn't harm anyone else.
2123	You know, he's driving too fast for you? Get him to speed up, if he's speeding or driving carelessly, he can get a ticket. There's no law that the managers have to keep pizzas away from you just so you can deliver them. In fact, it's against the whole concept of customer service. The faster you get them, the better.
2124	It is absolutely ridiculous that some Muslims abuse generosity and hospitality so badly.
2125	First of all, incest isn't always "child abuse." Sex between closely related adults is probably happening in the USA. This isn't true. In fact, the highest rates of incest in the USA are found in Hispanics. In addition, incest is a serious problem in Central and South America.
2126	This guy is and was a pedophile and preyed upon little children, so don't get confused.
2127	No, I haven't, but it seems to me that she could benefit from some kind of help, or some kind of legal aid, or from some kind of social security.
2128	It's a very dangerous step to a total government nanny state. Of course, you're better off wearing a seatbelt, not smoking, exercising five times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors.
2129	YES! What's the point of punishing the dumb and letting the wives beat the booze heads free? Throw the potheads in jail? What kind of logic is that?
2130	I'm not sure this fits in with your emphasis, but I think it's important to remember that women were not included in the definition of human rights in the past..
2131	I think we already exist in exactly that misogynistic world you describe. Women are paid 75 for every dollar a man is paid for the same work. Women are 70% of the world's 1.3 billion people who love poverty. Women are 23% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults. Women are working 23% of the world's working hours and producing half the world's food, yet only 10% of the world's income and less than 1% of its wealth. How can anyone not be a feminist?
2132	If you're caught, the theater boss can remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back. It's dishonest and it's stealing.
2133	The point is not that they can kill people, but why? The execution of a known felon who has murdered countless lives forfeits his right to live in the eyes of the community. If he were released and thus caused more deaths in the population, it would be justified to kill him for the general good. The killing of a man who committed crimes that were not justified or deemed unjustified is not a crime, but a necessary and legitimate act.
2134	He's responsible for legal responsibility, but he might not have access to your medical records. In any case, you have access to your medical records under federal law, and the facility in question is responsible for keeping them.
2135	I believe that the mother should have the right to "no contact" but that an intermediary should be available in case of emergency. This is necessary so that women will not be pressured by the judgmental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It is very unfortunate that abortion is often chosen for this reason.
2136	I disagree, because I've been living on nothing, growing up in projects, and now I've built a little fortune. I don't owe anybody, and I'm going to walk away from anybody who tries to take what I worked for. My brother and I were the only whites on projects, and that's not right.
2137	If you commit a crime, you will have to repay society in some way or another.
2138	Many would like it to be, but the reality is, if it is, America's public would suffer, especially the working class and the lower income earners. The economic damage would be unbearable.
2139	Everybody should be treated equally, regardless of their race, ethnic background, or whatever else they have been born into.
2140	It sounds like we're becoming a communism, trying to pass a law like that. Who knows this country thinks that saying what a person can or cannot spend on food is helping our economy? There's more to obesity than buying too much food. Some people who are obese don't eat much, but they're eating junk and empty calories. Some buy healthy stuff and get things like Slim Fast full of preservatives and poison. Some don't exercise. Maybe we should pass a law on compulsory exercise or health and nutrition classes. Maybe we should stop selling junk food and make more affordable organic and natural foods.
2141	You've had a child with him, and unless you've been able to prove that he's a bad parent or committed a crime, you'll have to share parenting time with him.
2142	Well, if you don't have that kind of cash, you might not have a choice. But public defenders are generally good lawyers, and their main problem is that they're busy enough to do nothing but take care of the most important cases.
2143	You are correct in asking this question, unless you have been served with court documents, you are probably still married. There is a slight chance that your husband found an attorney who circumvented the service of process laws, and he could still be granted a divorce anywhere without your knowledge. There is no easy way of knowing, but a good divorce attorney or PI might be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you wish to be divorced, the best bet is to initiate the divorce proceedings yourself, and your attorney can serve your husband with a notice of execution if he cannot be found.
2144	First of all, if you want to stop your stepson from doing something libelous, you should contact the cops. The laws vary from one state to another, and you can find out what they are. If it's a civil matter, talk to a lawyer about bringing a case against your stepson and what the reasonable expectations might be.
2145	If life were fair, innocent people wouldn't be in prison, hard working people would make it.
2146	I've lost hope of a progressive movement in this country. I've been defending it to all my conservative friends in a *very* red State for 6 years. He's kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the GOP alternative to single payer, kept wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood by the NSA, etc., etc. Hillary Clinton is probably going to be the next president, and she's probably going to be even less progressive than the disappointment that is Obama. Please, change my mind before I become a 25 year old husk.
2147	I'm going to start by saying I love bulldogs, pugs and dogs in general, but these dogs with short noses have terrible breathing problems and a lot of other health problems. Every bubble of air is fighting, which is probably a factor in their sleeping and probably a cause of several of these health problems. I'm sorry to see these amazing dogs gasping for air, I can imagine all the health problems I would have had if I had to struggle with every breath. If I were misinformed, please help me, I would love to own a beautiful bulldog but I would feel terrible for all these reasons.
2148	_ In my last year of university, I found that the university environment was not inspiring. Three years later, I realized that everyone here is just passing by, trained to become another employment statistic in the department we are in, and worst of all, it felt like nobody was paying attention. For example, I had a project I had made myself, which I really enjoyed and did not want to finish, but it seemed that everyone else was just doing it without any passion for what they had made. _
2149	I've been watching a CNN special on genocides since the Second World War, and I think the US should not have intervened. I don't think we should have intervened if we hadn't done something. I think we should have done nothing.
2150	It may be different from one country to another, but in my country (UK), I've seen people complaining that healthy food is too expensive, then walking into a £1/1 kg bag of carrots that will last for several meals as a side, 80p bag of celery, a £1/1 kg bag of oats, a 75p/kg bag of bananas, several kilos of food here for under four pounds. If you have a big enough freezer, you can buy chicken breast in bulk that will last for months here, and then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat, but I've seen people do this several times a week, the same people who complain about the price of healthy food)
2151	I'm thinking that sports are a huge waste of time, energy and money, and that they divert our attention from the things in our society that really need our attention. I believe that far too much effort, human resources and physical resources are being diverted into useless feats of strength, which could have been used for the betterment of mankind.
2152	Most people, when they discuss politics, are most likely to form their opinion based on emotional reasons, rather than rational reasons. This is particularly apparent when, for example, two people with divergent views are discussing politics, and each of them will defend their opinion on ostentatiously rational grounds. However, most political discussions end with both parties saying, "Your argument is less persuasive than mine." There is a "meta" reason that leads a person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason, which is the actual reason for their opinion, is not rational.
2153	I've been talking to my parents, who are both very religious, and I've come to realize that while religion contributes to war, the biggest problem with religion is that it prevents the spread of progress in science, particularly in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (which deals with the question of climate change and evolution), and society, in particular in the fields of same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, etc.
2154	I think that socialism is better than capitalism because the hard working have a comfortable life and the non hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard just to survive. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I don't mean communism where there is no currency or ownership, but a market where everyone is free to spend but the poor are lifted up and the rich are taxed. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism?
2155	I went fishing last weekend with a friend and caught ten to fifteen fish. We caught them live, then we threw a hook through their faces and then they died. I don't understand why people do that.
2156	I think the Tories are all selfish money hoarders who don't care about anyone but themselves. Gove was a total disaster for education and now we have a woman who was previously Minister for Women and Equality but has also voted against gay marriage. She supports a lot of things that will only benefit the wealthy and powerful in this country (such as colleges and higher education) and I don't think anything will change under Gove's reign of terror.
2157	I don't think there's a natural right, i.e. *"...those not dependent on the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable."* I think all rights granted to humans are social constructs arising from moral structures determined by a myriad of factors. But, all of these rights can be taken away from them in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically granted to humans at birth.
2158	I've always thought of someone recording a video while holding the device vertically as a mouthbreather, but it just annoys me that they don't take into account how the video will look later when it's watched later on YouTube, Facebook, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.
2159	I have personally learned about the importance of vaccination and the issue of antivaccination from my research and conversations with friends and family. I believe that parents should decide whether children should be vaccinated or not. Some people do not get vaccinated and live long healthy lives, others do not. And that is the result of our biology.
2160	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively, and have not found anything that is a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which is responsible for our consciousness. This is the same as the fact that if you broke your speakers, you cannot hear the livestream you are watching.
2161	I am reminded of the snub of the Croatian team in the first round of the World Cup, which I think is a symptom of America's attempt to promote the idea that American team sports are superior, because at its core I believe that soccer is one of the most beautiful dramatic sports.
2162	If he had not been so cruel to the Jews, he would have been much more proud of his history, if he had not been so cruel to them.
2163	You see the videos of people who are surprised by a military member at their graduation or at school, and you think, "Wow, that's nice how happy they are." But think about it. Especially at graduation, the child has to wait days or weeks* for the disappointment of not being there. That's terrible. If it were me, I'd rather have been saved from the pain of being surprised. I want to know immediately that my mother, father or son is coming home early, and I would feel sad for longer than necessary, and lying is a bad move.
2164	I often read people talking about the idea of universal and inalienable rights, but I think that these rights are just constructs, and they don't have any basis beyond any other human constructs that have been created.
2165	I'm aware that this has already been asked before, but I'd like to get some fresh thoughts. The US is the world's biggest economy, more than double China's second place. The US is the world's entertainment capital, I realize Bollywood makes more movies, but I'm saying all quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games, etc.). The US is the world's biggest university, so it must be declared the best country.
2166	Neither of them were really gifted singers, IMO. Dino had a better voice, more range and better tambre, Francis was a better phrasing and timing, Frank had better material, especially in the mid-1950s when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs, and jazz musicians and fans liked Sinatra much more than Martin, even though neither of them were jazz singers.
2167	First of all, I am amazed that the gov didn't put duct tape over Biden's mouth. Second, the gov didn't even read the bill, and the bill has so much pork in it, it could be Porky the Pig reincarnated as a law.
2168	We didn't impeach GW, so why did we impeach Clinton? He just got his knob cleaned, GW sank trillions of dollars into debt, started wars costing thousands of lives, and trashed our name all over the world.
2169	We're just people, and if anyone likes the same sex relationship, that's their problem.
2170	Macs are cheaper, and they use generic hardware, not Apple's specific hardware, which is often believed to be faulty or broken less frequently than PCs. If you ever work in a place like I do, where Macs are networked together and used as the main computer, you'll see that Macs are just as vulnerable to problems as PCs.
2171	The Lion King has a much more serious and dramatic undertone than Aladdin, which is why I like it more than the other one.
2172	Yes, it's a fact that a debate on religion accomplishes nothing, but rather insults and a serious attack on one side or another is directed at them. No one will change their beliefs because someone quotes scientific or Biblical evidence that might or might not exist or be the same as it appears. Moreover, speaking for both parties, they both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so they'll just pick each other apart as they can.
2173	California is the best! - A place where you can make a difference. - A place where you can find the kind of hate and racism that you're used to seeing in other states. - A place where you can find the most beautiful landscapes and tourist destinations on earth. - A place where technology is born and where the future is headed.
2174	It's ZED people! When you talk on the telephone and you have to spell something that has the letter ZED, it's clear that you say ZED. And when you talk to a Yankee and you have to spell ZEE, you get so much "did you say V or D?" And so we can all get along.
2175	It is, of course, and I would compare this situation to the Iraq War. The Israeli government and the U.S. are in a very bad and dysfunctional relationship. We have helped Israel to become a nation that relies on terror and violence against the opposition rather than balancing power with diplomacy. If Israel decides to attack Iran without justification, you can bet that the U.S. government will back off.
2176	It's basically the trendy stuff that most young people listen to, MTV or Z100.
2177	No, suicide is not only a drain on the country's resources, education and so on, but also means the loss of potential contributions that a person might make to society.
2178	We've all seen different colors, and most of them are shades of other colors.
2179	(1) Market prices around the world continued to fall, with the US, Europe and Japan's markets reaching record lows this week. (2) A torrent of bad news came out of the world's corporations this week, with many reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s, and companies started a round of massive job cuts, which will slowly destroy consumer confidence and ultimately lead to a recession.
2180	I don't understand why the US government doesn't accept the supreme being, even though it seems to accept it.
2181	Agents, this is a call center, and it should have been a cliché. Even though the management is creating the "strategy", if it is not in the best interest of the Agents, they need to come up with another plan, otherwise the Agents will be unable to do anything but follow.
2182	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truths, you need proof to support your claim. If you refuse to provide this proof, you're preventing him or her from knowing the truth, and quite frankly, if he or she died and was condemned to eternal damnation, isn't your blood on their hands? You had the means to save him, but you didn't.
2183	It is not the usual use of the term, that most people talk about things that have not yet been proven, and that there is much doubt. This is not the case. Gravity is just a scientific theory, and relativity is another. It is ridiculous to say that evolution needs proof, because gravity is believed to be a fact.
2184	I had a great experience here. My date had a prime rib and I had a burger with 3 different types of meat. My date loved it and her mashed potatoes were cooked perfectly. The only negative thing I can say is that the mac and cheese. I did speak with the manager and they are working on it. We will definitely come back!
2185	The place is very comfortable, almost like a wooden cabin. The food is good, lobster rolls, PEI mussels and boneless back rib burgers, all of which I would recommend. But the noodles are not very good, I missed them all three times I was there.
2186	I went in on Monday night and there were a few servers there, but none of them took our order for 15 minutes and we left. The manager came over and asked how we were doing and he asked and went on. Why ask me how I'm doing when you clearly don't care or want to know why, as evidenced by the pace of your entrance into the restaurant, mind-boggling!
2187	The food was really good, our server Samantha was very good, but when she came to our table she ran after her and we were forced to chase her down. She may have given her an extra $3 tip on the card bill, which was $47, and when I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have asked for a refund, but we did not keep a receipt, so there was no way of knowing what had happened.
2188	I've tried two curries and pad Thai, but I'm not sure this place is the best or the most authentic Thai food I've ever eaten in Arizona.
2189	I had a group of 12 people and it wasn't really fun.
2190	I was very disappointed with the food portions at the price point, or maybe I was just angry that this place took over Messinis. I gave 1 star because I had high expectations and failed, it had big shoes to fill, Messinis failed, food portions at the price point, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good, but it was better if it cost $7. I will always try a new place, but I won't recommend it or go back.
