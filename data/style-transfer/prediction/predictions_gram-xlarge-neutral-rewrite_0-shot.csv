0	students are encouraged to wear what they like and feel free about their clothes
1	people cant be forced to wear school uniforms, i mean each person has theri own wish whether they want to or dont want to wear school uniforms. i think each principal should think once again regarding the uniforms
2	That form of argument degrades this forum, and will cause the arguments to fall to the lowest common denominator. That claim, "indisputable", I do not think it means what you think it does. I dispute your claim from personal experience, if nothing else. That makes it disputable. I think Yahoo! has chat rooms more attuned to your style of debate. Check them out.
3	I wouldnt turn her in becuase she is my wife. She made a mistake that we can get over. If she trusted me by telling me what she did then I couldn't do that to her.
4	No I wouldn't turn in my spouse. Just because the girl that i married killed someone doesn't make them a bad person. People make mistakes.
5	TV is terrible. Except for Spongebob, maybe. That's an alright show. Still, the majority of television is terrible. So I'd have to say books based on that.
6	I love books, I love getting lost in them. They also improve your literature (so my English teacher said).
7	When you read a book you save money. I would like to point out that when you read a book, you do not need to buy any devices for reading and it is not necessary to use electricity.
8	I think that books are better than TV is because it is better i can put you in a whole northern world and it is educational
9	Books enlighten the soul. Books don't destroy the morals of children. Books throw the mind into a series of questions, they take the readers to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. They change your perspective on life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine.
10	India has Strong Military Neighbors (China & Pakistan)...India has bad relation with Pakistan as they have territorial disputes and also fought 4 wars for this... and as far as china, Indian relation also become tense with china...due rise of territorial disputes and Indian interference in Pakistan....as Pakistan China has long term plans....for example Pak China Economic Corridor and Gawadar Mega Oil City....
11	india they actually really suck. so, BOO INDIA BOO!
12	india is is good adopter but a bad developer and leader should be a great developer
13	Russell Peters is very good at making fun of these people.
14	according to a recent report 50% scientists in NASA are indian IITians, just imagine that if those scientists will join ISRO then our status,value and astronomical knowledge of india will definetly increase. Now,think abt. IITians,students who are qualifying iit, they are known to be superbrain.If India is capable of opening hitech institutions,then why we are unable provide them a perfect job of their level.we are giving international status of education.then why unable to take best advantages from them.this is due to brain drain,lack of industrial development,suitable working environment as well as proper salary.so its the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
15	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a bad one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great. So yes, as opposed to having a bad father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather be fatherless.
16	Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all, I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a bad father would be with you in your thoughts forever.
17	Raffles was followed by Farquhar during his visit to Singapore. This shows that Raffles saw Singapore before Farquhar making him the founder
18	Raffles had written his discovery wrongly as 29 February 1819.It was later corrected. He thought he had discovered Singapore on his first journey
19	It was Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without him, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
20	Raffles established local magistrate in Singapore.This magistrate led to activities such as public gambling and slavery to be controlled. Farquar protected Singapore from the Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
21	That's interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years.... Another question- With this whole "big bang" theory. It seems like everything should have blown apart in a big bang and not come together.
22	I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Every tiny cell has it's own design that is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances?
23	although i voted for evolution... creation is easier to accept due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.
24	Believing "Evolution" as in Darwinism and the like, is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring the pieces out because two pieces kind of fit together.
25	Firefox (and the extensions) leaks memory. An opened session of Firefox 2.0.0.1, three tabs, one week, uses 250 Meg of memory under Task Manager on Windows.
26	PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. But when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy and lie on the couch all day then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Besides, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.
27	To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times he left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more competent leader.
28	The only other choices are, adoption or keep it. And I know many children get adopted but many don't and it might be better off to just have an abortion. That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to decide one woman's pregnancy.
29	Who are we to say what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
30	Actually, we are evolving. Look this one up; every generation our small toe is becoming increasingly smaller. Eventually, we'll end up losing it. I know it's a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage and who really cares about it, but it is evolution at work.
31	Why is this up for debate? I understand that people have religious beliefs and stuff, and thats fine by me people should be able to do what they without being judged on every move they make, but it's scientifically proven that the evolution is correct. What's your point?
32	So why don't we have talking monkeys? That's a red herring. Monkeys haven't evolved to talk (by talk im guessing you mean speech) because they are incapable of speech. We on the other hand have evolved to talk. Yes if we are descended from monkeys that doesn't stop monkeys from existing. We are a BRANCH on the tree of life. Not a dead end.
33	Porn is not wrong. If it is really wrong, then it should be "Illegal". Porn supplies the "Erotic" needs of people who doesn't have a partner. :)
34	Porn isn't inherently wrong because It can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice. It really is just as simple as that.
35	hmm, yess they are either all virgins or still live at home with there mothers and cant have porn
36	it is not wrong, and if your talking about the actors doing the scene its their choice..they like doing it and its not degrading to women they wanna do it. we have freedom of expression you know. and it also helps some of us to be open about sex
37	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A jerk. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
38	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt mean i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.
39	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.
40	It is a good thing because this shows that the school and everyone else accepts each other no matter where they come from, who they are or what religion they are.
41	Wearing school uniforms U can be sure that you go to school to study, not showing how fashionable you are
42	Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.
43	THE SCHOOL UNIFORM IS A VERY GOOD IDEA, WHY?? becouse the school uniform makes pupils concentrated on their education than on their clothes and I believe that school uniform instills discipline among pupils it makes pupils with diferent material statuses more equal :)
44	To have a father is better than to not have one at all. I know that a bad father is very bad to have and he probaly wont do all the things that a good father would do, but at least you have that assurance that you have someone that is a father in your life. I believe that people can change. You can never feel the same way about somebody for your whole life. There will come a time in his life that he will realize that he needs to be there for you. If you have no father, then you have no chance of that at all.
45	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. So a lousy father is better than none.(that is of course assuming that he is not abusive in any way) Also, people change. Who says that he will be lousy forever? There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.
46	To my knowledge people are able to change and make themselves better people. I would much rather have the hope that my father could be a good father than know that I will never meet him. I would be too curious as to what kind of father he could of been.
47	The next level thinks he is the next level, and Atlas would drop the world for a chance to shake his hand.
48	The growth in bottled water production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. Additionally, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.
49	Water bottles can easily be made into long term fiber materials, like clothing or carpet. Additionally, it is easy to just fill cup with water and re use it.
50	TV is WAY better than reading books from the OLDEN DAYS!!!
51	tv is more entertaining than book dathu ihfej tijkjdrk xtklp09 guil09 sfjiiytg dh,lut457 p[];o;l
52	I love TV so much I can watch what ever i want and it is just the best. with TV you can watch DVDs and play on playstations.
53	Most Americans on average recycle 86-88% of there bottle waters. That is more than half! So stop complaining that we dont recycle because we do! http://www.treehugger.com/culture/23-percent-of-americans-donatmt-recycle.html
54	there aint no sunshine without plastic water bottles. only darkness every day.
55	We will be able to ban water bottles once we get out of this recession!
56	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called "civil unions." "Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal..." This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact? "...why challenge any assumption?" I'm not arguing that law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my rebuttal to res0ndf7 for more on this line.
57	there is no such thing as "gay marriage". marriage can only be between a man and a woman.
58	I am an American, and I am ashamed to admit "Merica is rich due to slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich until the British came and took everything away. We were left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America and soon when everyone has education (which will happen in our lifetime) India will excel. India has the potential.
59	India is a secular state.people of all communities reside here so india has the knowledge of almost all countries and the way they live. so it can easily lead all the people of the world without creating any nuissance among anyone.
60	how can Indians say that india don not have the potential to lead the world?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
61	I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again. So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.
62	It all depends on the severity of the kill. For instance, I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him free, but if I knew it was a malicious deed instead of self defense, or to defend his family or belongings I would probably leave and want nothing to do with it.
63	I would say that i would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer in my bed.
64	I would definately turned them in even if it hurst me. Any person that commits a murder should not get away with it because if they did it once they can do it again so it dangerous to have them out in the enviroment. Also, if i dont turn her in how do i know that later on in life i might be a victim.
65	The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever. The government DOES have that right. 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public there are many others. Men can also not do these things. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
66	I am Pro-Life, Here is a question for anyone who is pro-choice: Is the fetus in the mother's stomach living and if not how do you know?
67	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the fetus while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
68	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way you see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way...you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wanna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yes there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
69	There are tons of ways to not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's fault that she didn't do it. And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around.
70	If a women is raped is a good argument. However why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime. If the woman does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just dont understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.
71	Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Many who do not want it to be allowed just dont like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudiced. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??
72	The Bible is not the origin of marriage. Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded Christianity (and Judaism). The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage.
73	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."
74	If you do not like gay marriage and thing it is wrong then do not watch a gay couple kiss. Who are you to tell people that their views are incorrect and that they must change there feelings and that apparently they are wrong. Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.
75	I think that personal pursuit is more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. Therefore, not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.
76	Sallu, thanks for answering my question. Politics is very useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretically. Why don't terrorists blow up every city here? I mean are frisked everytime you leave your house? No. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don't have to always be right but take time to learn.
77	Perhaps me: 1. I hate bush. 2. I hate the christian ethos that he's trying to push on the country. 3. I'm a pagan, so not a christian, therefore i'm a threat. 4. I'm a bisexual, and have had sex with guys, therefore i'm a threat. 5. I don't aggree that what bush is doing is right for this country. and #6. I'm an individualist. I believe that the choices that we make in our lives are our own; rules, government, ect should be concerned with protecting our individual safety; not being concerned with controlling how we lead our lives, either on the spiritual or on the individual level. Because of this, i'm an anti-socialist :) Which makes me a direct threat to the government bush is trying to create. Therefore, i'm sure that my name is somewhere on his 'long' list of 'offenders'.
78	Its as old as known history. The earliest civilations practiced it back even in Mesopotamia (which is older than Egypt). It was not created by the "white devil" that you hear about today. I do wonder how many blacks in America would be willing to go back in time and stop the importation of their ancestors...Hmmm, Africa has aids, drought, pestilence, civil wars, ethnic genocide, and no economy. America sounds pretty good after all!
79	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to step up and fight for them. California is pretty fair when it comes to dads. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you unless you are found unfit for some reason. Do you have a court order? You need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction from the lastest court order. Good luck and you really need fight for this. Your kids need to have contact with their father, it may scar them for life you don't want them to think you abandoned them do you?
80	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably speak to one about this, but here's my two cents. The full legal text says, "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works." Determining what is "primarily intended" for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
81	No. That is the beauty of the USA, you have no health care. Why would it change if you had to go to jail while the rest of the public pays their hard earned money into taxes. Your brother is in jail for a reason, maybe if he had contributed to society instead of commiting crimes he would not be in this situation. Jail has no company benefits.
82	Yes. If you execute a murderer he will NEVER escape, he will NEVER hurt anyone else. And it helps the victim's family heal. The thought that a murderer is still alive grates on the minds and heartsof the families of the victims. There is something that is inherently just about executing a murderer, because the victim will NEVER have another birthday, will NEVER have another holiday with their families. Some crimes are so vile that the only punishment can be death.
83	Skating in general isn't illegal. It's just that skating in certain public places is illegal.
84	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thought? How long will it take for you to formulate an unpopular belief? Are you prepared to go to jail for your beliefs?
85	Usually, that isn't the question guys are asking... Oh, maybe you aren't the dad, but the mom. My bad. If you were the dad: You could always just give extra money that doesn't go throught the courthouse. Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed. Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't. Don't listen to the people who tell you that you should be able to support the child on your own. You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own. Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place. Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job. It goes by a percentage of his income.
86	I agree unless there is something in it for us it's a hard sell to convince the us to send troops to police the world, though I do applaud it when we do. the problem is we always get caught up in the quagmire of international politics and never fully commit to a mission, thus we fall short and it looks like a half hearted attempt with casulties that we have a hard time stomaching. Look up a group called Executive Outcomes to see how it's done right.
87	no, if your connected to city sewers you have to pay. check with your city councilman. they probably negotiated a billing delay when they were first installed. even if it was a city oversight. its a service you have to pay for. they charged me extra sewer when i filled my pool and thats 6000 gal worth, even though it didn't go down the drain. if they can charge you they will. especially if all your neighbors are connected, they don't give you a choice.
88	Contrary to what most people think, most states do not have laws addressing minimum ages to babysit or minimum ages that children can be left alone. Unless someone can cite a specific Illinois law, chances are the answers you get here are of little value. While 15 or 16 might sound like logical numbers, that doesn't mean the answers are correct on the law. I don't know Illinois law nor am I going to make up some number for you.
89	In a free society, there is no such thing as the "right" to not be subjected to offensive things. If you read the newspaper, browse the web, watch TV, etc. you will be offended in the West. You do have the right to protest (peacefully), picket, rally other people to do the same. If their "deen" (a Muslim word for faith) is strong, they shouldn't worry about what some non-Muslim has to say about their religion. Yes, I've seen the cartoons. They're a lot less offensive than what the OFFICIAL newspapers of some nations such as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, etc. say about Judaism
90	I feel that its totally against everything that is American. How about everyone straps a GPS system to their legs so the government knows where everyone is, oops that's right cell phones. Besides this the government is saying its all in public safety, but i dont kno how safe i feel if i know someone is listening to my phone calls. Give me a break. If I wanted to blow some shit up I wouldn't talk on the phone to make plans for it anyway.
91	I would say not all foreigners..er which country they are from.. Just as the entire world has favs and non favs.. I think the non favs for countries already know who they are and why...If a nation is violent and not good for the world and the government...lies and steals...and kills innocent humans...well then...it is not well liked..or the people either..because the government is suppose to represent the people..So...it is the government that causes it and their people that pay for it.
92	OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license. We need the law because a standard drivers license will make the country more secure against terrorists. Many of the 9-11 terrorists had drivers licenses they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you're putting in your bill. The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal skill with the English language, and proof of address. The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. The program will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, so it will not need tax revenues. It will actually remove a burden from the states.
93	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader? Well, let's quote him. He once wrote "you can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea". He was writing about how the idea of freedom from oppression is catching, and will spread regardless of attempts to stamp it out. There is still oppression in the world. There is still a thirst for freedom from it. So why not? The same basic conditions apply as when Che was alive.
94	In one sense you bring up an interesting point. Let me challenge you with a broader concept......do our Laws reflect our Morality....or does morality stem from the Laws we make each other abide by? In their written series of civilization, Will and Ariel Durant made the point in the first book, "Our Oriental Heritage", that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbor needed them. Think on that a bit as you ponder your own question. In my own personal opinion, I do believe that faith can and should inform public policy.
95	The appeal must be won. The court holds the conviction addullted, void, overturned as if it no longer exists. Expungement of the records is another matter and that requires more legal work. Even if that were to be granted, there is always a paper trail and just, for example, the fact that someone was arrested in the first place will always be part of that trail. It is practically impossible to get rid of all of the record, even with a court order.
96	If my neighbor smokes pot, it doesn't pick my pocket, it doesn't break my leg, it doesn't infringe on any of my rights. How then, is it any of my business? My neighbor's body belongs to my neighbor -- he has the right to take risks with that body. It isn't an appropriate function of government to make us "be good"; if it were, we'd soon have laws compelling us to exercise and eat our spinach.
97	no your not racist for wanting your family to have the same rights as the "others". in fact you should have more rights if you were born and bred in the country but unfortunatley here in britain that is not the case we actually have less rights whilst recieving less benefits if we become unemployed or sick as opposed to the imigrants (alot of which are illegal) who get much more of OUR money that we worked for which they take
98	your crime does not fit under discrimination, as you committed that crime. That was a choice, unlike race, gender, etc...I don't think that everyone will turn you down, I typically look at the crime when hiring, and believe me, there are a lot more people out there with records than you would guess. If someone was a thief, or violent, I will not hire them. Companies can refuse to hire for ANY reason. It may just be that here in Michigan the economy is so bad, and unemployment is so rampant, that their just aren't enough job openings. But, I would be honest about yourself, if they are asking.
99	This is an interesting question in light of the laws that punish some people more severely than others because of their opinion, even when committing exactly the same act. I am referring to "Hate Crime" laws that enhance a criminal offense because of the person's opinion/rationale for committing the crime. For example, if one person kills another person because he hates that person’s ethnicity or religious views then he will receive a harsher punishment than another guy who kills without hate, simply because he enjoys killing. The point is, you may be entitled to your own opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts and NOT just the act.
100	Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good. They are not permitted to give legal advice. That having been said, why don't you give us some more details about the judgement. What was it for? When was it perfected? Why do you say that it is expired. What state do you live in? In California, for instance, judgements expire after 10 years. If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever. The only way to actually get it off your credit report is to petition the court to have it expunged. Chances are real slim on that. Otherwise, you're probably just going to have to deal with it being there.
101	I think you have a case... did you happen to take pictures of all of these "repairs"? Sometimes just the threat of small-claims court will get them to write a cheque. You may have to pay a lawyer to write up the court documents, unless the clerk is willing to help you out. You did agree to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality. The fact that they tried to repair the stand, indicates they insured the UNIT part also. Good luck.
102	With the other issues of depending on the government aside, you need one to protect yourself. Regardless of whether the police are there to protect you, if you have a person break into your house in the middle of the night, you may not have time to call the police. Even if you do and they are only five minutes away, you can be killed a hundred times over in five minutes. You have a right and a duty to defend yourself and your family.
103	i think prostitution is overrated, if people wanna have sex and get paid, yes they are. a woman can have sex with many men and get nothing, but if the men throw her a few dollars, she is a prostitute, why? why give it up for free. my take is if a guy friend of mine want's to have sex with me and my light bill is due, and i don't have it, hey, why not, get the bill paid and feel good while doing it
104	Our borders should be closed, we are at war we can not afford to take care of these people, we are not even taking care of ours. No one has a reason to teach them English, they can learn to speak English before coming over here to take the test. If I go to a foreign country I don't expect them to take the time to teach me their language, not even realistic. They need to go work at bettering their country just like we are trying to do. How many of these "illegal immigrants" are fighting in our war?
105	There are many types of abuse mental, physical, neglect, Maybe she just doesn't want you around anymore. Perhaps it is payback for something you did, and she just can't get over what you did to her. This restraining order can be a piece of mind,"If he is not around me, he can't hurt me anymore." It may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier. "If I don't see him, then I don't have to be reminded of how he has lied, cheated, let me down, whatever the case is".
106	Firstly, Cops (nor anyone else) do not piss you off. You choose to be. If you choose not to be pissed off, then you won't be. It's called a Victim mentality. You own your emotions, no one else. Secondly, since I am a cop I can say this much... I remove skaters from areas that are posted with no skateboarding signs, where vandalism is a common occurrence or where there are trespass warnings (both the kind you see and the kind you never knew). I do not, nor do I know any other officers, that set out to "piss" people off. It is merely enforcing the laws that are applied upon them. You may not be a problem, but the two dozen other skateboarders before you might have been.
107	Yes to an extent, what is commonly refered to as racial profiling makes sense (when not abused). For example: A car load of black or hispanic kids are rolling around a lets say mostly white upscale neighborhood at 3 am,plates get run, and it's pretty obvious they don't live in the area and may be up to no good. I believe that is an acceptable type of profiling. I will say the same for a car load of suburban white boys driving around the hood,in high drug areas etc. That, contrary to popular belief, is also profiling. Crime needs to be controlled and I dont personally see it as a violation of ones right's to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicous. Of course people will call me racist etc, but to an open mind what I just stated makes sense and is fair.
108	You r wrong my dear they havent been shut down in India, the ban is only in Maharastra. The Gov had shut down because the gov had received many a compliants from the housewifes about their male familly members wasting money on ladies bars and not looking after the families. Also many criminal activities took place at this bars. U must be knowing the tarannum case, or telgi case where tarannum monthly income was arouned 1 lac and telgi would throw away nereby 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on shuch type of criminal activities the Gov of Maharastra had put a ban on these ladies bar
109	First off the ancient rite of war that every nation has lived by including the Lakota, which removed the Nation that was here before them, the victor of war gets the land. While there was some chicanery and our forefathers only really won a hand full of battle the Indian Wars were more a war of attrition and the Nations lost the land due to that fact. Yes, we have contributed to the land, there are more trees than were on the Continent at the time of Columbus's landing. We grow most of the food uses to survive.
110	Here's another thing to think about...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliation, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case seperately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! Scary stuff.
111	Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. For example, they often lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, and whether or not they will support the child financially. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father.
112	All my life I've grown up around religious people, always telling me abortion was wrong, murder, and immoral. But I slowly realized, it's not really a fully formed human, how could it be murder? This never made any sense, it's someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Don't shame them into having a baby based on religious views. Anyway, I'm rambling, but I'm interested to see other views on this, so go ahead and try to change my view. If it matters, I'm Christian, 16, and male.
113	I can't see how the adversarial judicial system helps to get at the truth. It seems more about how well an argument is presented than the facts of a case. The way that both sides draw conclusions, and attempt to manipulate the jury with emotional language into believing them seems deceptive. In addition the jury, who are basically untrained (in terms of weighing evidence) people decide which argument is better seems to be a poor method of getting at the truth. What are the arguments in favor of this system?
114	I hate to be a downer, guys, but I don't think humanity has another 100 years left (give or take a few years). I want to believe that things will be alright, but when you keep hearing worse and worse news about the environmental degradation of the planet (even if you are still somehow a climate-change denier, you have to admit the oceans are massively polluted and huge amounts of fish are dying, the air in some parts of the world like China is almost unbreathable and getting worse, etc.), it's hard to see humans coming out of this ok. I hate to say it, but I don't think we have another century left. Please tell me why I'm wrong.
115	*For the international CMVs the term greek refers to a social component of my university that throws open parties every weekend.* A lot of people may say that to a certain extent everything is alright in fun and humor, but I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned. By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a "joke" to those who attend in attire. Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific party themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.
116	Every time I hear the Wilhelm scream (and it has been used in over 200 films) I am completely removed from the scene and sometimes even laugh at what might be a serious scene. Often it is used so unsubtly that it just reflects lack of effort from the director and it seems as if they are just trying to fit the scream into the film somewhere with no regard to what effect this has on the film. I understand that it is an "in-joke" but I believe that it is too widely recognized to be used any more without the audience acknowledging it.
117	For instance, prostitution stings should be illegal. And drug deal stings. Anything that does not have a victim, and there is no physical harm/ bad intentions. If a police officer witnesses a drug deal, or a prostitution deal, that's one thing. But setting people up for these crimes, to me seems as if the police are "shopping" for criminals to take in. Baiting and reeling them in. Often times, these people may have gone about their days without committing a crime.
118	The title is self explanatory. Vladimir Putin is the head of a disappointed ex-empire, willing to gain its former glory. The Russian people is traditionally obedient one, willing to submit to an autocratic will, and ready to devote itself to general patriotic ideals (i.e. getting new territories). The guy seems very determined not to comply with the Western moral and politic values and seems defiant to the present unanimity of attitudes against his latest moves. It is already quite obvious that Russia's stances in international politics is not a democratically generated one, but exclusively owed to Putin's will. He likes war, confrontation and seems indifferent to the human costs of his actions. He is determined to make history by any means, just like the celebrity killers do their crimes to get unforgettable no matter how.
119	Forgive any rambling, Im going to ensure I hit the 500 word limit. With the exception of the moon where the dirt bike is amazing for rack up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave the down force keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailor made for those levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill. CMV!
120	First of all, very first of all, us people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min? I can see that many people in reddit disagree with this, however, and I want to know why, so I can form a balanced opinion. So CMV!
121	I am just under the impression that a man's first love is his strongest love and every following love is a bit weaker each time. Also each following love is trying to match the intensity of the first love, a bit like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time. I base much of my view on the belief that after separating from your first love the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever. By this I mean that you no longer believe in the "fairy tale" love stories and start to see just how hurtful love can be. Reddit change my view.
122	With all the hoopla over the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death (which I don't think was truly accidental but that's for another CMV), I'm reminded of how his death did something powerful. Dying more or less voided out most if not all of the bad he did in the public conscience. I know MJ isn't an isolated case and it seems to be the rule for people who die young from JFK to Tupac or from John Lennon to Andrew Brietbart. However, outside of the "never speak ill of the dead" adage I can't see any reason why humanity keeps deifying the prematurely dead. To see one's bad deeds scrubbed away on Earth with no one to speak of them again just feels wrong and downplays their earthly acts. I think speaking ill of the dead who did bad things should totally be acceptable and death should not be a cleanse to one's legacy. Am I alone here?
123	These days, we grant more rights to convict's than we ever have. While I appreciate people make mistakes, I believe some actions should have permanent consequences, and that we have morally compromised ourselves in making exceptions to this.
124	I'm not talking about my parents here. They are wonderful people. I meant grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (Not brothers / sisters either, only child) Most of my parents' argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for you. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
125	So, if you are on a beer run with friends and one of them forgets their I.D. but they are not purchasing, requiring them to show I.D. is both a useless and inconvenient policy. I can understand why they would have it, but even following basic rational thought it doesn't make sense. There's nothing stopping the person buying the products from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing or ultimately, preventing any real liability on the part of wal-mart. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place. CMV.
126	One of my favourite movies of all time! I believe John Hammond had a great vision, but was poorly advised by his HR department, thus severely underpaying his most vital employees. Other than that: - The Park would be a major boost to the economy of the Dominican Republic, as well as any other nation where it opens shop. - It would motivate kids across the globe to venture into science disciplines. - It would further our understanding of our planet. The possibilities are endless. As long as we *spare no expense* So, can you CMV?
127	Video games should be treated like a drug. Millions of lives are impacted because people are not MONITORED or don't use them in moderation. Especially children that are becoming consumed and obsessed, it takes over their lives and social skills. It's so sad. I feel so strongly about this because I went through the same thing as a kid and I wish more than anything to go back and change it. But also, I'm grateful because now I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone again. Let's start a petition, guys!
128	It is pointless. I see no positive thing about it. It is not the best way to communicate to people seeing as we have phones, email, instant messenger, video calls, and video chats. The apps have no meaning and are really not that fun. I also do not understand why anyone would wanna post about their feelings or what their doing and shout it out to everyone. I really do not care if billy bob is going shopping. It is also a place for online and maybe real life stalkers.
129	If Iraq has taught us anything at all, it is that brutal, repressive dictators have their place in the world. If this administration had any sense at all, they would have had a Delta squad hunkered down right under the gallows with a stepstool, ready to spirit Saddam away to his rightful place at the capital. It takes a mean bastard to run a 160,000 square-mile lunatic asylum.
130	As powerful as superman is- he does have a noted vulnerability to psionic powers, so professor X (or phoenix, or apocalypse) would be able to control/trap/destroy him. And Batman has no powers- just gadgets- Magneto could make short work of him. And the flash? So he runs. Wow. Oh yeah, professor X could take him down too. In fact- professor X could probably take them all out by himself without all the other god like marvel characters.
131	Yes, it WILL recover - PROVIDED the government stops its meddling and 'bailing out' measures. It's things exactly like this that turned the potentially temporary market drop into a huge and horrid 'Great Depression'. As part of the'measures' then instituted were some of the Union Laws which are STILL crippling our ability to be competitive.... I wish lawmakers HAD TO take at least SOME relevant history while in high school...
132	I hear all too often that science is 'playing God'. We as a species have superceeded the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments to the point that we are not aware of our declination. If god did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If god wishes us to stop, he is inhumane.
133	Unless every single gun that is issued legally is tested with ballistics before being issued so that any bullet fired from a licensed gun can be traced, if found intact, then guns pose a threat because there is no way for those bullets to be traced back to owners so they can account for the shots they fired. It's like giving someone a jaguar as long as they promise to never let it out of their site. It's ridiculous.
134	I don't know where you live, but here in SoCal we have pizza delivery services availabe until 3am, plus I'd rather go to Del Taco anytime over Taco Smell or Taco Hell aka Taco Bell. Back in the 60s before Taco Fell became part of another multi-national corporation they were good, in our high school days we go there to cure the munchies, tacos were 5 for a buck back then. JJ
135	I see that there's actually no arguments, so I'm just going to clarify a few things for the 'No' argument. Even though Principals do obtain the right to search (for drug tests, even making the student take off his/her socks if the dog sniffs something on that student), they only retain that right in the event of reported drugs or crime, or in the case that sniffer dogs checks are enacted and the dog smells something. There are restrictions - a principal can't just demand to search a student's possessions on whim - outlined in the Criminal Code. YCJA and Canadian Charter of Rights (as well as parallel US laws). Thus, the right keeps the entire student body safe and away from harmful substances.
136	First off, bribing a child would be defined as doing something like this (Now David, if you just put your shoes and coat on mommy will buy you a toy after we are done at the doctor's office) or (Karen, if you take the garbage out I'll buy that blouse you wanted) or (It's time to get off the swing, we have to leave...come on honey, if you get off we'll stop at the store and buy the video you wanted) or (just eat your vegetable and I'll give you extra icecream) this type of thing being said after pleeding with your child to do what you want.
137	I've had this discussion with my brother various times. I think that the name 'Sublime' does not accurately describe the band to which it refers. First, there are multiple definitions for the word. "elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc." certainly does not describe the band, nor does "impressing the mind with a sense of grandeur or power; inspiring awe, veneration, etc." But what about "supreme or outstanding"? Of course, there is a certain amount of opinion involved in this. But the general consensus, I think, would be that the name does not describe the band. I don't have anything against the band, or their choice of name. In fact, I like a few of their songs. But it is certainly ironic that'sublime is not sublime'.
138	sure why not, if that interests the young individual... its an art and takes time to perfect no different than cooking, so starting early would mean perfecting it sooner. it doesnt necessarily mean that they're gonna be drunks later on in life, its still up to the person's discipline. there a lot of young people who were never bartenders, i think what they should include in bartending courses is a better understanding of alchoholic beverages and its effects.
139	So you dispute the Pontias Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene. And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption. The whole controversey is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead.
140	The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity. For example, if a dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through the use of paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning. Perhaps in the example above, we are dealing with conditioning, not memory.
141	I have a strong opinion that before having children, the prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and IQ tests. Kids being brought into this world need a good foundation to start a successful life with. You may have that limited case where the parents are not very intelligent and the kids strive to be different then their failure parents, but in most cases it is an endless line of parasites on our world. We need more smart people.
142	the reason mariage should be kept sacred is for what the man and woman will produce, a child its the best and most natural arangment to raise a happy and healthy child and the continuation of the family unit a man and a man or woman and a woman, not going to grow more branches of the tree, so shouldnt be called mariage, call it something else
143	Our monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely, and if allowed to continue the likely result would be hyperinflation and another depression. When you give the government the right to print money that isn't backed by anything, you give them the opportunity to steal quietly from the public without anyone noticing. Finally, every nation in history who has switched to fiat currency has eventually gone bankrupt, because the government couldn't resist the urge to hyper inflate the monetary supply, and make all of the money useless. Those who do not know history, are doomed to repeat it.
144	Absolutely. Almost 20 created yesterday (the 12th). The running average in the past few weeks is around 8 or 9 per day. There should be a maximum posted per day, possibly having someone elses to wait until the following day, either through a filtered bucket or something like that. Give people a chance to read current ones. Too many debaters are putting time and effort into the current open debates, and then having them fall further down the list, leading to less people reading and responding to them. (and I know someone will jump at the chance to call this open debate out as 'just another one pushing others down') but I felt this had to be said.
145	iPhone of course. Blackberry is now for the senior businessperson market! The iPhone incarnate the 21st century whereas Blackberry symbolises an outdated technology. The iPhone can reach a very diversified clientele : young, adult, active, rich, less rich population. The Blackberry have always targeted an elite. With the iPhone we are the elite and we can play spies as well as we can listen to cool music.
146	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music. Yet I would argue that America has birthed greater music. The whole bedrock of modern popular music is founded upon Blues and Jazz which as we all know originated in the US. Without Blues and Jazz there would be no Beatles, Rolling Stones or any other major British band pre 1977. Don't forget there's also Hip-hop and Punk. Both original American art-forms which have had a major influence upon the UK music scene since the late seventies and early eighties. In terms of popular music the US leads where the UK follows and adapts.
147	Obama = good judgement, steady in crisis, curious minded, cares about all the people not just the wealthy, wants to build a green economy, PRESIDENTIAL. McCain = ourt dated thinker, not curious minded, too ingrained into the system he claims to want to change, has stolen every good postion he has in this election from Obama, running a vile campaign and he approves the message, NOT PRESIDENTIAL.
148	I believe that it was a "learning experience" for our country. Without prohibition, who knows what would be happening now. I think that by having the prohibition law THEN, we were able to see that it didn't work and we can decide better on circumstances like that in the future. While it wasn't a strictly "good thing", I do not believe it was a bad thing for our country to go through.
149	Garry- No, I would not want to. 1 - You won't be able to see your friends, family members if you were alive for a long time. 2 - You will be so old that you won't be able to move around much. You will be sick. (Death's better than this!) 3 - Even if you feel excruciitiating pain, you won't die. (Suffering...) Torture...
150	I guess its good food if you're one of those people who like big burgers, but not me. I find it over rated. My girlfriend recommended it. The fries are good, very fresh. But I wouldn't go there for the fries. They have bags of peanuts that you can put into little paper bowls and munch on while you wait so thats kinda cute. The decor is like a 50's diner.
151	It is 6:53 pm and I wanted a juice. The clerk behind the counter proceeded to tell me that they have already sanitized the juice machine for the night. Pulp does not close until 9 pm. What a horrible experience and terrible customer service. Pulp does not close for over two hours. Really? I have been coming here for about a month and during that time the wheatgrass shot machine has been down. I figured OK it is a small shop how long could it take but a month later (according to a Nother customer it's been almost 2 months) and still no wheatgrass. Now this. I will not be returning.
152	I have been here before but now as Yama sushi has become so popular and big the sushi has 2x more rice than before and less fish, also the service has dropped. Also, they recently got a B- Health Inspection rating for 16 violations most of them being the fish not being kept at proper temperatures. Go somewhere else, or just make sure you get good service.
153	Since this place is close to where i live and it had good yelp ratings i figured I would give it a try. Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods.
154	The wait was only 20 minutes and we were lucky that we had a table outside. The food was very good and the service was great, but the wait was too long.
155	I ordered chicken chow mein and my coworker ordered beef chow fun. First of all our delivery took an hour! Second, our delivery driver dropped our Thai tea, thus cracking the lids & spilling tea everywhere. Next, he didn't have change! How are you a delivery driver with no change? Now onto the food.... My coworker said hers was "okay", not anything special. My chicken chow mein was disgusting! The noodles were extremely over cooked, leaving them gooey, soggy, greasy messes of dough. The chicken, I'm not even certain if it was chicken, had so much fat, gristle and muscle it was not edible! And the grease..... So much grease! If you are craving good, quality Chinese food, this is definitely not the place!
156	My husband and I went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary. They served him a steak that was so bad it ruined the entire evening. In fact, not long after that we decided to become vegan. It was that bad of an experience for two people who loved seafood and steaks. But at the very least we are healthier for it. Needless to say, we will not be returning.
157	I truly believe that wearing uniform is bad, because it is not helping students to express individuality. It is also very uncomfortable, and during winter time might be very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.
158	Firefox is better that's all I have to say.
159	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Just some reason why I prefer Firefox.
160	Honestly, firefox just works better. The tabbed interface, the lack of activeX, RSS support, what's not to love. Internet is trying to still catch up to firefox in my opinion.
161	firefox is much better. It remembers passwords with greater gusto. add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support windows. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
162	From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?
163	i like firefox and defend it, but what is odd is that this site is breaking in it.
164	I really don't know because i think it depends on who she killed and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.
165	I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me wrong I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take responsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me he wouldn't have killed someone.
166	No I would not because I would have taken a vow to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be crazy in the head but she would be my wife. If anything Id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.
167	No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldn't want him to go nuts and kill me too.
168	Books offer improvement with grammar and spelling skills. Plus it's more creative. With TV everything is done for you. With books you can imagine the characters looks and the setting with your own creativity in it. Plus you can take books anywhere and everywhere without disrupting anyone.
169	with the cream layer quota system i don't prefer india to be leading the world in near future..... yes india have the potential.. but corruption, this quota system ( not helpful to anyone), and the main reason brain drain, don't specialy help india in the matter....
170	It's better to be fatherless. Having a bad father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a bad father, for a girl, would mean having a bad boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
171	I would rather be fatherless than have a father that is lousy and does absolutely nothing. Most kids look up to their dads, but if they aren't good fathers, then why have them around? It just means that the kid will want to be just like his dad. Besides, you can't miss what you never had.
172	Raffles was the boss of farquhar and thus should be the founder of Singapore sine he was the leader and had more rights than farquhar. In addition, farquhar did not carry out his duties responsibilily and allowed slaves, cockfighting and murders everywhere in Singapore. Singapore was so poorly developed that Raffles was unhappy.
173	Porn is wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. Porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex. Porn inspires the idea that sex is totally based on pleasure, but it is actually based on love and affection also.
174	Are you a Christian...or anything? If not, than hey who's to stop you! For the record, yeah it's wrong. Unfortunately, it's impossible to argue that, if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs. Hence, my first point.
175	Why do you assume that god needs to operate within the constraints of time when accusing him of wasting his time?
176	Till there comes a time when FF come preinstalled in PCs.... IE will continue to dominate. enuff said
177	if the firefox is the best then why everybody tries to have IE compatible sites?
178	I was a IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not avaible in IE I don't find any other significant advantages in using firefox. Also now IE7 has got the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities. So I think IE is superior to firefox.
179	Fire Fox doesn't allow pop-ups on some websites like novanet. You need Internet explorer to install such websites
180	I use Firefox, but the fact is not all sites work well with FireFox, so until its completely mainstream I will pick IE.
181	Yes, because... 1st, It's a fun activity of the school day, that we get to have fun, and at the same time, do our excerse-- lose the weight we've been gaining, not all of it, but... 2nd, Obesity is certainly a problem in the U.S., so it would help! 3rd, People can have a moment that they'll eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it, like the fat when we sweat!
182	schools should have physical education because the school i attend only has pe for middle school not high school we are a middle and a high school combined. because the lack of physical education in our high school many students are out of shape and have developed many bad non active habits and as our first year in sports our sports athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre season conditioning and they quote "if we had PE conditions would be easier and would have made conditioning simple" the lack of exercise had caused them to only accomplish only 3 push-ups!
183	Sorry, one more thing: I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion....Funny how people just IGNORE what they can't or don't want to argue against. If you're going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This gives you a history of their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.
184	I support pro choice if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.
185	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
186	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, then we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. If it isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.
187	A woman and she alone is the one who should determine if she wants an abortion or not, at any stage of her pregnancy. Why is that it is mostly older white men who are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Why is it that most anti-abortionists are pro-death penalty? Jon Jax 71
188	Just a note to the creationists. Please use the "Convinced me" link correctly. You're supposed to click this if the person's argument convinced you that creationism is true. Some of you seem to be clicking anything and everything on the right hand side. This will not help you win the debate, by the way.
189	Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are religious claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
190	You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism --- At most you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where evolution and creationism can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea)
191	Not it's not. But along your line of argument, believe in "Creationism" and "God" is like believing that a puzzle can be solved by waving a magic wand. I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers would he? You clearly don't understand evolution. Read a book or two.
192	Whoever said porn degrades women is wrong. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)
193	I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is ebil 'n' degrading" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. As if there's no such thing as porn *actors. (What, men don't count?) Porn is a form of entertainment. No more. No less. Any arguement otherwise is just "Feminist" bullshit.
194	Porn isn't wrong, as long as you aren't doing it behind your partner's back. It's only degrading to the women who choose to show their bodies.
195	I feel like advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
196	This is very. bad as the uniforms are also cost effective
197	i think school uniform is really good idea!yes i agree that a lot of pupils don't like it, but however it have a lot of benefits. as previous people said children at first don't have to think about what to wear!because it is very big problem for teenagers.
198	Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality so if that relationship is damaged then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be fatherless because the damage of a bad father would scar my personality far greater than being fatherless.
199	I think that it is better to have a father who is not so bad because I consider my father on a low level of lousy, and I think that I'm doing just fine. I just think thats it better to know that you have a father. I think that not knowing him, or what he looks like would (to me ) be a insecure topic in my life. So, in my opinion. Just to know he exist would be better to me.
200	I would rather have a bad father than be fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would rather grow up with a bad father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
201	A drop of water is worth more than a sack of gold to a thirsty person
202	Yes it is creating SIERIOUS issues to the envirnment. When people finally realize that is in turn hurting us to as humans maybe they won't want that plastic after all!
203	The major water produceing companies are stealing water from our lakes and in that case killing off habitats for criters that like water like platypus.
204	The other side is only posting song lyrics, which has nothing to do with water!
205	He doesn't give high fives; only high sixes. He is the Godfather's godfather. He once taught a german shepherd to bark in spanish..
206	i believe books are more enjoyable (i believe i can fly...) so true
207	I think that television is better because it is faster and some people cant read
208	jesus loves plastic water bottles, and you cant argue with that claim
209	If being homosexual was natural then 1. There would only be possibly 6 people on the earth...meaning none of the people making up these sarcastic remakes would be around...heck I wouldn't be around 2. If homosexuality was natural then the butthole would be in the front part of the body. Its never been accepted as "natural" by society only till now. So i'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how its unfair.
210	India is projected to grow faster than any country of the world after 2012.
211	india can speak english better than orginal english man..britishers and americans speech includes a lot of grammatical mistakes..so who is better....indians!!!! "truth is stranger than fiction"..
212	we should not forget lord rama, krishna, vishvamitr etc which give view that india will be the vishvguru in future
213	yes it does with a rapidly growing population and a growing economy india is in line with china to become the greatest economic powers of the world
214	Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know. For example, I personally believe there isn't a God but I can never prove this definitely.
215	Atheism; I need at least some evidence before I can believe in ghosts.
216	I am an atheist because i believe that we all have one life that we should enjoy and preserve for all future generations
217	Christianity is perhaps the most vile ideal to poison the minds of men. It's uses, motives, and fictional stories are quite plainly immoral. (http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/religion.html) (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/whynotchristian.html) (http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/ 3956.Christopher_Hitchens)
218	Did i also mention that christianity condones enslavement? If so I'm sorry
219	spanking can be sometimes good for the child to understand but not to the point where it can hurt and should not be used repeatedly
220	I believe some parents should spank their kids but only when necessary because sometimes thats the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.
221	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
222	Spanking children will bad for their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children because it is not make sense.
223	Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has committed a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.
224	for everyone who is talking about RAPE in this subject let me ask you one thing!!!! if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!
225	when people condemned consensual-cannibalism in africa, did they think of these people's right to their bodies? no. why should abortion be any different?
226	What i dont understand is how people rationalize taking life it just doesnt make any sense... idc the situation in america how is killing legal?
227	EVERYONE, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be unhappy. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make civil unions illegal; it makes it too easy to "walk away" from a relationship and encourages roommates to be "couples" to help a buddy out with benefits.Civil Unions, gone, Gay marriage, IN!
228	If straights are allowed to get married and do whatever they want, why cant gays?
229	one reason is because so many more people agree with this side now
230	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person, so that you can then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.
231	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything to help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
232	At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
233	I believe we should be able to die with dignity. While there are obvious needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent from predators, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, then they should be allowed to request medications to end their life. I have watched relatives die of cancer; no-one deserves to be forced to go through that process unwillingly. Those that want to should get all the support they need; those that choose to die early should be given the means to do so.
234	Hypocrisy runs rampant in both parties. You know what would be a better way to select our canidate by having actual facts as to how the voted on any and all issues when they were in government. This way you know if this person is voting the way you want them to on the issues that are important to you. What was their absent record. After all aren't we all their bosses to some extent we put them in office. You know what irks me the most it's the wonderful raises they give themselves. If there is something that should be put in the ballot it's rather or not they should have a pay raise. After all where else can you go to work and decide gee I am giving myself a payraise. However it's all a bunch of propaganda with mudslinging.
235	The internet is still such a recent phenomenon, that laws and policies are being created as we speak. But unless you're pretty certain they'll be OK with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would be the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well. A lot of people create 'banners' for other people to put on their websites as a link to their's. But some people don't mind if you put the URL. Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you permission prior to your adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a matter of asking.
236	Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours. As far as I know, sexual harrassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening. Many people bend the sexual harrassment rules in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from their co-workers. I think that policies against sexual harrassment exist only for the workplace environment (which this environment may be). But I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
237	i totally agree with you, these days what with dna its easier to prove someone is guilty, so when its proven that someone is 100% guilty, hang em! especially paedophiles they are the lowest of the low as for ians answer it may of been proven to not prevent further people killing but at least its less of a burden on the tax payer supporting scum like that in prison
238	Personally I detest it, however, I find it a necessary evil since my husband and I own our own electrical company that offers 24 hour service. We get a lot of calls on our cell phones at night since we have our land line forwarded to our cells when we are not at the office. However, we always put our phones on silent/vibrate when we are in a public place. That way we don't disturb anyone around us.
239	You know I really don't see why not? After all people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16-Germany---and in Mexico the drinking age was 18 until now that it's 21. I think the reason why it's 21 is because people in the US are too stupid and dont' know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or anyother problems? Think about that!
240	I think not more rehab centers but better ones. In jail they will NEVER become a productive member of society in most rehab's they won't either and the ones that are GOOD are too expensive for your common druggy to pay for so they quit and end up in jail. Put the people who HURT OTHER people in jail not the ones who just need help or aren't hurting anyone but themselves. And if they are hurting family because of the drug problem my question is why doesn't the family get them help then support them with it. Too many people go to rehab and get out and the people don't even try to encourage them to get it together.
241	It is legal to use race as one of a number of factors is determining admissions. This was decided by the Supreme Court (Bakke decision). The ruling stated that race cannot be used as the primary factor in determining admissions, but can be used as part of the decision process. Although no company will ever admit to quotas in the job market, it does exist. Diversity is the new way of life to many people.
242	YES YOU CAN GET A TICKET FOR BLOCKING YOUR DRIVEWAY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IT ACTUALLY AGAINST THE LAW TO BLOCK ANYDRIVE WAY RATHER ITS YOUR OWN OR NOT, IF YOU BLOCK A DRIVEWAY AND AN EMERGENCY ARISES HOW WILL THE PEOPLE PARK THERE GET THERE CAR MOVED IF YOU ARE GONE ADN YOU DID NOT LEAVE THE CAR KEYS, THE OTHER THING IS WHAT IF EMERGENCY PERSONEL NEEDED TO GET TO YOUR BACK YARD ETC.
243	I think black people shouldn't say either because it still is a word that divides races. If 2 black kids are hanging out with a white kid and they call each other the n-word the white kid just wanting to be friendly is going to want to say the word too because he will always feel like an outsider if he can't great them in the friendly manner they great each other. But on the other hand I am one of the few African Americans who feel this way. And I do agree why does it really matter so much to white Americans. Okay you can't have this one word you have all the other words to use plus you run the world, is it really so horrible that black people have this one thing.
244	This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business. Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all. As for plural "marriages," they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them. That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different. In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
245	It blows my mind how people can be anti-capital punishment and pro-abortion. Either respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the liberal "don't kill convicted murders, but kill all the babies you want".
246	i think those kinda people that have children are just being selfish and are thinking about themselves..i mean think about the children...i wouldn't wanna have a mom and see her go through mentally illness...or a dad who is in a wheelchair...think a bout it...so my answer is no...give the kids a home where they have a mom who can bake cookies for them and a dad who can go out back and play baseball with them....so no, i do not believe that "everyone" had the right to have children
247	Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time? Man, you're just not getting the message, are you? If you are in California, you bet the police can take your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm. Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef. Voila - I give you California Vehicle Code section 14607.6...and a link to it below. It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California. You really need to stop driving. Really.
248	If the other 97% were banned, wouldn't those women start saying that they were raped, it was a case of incest, or that their health would not tolerate it? And then women would use metal hangers again, quite unhealthy. I do agree that cutting down on abortions in the US would be good, and birth control should be administered to anyone having sex.
249	It would be little differnt from owning a block of land most or all islands are either the responsibility of a near country or are called a protectorate of a country so even though you owned that "island block" you could not do as you wish.though there is a chance you could have local laws such as a town has but remember who is going to police them.
250	if your society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people on a racial basis then there is no difference between the two, because that kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighbourhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behaviour....simply because there are fewer and fewer alternatives, if any, available. if white anglo-saxon protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, then they'd pretty much match the criminal profile.
251	If you take bad advice from an Internet chat/question and answer site, it is YOUR FAULT! Stop trying to find ways to sue people. You are not hiring someone for legal advice on Yahoo answers. See a licensed attorney in your state if you need legal advice. If you do something EXTREMELY stupid as a result of a website, you were EXTREMELY stupid to begin with. Well, after all that, I would love to give you some case law and advice about liability, but that would be legal advice and my lawyer is not in today to write me up a disclaimer to add at the bottom of this.
252	Yes, it is. I've always been bothered by pricing based on age. Take movies, for example. A seat is a f*****g seat! Why should people between the ages of 12 and 64 pay more for the same seat? And what the hell is a "senior discount" about? I hear the same old excuse that seniors are on "fixed income". What does *that* mean? Aren't we *all* on "fixed income"? My income doesn't vary. In fact, younger people probably have more expenses than older people, with the exception of prescription drugs. And what is this "kids eat free" nonsense? Why can't I eat free? I mean, Geez, the kids aren't paying for anything. Let me eat every 5th meal free and I guarantee I'll come back to your restaurant. :-)
253	I agree. I don't smoke marijuana but think it should be legalized. Think of how much money the government would save/make. 1 The government spends loads of money to try and prevent people from using marijuana. With advertisements and all. 2 the government has to spend tax money to build new prison's, because so many people get arrested for possession. 3 Government could tax it similar to how they tax tobacco and alcohol, so they could potentially make Millions maybe even more. 4 police could spend time actually helping people rather than trying to bust people for smoking a little marijuana every now and then.
254	There is an old adage: "Sunlight is the best disinfectant". If you openly confront this woman, she will despise you for having exposed her misdeeds. If you anonymously send the General Manager proof of her actions, he may be inclined not to believe the accusations. You could have a meeting with the General Manager, and ask for anonymity. However, you must have all your facts completely established. Getting people to write their opinion will not be accepted as fact. You need absolute proof, and to show her INTENT to cheat and lie. She can always claim these were innocent mistakes or things done without her knowledge. Remember, you will need verifiable dates, names, events, and most importantly, a CONSISTENT story from each person who was a witness to any of these events. You do not want to come across as a whining malcontent. If you show indisputable proof, the General Manager will have to act.
255	I had the oppertunity to visit Dar just a couple of weeks back. And to answer each of your questions separately may be difficult for me. But maybe my observations while I was in Dar may help you find some answers to your questions. First and foremost, what I felt is that there is a general feeling of detachment in the general public. There is hardly any enthusiasm in whatever they are doing and have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told. There is great amount od tired, laid back approach to work and things can take forever to acomplish. I am sure Tz as a country has lot of potential, but if you ask me my opinion as an outsider if Tz can develop into an exemplary country, my response would Yes, but there is long way to go and a lot to change before that.
256	I often ask myself the same question. The sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his (Bush's) supporters with fear. They use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 to affect how we live. The crayola chart really is only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame. (public servants) In the name of'I don't like that party ', people will side with him as well. So Bush could have told people that he is the spawn of Satan and people would have still voted for him becuase they so much dislike the opposing political party.
257	It's not going to happen. People are free to make there own decisions in life. Maybe it sucks that there are such big consequences for it, but really you sound stupid! Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty. Maybe you should teach your kids about responsiblity and learn to talk to them about it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl were thrown into jail for that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discourage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
258	this situation has nothing to do with a lease...it's your business if you give the key to your apartment to someone, esp for the reason you stated. no extra person is staying there, it's not a sublet, you're doing nothing wrong...sounds to me like your landlord is way too nosey, you are most def within your rights.
259	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. Your part right on it never being used in a violent crime. I'm not sure where it happened but so far only one person in the united states has been killed by a 50 caliber weapon. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store makes it very unpractical for any criminal. When California passed the law Barrett actually ended the warrenties on the LAPD M99's, and then came out with the CA legal.416 rifle. Then all the black powder shooters started to complain so CA made an exception for.50cal blackpowder rifles!(which are easier to get by criminals)
260	Yes you do have officers out there that are racist. Its sad that you can not even trust the people out there that are supposed to protect you. But if you think about it, everyone is racist in their own little way. Some just do not even notice it. Racism is sad though and we should all look at each other the same way. People are kinda like crayons... They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors but we all still have to live in the same box.
261	If you want to ask for forgiveness direct from GOD through Jesus Christ, then be a Christian not a Catholic because a catholic's sins are forgiven through the pope or father of the Catholic Church. Catholics worship saints and idols like Virgin Mary and so on, whereas Christians worship only God in Jesus Christ. Those are just some of the many differences between Christians and Catholics. Pick your choice wisely.... If I'm wrong, do correct me. May God Bless you.
262	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists. Additionally, because they have been steadfast in the Global War on Terror, they are more likely to be attacked for maintaining that position, and terrorists are more likely to try to scare citizens of those countries. Therefore, the US and the UK have been more aggressive than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
263	I don't like the idea of burning the flag, but the freedom it's supposed to represent, should allow someone to do so if they want to. After all, what is being destroyed is only a piece of cloth. Making a law which prohibits us from burning the flag does much more damage than the act itself. You lose so much more by taking away people's freedom.
264	If that happens the US will pull all our funding and whatever troops that are under their peacekeeper control. Without US support there is NO UN. So they can try. I would love to get rid of that organization it has done nothing but steal, bad mouth the US and Israel, and waste our money. We haven't done anything that we shouldn't have anyway. Well the Bay of Pigs but that was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry.
265	The first amendment, among other things, protects the individual's freedom to associate with whomever he chooses. As far as I'm concerned, if two guys want to free associate, they can do it as much as they like. But the day you tell me that marrying another man is mandatory, that's the day when I leave the U.S.
266	Well I think ultimately its just going to be a gimmick, why would the large supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans etc when they don't have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their goods, and when we are all brainwashed on the money making "carbon footprint" idea how do you justify flying food round the world just to help the poor. I don't think that the social elite will go without fair trade or organic even though its riddled with GM, due to snobbery.
267	(pause here for deeply bitter laugh)...What an excellent question! Let's see, this is a poor woman? An immigrant? Not a middle class white woman? A woman whose family is not being torn to shreds over an agonizing decision about which they don't agree? This isn't an election year? The Shrub is in enough hot water with the public without having this situation getting the same headlines that Schiavo's case garnered? In any case, while I agree whole heartedly with your implication that the "Culture of Life" folks are a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites, I find that I am a little grateful that this lady was permitted to die without being at the center of a terrible storm of public controversy played out among people who don't even know her. Cold comfort, but it's all I have some days. I'm very grateful she had family with her, shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her mother.
268	Recently, we have seen Michael Jackson "release" an album of songs that he never wanted to be released. Likewise, Tolkien's translation of Beowulf has just been published despite his protestations that it is "hardly to my liking". Jackie Kennedy's private letters to a priest are even being auctioned off. I believe that this kind of behavior represents a deeply problematic invasion of the artists' privacy, and should not occur. If they are published, you and I ought to refrain from listening to or reading these works. In short, I believe the dead have a right to privacy that ought not be violated for merely prurient interest. Scholars and spies may have compelling interests in the material, but most of us do not.
269	Almost all problems seen today (and throughout history) with corruption in government is that we allow them to be bought with their own personal desires and selfishness. If we don't allow them to have the possibility of wealth, then we can put a stop to a lot of corruption. If a rich businessman gets into politics, he should give up all money and all other non-essential things. This will prove he isn't in it for the money, but for the actual job. I know chances of this being implemented are slim, don't use that as an argument.
270	I come from a family where my family was involved and to an extent still is involved with the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA were blowing up the Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to have territorial expansion into Northern Ireland and them wanting to be part of Northern Ireland was blantantly false. The Republic of Ireland has more or less existed by since WW1, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and sympathisers.
271	Incumbents have the advantage of being able to grant political favors immediately, better financing, gerrymandering, and name recognition. Challengers need a boost to make it fair. This would cause higher turnover, which would be good because: * It would reduce the corrupting influence of non quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last * High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists * When a majority of representatives are freshmen, they will be more idealistic and less jaded, and this will help them serve the public good I'm not sure what the best way to implement it is, but maybe just decrease incumbent's vote tally by 15% or so. My view is that something like this *should* be done, not that it's likely under present circumstances.
272	I'll start off with saying that I am a male myself and I consider myself an egalitarian, a humanitarian and a socialist. I don't like the feminist movement as from what I have personally seen from their views is that they are simply female supremacists anymore. However, from what I have seen is that MRAs are the same. I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (males being seen as all being pedophiles, women being able to get away with more socially and legally and males' lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors), however it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about it. However, that's just my view. Feel free to change it!
273	Misinformed voting is a problem, and I think that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, but would ensure that the voter had read the bill before they voted.
274	You know these cars with "systems." You hear the bass booming from hundreds of feet away. The vibrations shake your floors. If you can make out the music, it's usually terrible techno or hip-hop. These systems serve no purpose to the driver or the roads that they utilize. From a safety standpoint, the sound is a clear distraction that could mask an emergency vehicle siren, or passing car horn. From a quality of life standpoint, it's pure noise pollution, and a sign of pure inconsideration when a driver refuses to keep it down late at night. I feel the DMV should be performing a decibel check on all car audio systems, and they should not exceed the maximum of the car's horn. Massive stereo hardware should not be considered street legal. Reject their inspection, and impound them if discovered on the road.
275	I understand that religion can be good because it teaches good morals, encourages people to help others ect. I also understand that many conflicts have started because of religion or have revolved around religion, for example WWII, Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Another reason I think this is because of how other religions try to demonize one another. "Your religion is wrong and bad while mine is right and good! Let's fight about it!" There are also people and animals that are sacrificed for religion, people ignore science and rely on "faith", religious places (whether it be a church or temple whatever) are always asking for money. Censorship of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs, etc. Not to mention people are voted into office often because of their religion. Suicide bombers Suppression of logical thought You get the point.
276	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, I just don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science. I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
277	I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine and it occurred to me that while it's terrific that this discovery will end the suffering of infected people and eradicate the potential to put more through that sickness, it will ultimately result in an increase in world population.
278	I've played the game and beaten it, and I really don't understand why people love it so much. The gameplay is pretty much the same as other games, with the exception of the story, which is 90% of what people talk about when they say that it's a great game. A good portion of the game is either spent walking through a level, watching cutscenes, or engaging in combat or stealth, both of which are done much better in other games. Every time I ask why people love TLOU, I always get roughly the same answer; how it's an incredible story, and how it's so emotional. And this is certainly true, but what makes it better than other games? How does a good story make up for bland everything else?
279	All of these methods of killing result in long and painful deaths. Assume that mustard gas is only used on the battlefield and does not spread to other areas such as civilian areas.
280	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.
281	Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing: 1. Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc. I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the value of sex in society. CMV!
282	It's a lottery - luck of the draw. It will decide a winner, to be sure. But the better team doesn't always win. And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but they're a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.
283	I was born just early enough to completely miss the Pokemon craze. Being on Reddit, I see how it's become a cultural touchstone for the generation born after mine, but I've never had any contact with the cards or games whatsoever. I've seen some bits of the TV shows, and they look dumb. Really dumb. The games, from what I can tell, combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding. CMV that Pokemon games are aimed at kids and there's no point to trying them for the first time as an adult.
284	I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter yet when scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow. The jokes mask the reality of the situation and although a small percentage of the people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea is something we should be aware of and possibly take action to better the situation. I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights. And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang
285	The right to be married is currently denied to most gay people in the word. That is a cause worth fighting for and a problem that needs rectifying. However, what exactly is there for transgendered people to fight for? It is already legal for people who want to undergo hormone treatment and surgery to change their identity as much as scientifically possible.
286	Over the past couple of weeks I have attended or seen pictures for family member graduation ceremonies for kindergarten, 6th grade, 8th grade, and my daughter's high school graduation. I'm not talking about a simple gathering, I mean full out cap and gown, commencement speeches, hours long, etc full on graduation ceremonies. I feel that celebrating all these minor milestones in the exact same way as the final goal completely diminishes that walk across the stage for the student when they earn their diploma or degree.
287	Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men at Mount Sinai, as it says it was that amount that left egypt in the bible. Being that there 600,000 men, I think we can safely assume there were over a million people gathered. Now, even back then in ancient Israel, getting millions of people to believe that all of their ancestors were at mount Sinai and God spoke to them is an insane task. It would be EXTREMELY difficult to fake something like that and get a whole nation to believe it. Therefore, I believe that the national revelation proof makes Judaism the most believable religion. Islam and Christianity rely on the same proof and another leap of faith, therefore they are clearly less believable.
288	Take a situation where an individual is drunk at a party. Another notices him or her and requests to have a sexual encounter. If the first individual consents, then the individual has waived his or her right to accuse rape. This situation assumes the second party did not tamper with the firsts drink or, in any way, use the situation to his or her advantage maliciously (e.g. getting him or her drunk for the purpose of sexual intercourse) This was spurred by a discussion between me and my girlfriend the other night. I want to know the arguments for her side, my own being the one presented.
289	Coors light tastes like beer-flavored piss-water. Labatts tastes like a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in. Budweiser is for retards who don't know what beer is.
290	Really? Why would anyone want more? A $70k salary is enough for you to pay for comfortable housing, transportation, and expenses even controlling for cities. The average American earns much less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. So why would anyone want to earn more than $70,000? How would it benefit you? If you have a job that pays you a $70,000 salary, chances are you would have vacation time. What would an extra $30,000 help you do that you can't do with your existing salary? There's no marginal utility as far as financial comfort is concerned.
291	Anything intelligence created by a more intelligent being is artificial, correct? The creating being is the "real" being, while it's creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence.....if we were created. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love an intelligent being created by us? If not, how can god love me or you?
292	I think it depends on how the rich made their money. Some rich people came across their money honestly. They should be left alone. However, alot of rich people have come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means...by hiring 'illegal alien' workers who work for maybe $1-2 per hour instead of hiring a legal worker who they'd be required to pay minimum wage (Wal-Mart has been found guilty of this several times over the past years especially in hiring their janitorial staffs), by cheating on their tax returns, by pulling other accounting fiascos (just look at Enron), etc. Any rich person who has come across money through dishonest means...I'd say steal it all and give it to the poor because that's likely who they were taking that money from.
293	Before I began, let's create three base ideas about God: A. God is perfect B. God sees all C. God can do whatever he/she wants
294	Rowing is def. more intensive. The legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for distance or time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument of course assumes a person has cross-trained for each form of event equally. Not everyone is a natural runner of course but may have insane upper body strength, and vise versa. So it depends person to person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I'd have to say rowing.
295	I believe environmentalism is a great thing, but recently I think it could be categorized as a cult. They obviously have some great views and do help the planet, but the thing that ticks me off is "global warming". I think there is strong evidence that the earth is warming naturally because of the sun and not our production of carbon dioxide. But these radical environmentalists are literally attempting to form a kind of dictatorship, where so many aspects of life are strictly controlled to stop climate change. Anyone that questions them is a heretic, and even with overwhelming scientfic evidence against global warming, they persist. I am tired of overpriced "green" products, carbon credits, and attempts by them to waste billions of dollars and slow down America's economy.
296	Bill O'Reilly has an opinion. Sometimes his opinion seems moderately justified, sometimes not. Similarly, someone like Keith Olberman also has opinions which are sometimes moderately justified and sometimes not. Each can wield structured argumentation, and each will occasionally stoop to more base forms of persuasion. But it's all permissible because the main audience is content in just winking at the sleight of hand.
297	I agree with that Academic qualification ensures success in life because Academic qualifications ensure you have the basics in learning. If your basic grounding in Maths, Science and Languages is strong, you can achieve success in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, to innovate and to communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
298	A recession isnt ALWAYS a bad thing. An optimistic view of this recession is that all of the corporate world fat is being trimmed and weeded out, leaving only the best and most sufficient companies. The short term job losses and price increases are definably a bad thing but they are only temporary. The US has gotten out of worse before (Late 70's early 80's situation, and the Great Depression) just to name a few.
299	The present day crisis was brought on by the auto, petroleum, rubber and construction companies after WW2. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists developing solar energy, they chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building hiways and freeways, malls and depending on fossil fuel while destroying the envoirment This is just a case of the chickens coming home to roost,
300	Perhaps not all teens; there is a good case for new drivers. Perhaps in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees (I think there are restrictions on this anyway) should have restrictions on the number of passengers. Personally, I would also sugest a restriction on how far a newly licenced driver can travel on thier own, or with them as the sole driver. Obviously this would be very hard to police, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year from new drivers on thier first motorway jaunt.
301	Monarchies are just burdens to economies if they are parliamentary monarchy because they don't have they original role - ruling. There are many of examples: British monarchy, Danish monarchy, Japanese. They have no real power and no political influence and are just living on the backs of taxpaying citizen. For example the British royal family cost the UK 40 million pound per year.
302	No you can't. You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know. Examples: crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior. With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.
303	"Nothing exists." To utter that sentence - or even contemplate it - applies existence to something that is "nothing." Yet to argue that nothing exists asserts - paradoxically - that in fact, nothing exists.
304	In this case I do not believe that the Phelps Clan is protected under the first amendment. I think they crossed the line by singling out one persons funeral. At that point it's almost an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. Now, had they been somewhere else and been stating their beliefs against all military members or gay people then they would have been fine. But to single out one person in particular and hold signs up saying "Semper Fi fag" and "Thank God for dead soldiers" is a direct emotional attack and should not be protected under the first amendment.
305	In 2002 Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be funny she said that "her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics." The article cause quite a bit of controversy, this has to be one of the meanest things she has ever said. I like some of what Ann has to say, she makes sense some times, but you can clearly tell that she is making fun of mentally disabled people here. That is absolutely uncalled for and I think it's one of the worst things she has ever said...what do you guys think?
306	Uh, lemme see, at 82 years old, especially in the 40's, it may have been by natural causes. I think if the government wanted him dead, they would have killed him WAY before when he was actually inventing things which could possibly be related to weapons. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley... Those would be much more conspiracy theory probabilities.. lol...
307	I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out. A happy surprise was that it's taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be measly but there was enough meat in them that one would've been plenty. Better yet - they tasted good enough that I ate both. (Or maybe that's worse because I'm quite full now). The iced tea was fresh, restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies etc. I could've taken pix to show how much meat was in the tacos but instead, I ate them.
308	Relaxing place to be, nice terrace and good variety menu but only takes cash. Last time I was there the ATM didn't work either. They should at least have debit...or Apple Pay. Other then that. Order at the counter and food at your table. Would go back for coffee break.
309	The granddaddy of big box food. Tasty? yes. But not really inventive. Oil and butter as substitutes for inventive, creative food? Most likely. Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable.
310	The first time I came here, I ordered a latte and it was on point. I was happy to support a local business and the girls working were friendly. The second time I came in I grabbed a hot tea and a yogurt parfait.
311	The ambiance was good- very 60s Italian. I had the gnocchi pesto which was bland and didn't taste any herbs or olive oil. I'm not sure how that's possible. The pine nuts were just sprinkled on top which seemed lazy. Salad was brown. House Italian tasted like stale parm. Portions were lame for the price (usually you can count on a $14 gnocchi to be pretty hearty - this one would be a'small plate' at most other Italian joints). A very unimpressive $60 meal for the two of us. I'll be returning in the summer to check out "the most romantic patio in Cleveland," hoping another dish will be worth it.
312	our waiter was fine. very polite and attentive. that was the best part of the meal!!!
313	Sometimes a girl just wants some Matzoh Ball soup and this place is one of my faves... I will say it has been inconsistent from time to time (sometimes being less flavorful than others) but that is not always the case--- I have been satisfied more times than not. Sandwich selection is good, veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions. We often use Wheel Deliver to get the Smallman Street Deli and everything is always marked properly and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches unfortunately). I will keep patronizing this place...
314	i think we should not wear school clothes because their so weird and the good reason why is that no more bullying and also they're stupid and gay
315	Is this being argued? The only thing IE has going for it is that Windows has it pre-installed, and from what I've heard, they're going to get rid of that too. Everything from speed to add-ons, Firefox wins.
316	Mozilla Firefox can be used for everything! There are also plugins so that you can use the internet explorer engine in the firefox shell. It has many more plugins and the themes are a nice feature. all of the innovations in E 7.0 were in firefox years ago.
317	If my husband committed murder I wouldn't turn them in because I know he must have had a good reason to do it. Everybody makes mistakes in this world and this would be a wrong decision he took. I love him and I feel that in love we should be by our partner throught the thick and thin no matter what. I wouldn't want my husband to be in jail.
318	No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for each other through good or through worse and I would do anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I would not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.
319	More than likely I would not turn in my spouse, because there is that love that binds us together. But on the flip side, if it was down right cold blooded murder, yes I would turn them in.
320	I think books are better as TV can cause obesity as many people just sit infront of it, it has been proven to cause violence and it reduces learning. Also, books increase someones imagination and creativity as they have to imagine things in the book for themselves. I am not completely against TV but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people http://www.echoworld.com/B05/B0510/B0510TVBad.htm
321	As we know that India is fully filled with corruption. Each and every person have no time to help others, his only aim is to earn money in any way. Our manners and civilization are reducing and reducing every day.
322	India will never lead the world as long as no one can understand what they are saying with their accent ;)
323	i dont think soooo even as an indian citizen..because of soo much unemployment i dont think the gdp of india will increase in the next 5 years..they dont even have enough funds to feed all the poor..how can we even imagine them to lead the world..
324	It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. But, the reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.
325	I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a bad father. I personally know what it is like. My father was very bad. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and i havn't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disapointment. So I think that to be fatherless is much better.
326	Id rather be fatherless than to have a bad father. Having a bad father who tire to tell me what to do but doesn't do anything with his life would just make me mad. Id rather be raised by my mother who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works everyday to make money to put food on the table.
327	He revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people while Farquhar wanted to gain control through his actions.
328	It is wrong. Porn is wrong because you are being lustful: it's even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which is cheating on them. But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
329	Debates are based on evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. True. But, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory. Since the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.
330	That's your best argument - "Because they don't"? I thought there was a reason for everything... I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. How does an animal aquire a trait that it wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties" I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change And by the way, I'm just wondering, what insects are you talking about?
331	IE was there since then and is already installed in a typical computer. IE is UNIVERSAL! Firefox however needs to be downloaded or installed.
332	In my opinion I think that it should be obligatory to have PE classes in schools because it offers children a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes were obligatory there would be much less fat children. Of course also some health classes should be included so that children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.
333	Yes! and yes and yes and definately a goddamn bloody yes. Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital. Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat. Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times. Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having super great sex with your girlfriend(s)
334	Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
335	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.
336	Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, doesn't spare a thought at all. So what if he discovered the island majulah singapura, he did not help in the least in singapore's development. so why in the world should he be called'singapore's founder'? Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
337	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles.
338	Farquar weeded out many problems, such as the rat and centipede infestation. It took only a few days for Farquar to finish destroying the infestation, whereas Raffles did not do anything about the problem at all.
339	a common argument is, "what if the baby was to be the next daVinci?" there is a counter to this: what if this person who hets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.
340	Life has been around for billions of years, and any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same billions of years trying. :)
341	If you can, then please do so. Provide us with your facts! Do you have brain scans of the first humans? How about average organ sizes? Hair patterns? Facial characteristics? Heart rate records? Speaking of these factors, how do you account for the different racial characteristics of modern humans? I'm married to a Japanese woman. Why do we look so different? Was there in fact an Asian Garden of Eden? And an African Garden of Eden? And a... What do you actually believe anyhow?
342	I just don't see why it matters so much. We're here. Whoop-de-doo. So go on and live your life! If you want to believe in creationism, that's great, good for you. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is neccisary. Yet with all that said... Maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this. xD sorry.
343	I have to contradict phro and say that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur. For example, when different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
344	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. A loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
345	I also find it telling that there's (as of now) seven votes for "Porn is wrong", but no one is willing (able?) to say why.
346	Everyone has sex, so making a profit on it isn't wrong it's smart
347	Listen porn is not wrong because in schools that never give an accurate demonstration because of parents. Porn not only teaches but also gives prime examples.
348	The ability to do both would be amazing, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
349	I think that school uniform is a good idea. First it's make students look nice and tidy. Second we can know that who is studying in which school or who is in a same school with us. And finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time choosing clothes to school
350	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess bad fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or daughter to be as perfect as posible.
351	I think is better to have a bad Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
352	I think is better to have a bad father than a fatherless because you can count on your father. No matter what your father is always going to be there for you in the good and bad times. If you don't have a father you don't really know what is right or wrong. If you don't have a father than you don't have anybody to count with or tell your problems.
353	I would have to pick having a father than not having a father at all because, there will be a point where you may need his help. (It may not help but at least you tried.) I know that I have a bad father, and there are times that he gets me mad, but then again there are times where he does the dumbest things, and makes me laugh. I know that I don't have the father I want, but I still love him no matter how bad he is.
354	I feel like it's better to have a bad father than to not have one at all. If someone is bad at something, it means that there's always a possibility that one day they may be good at it. To be fatherless, there's not even a chance of having a good father. So to have a bad father would be better.
355	Estimates variously place worldwide bottled water sales at between $50 and $100 billion each year, with the market expanding at the annual rate of 7 percent. But in terms of sustainability, bottled water is a dry well.
356	television because only television can bring you live news at books you can't find also it's educational
357	you can get the "Foxtel Go" app on your ipad so you can watch television where ever and whenever you want.
358	you can just sit on the couch with some crisps or a burger or sweets and watch tv when you cant be bothered to do anything else
359	The water bottles are a safe source of water and are guaranteed to be safe
360	Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.
361	it is true that bottled water is a waste, but bottles can be reused!
362	If bottled water did not exist, more people would be drinking sweetened liquids becasue it would be the only portable drinks! People would become obese!
363	Two men/women together does not seem natural. Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible but it is obvious that God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem ironic in a way?
364	For anyone who tries to follow these threads of arguments and rebuttals, it looks like chasbas' argument which I rebutted on Feb 07, 2007 07:09 has been deleted, presumably by chasbas. I wish the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.
365	Guys AND Girls were made for a reason. This reason is not so they can pair up with the same sex. It is so that they can pair up with opposite genders. Opposites attract, everywhere, wether its in magnets, electricity, atoms, or humans. Besides, it just doesnt work with two guys (genitals), thats why there are female reproductive systems and male reproductive systems. They only work together, so there is only one way to reproduce.. Guy AND Girl!
366	Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.
367	its unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
368	Of course it has the potential, but right now the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent this. I can't think of a leading nation that has had large scale internal conflict, it just doesn't work. To "lead" a country must have time and resources to worry about other countries and not itself.
369	India and China could redefine what third world country means because in the future, both will be first and third world countries simultaneously.
370	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. With Athesm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
371	this is my big problem with christianity: why is it about belief. there have been horrible people who are believers. what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists. is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature od reality is???
372	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are christian or atheism. shouldn't it be "theism or atheism or other"?
373	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work.
374	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.
375	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be. Although I'm religious, I think atheists can stand to hear besause everyone is indepent and everyone has to have his own opinion.
376	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
377	No because hitting your child could mentally scar them for life and also it can make them think hitting their kids is alright.
378	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.
379	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder. Weather it was by accident or on purpose. If it was an accident then the police will figure that out. For example, what if your spouse murdered yours. Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself.
380	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
381	Actually the government does tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies It's illegal to commit suicide If a person is caught trying to hack themselves to pieces they could be placed in a mental institute So the government actually does limit what a woman can do with her body
382	No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant! When rape occurs why is it the innocent baby who gets no choice and dies? The baby is innocent, yes it wasnt the mothers fault but why is she more important than a child? Women have become selfish where there bodies are concerned. They believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we are talking about
383	what we are dealing with is indirect murder if a women decides to abort a child she just had killed a life that may have been a big contribution to society
384	while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory (especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.
385	Expensive, embarrassing for some, and unfair for AP students that aren't in varsity sports because varsity athletes can waive the class.
386	How can anyone say that Gay Marriage is wrong? It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs so who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?
387	Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the union of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.
388	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
389	There is no provision in either document you cite which says keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom. Now, our founding fathers were involved in colony govts before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights. When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation, we were not opposed to taxation. We never have been. You have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society. Plus, you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.
390	It sounds to me like you have big trouble. CASA - that's Community Alternate Systems Agency - is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If you took your child to a doctor or an ER and someone saw what they took for signs of abuse (bruises, etc.) they are bound by law to make a report. If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade. Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
391	The official reason is that they make an 'orderly market'. They must buy and sell to keep the market from sudden and dramatic shifts. But it is also true that they make full use of opportunities to buy and sell when they can make money. It's an unpleasant trade-off. I don't agree with them or with this policy but that's what is happening.
392	yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. your ex-wife is going to court concerning you. The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you.
393	The CIA leak was far worse. When Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent was revealed, her life, and possibly the security of our country, was put in jeopardy. Clinton's infidelity only directly affected Hillary and Chelsea, and was no skin off the noses of everyone else. One reason why the media devoted less attention to the leak is because corporations who own the media are major Republican donors.
394	I agree that a woman should have the right to chose and there are lots of children out there who have to go through foster homes and live very hard lives. I am pro choice. I also think that if it is made illegal then there are going to be alot of women dying from having abortions done in "hole in the wall" places that are not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions. I could never do it but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I think that when a person says they are pro life that they are not looking at the bigger picture. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that have been abandoned by mothers that didnt want or couldnt take care of these children.
395	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person. It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications. However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money. Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us. Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock. The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
396	This guy's actually got a point. I'm not so sure on the specifics of any yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances may have tailed off over recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore it because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
397	if you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again,then i say you should sue for compensation. money wont change what those evil bastards put you through.....but if you can get something out of the crap you have been through other than anger and bitterness,then why not. hope it all goes your way. u deserve it, your family deserves it.
398	Probably not. Not many people work for free unless there's a compelling social reason to do so (e.g. if you're protesting discrimination, etc). You MIGHT get someone to take the case on fee, which is to say they'd get a %age of the verdict. This will only work if 1) you have a good case, and 2) your case has a high potential settlement amount. Otherwise, prepare to pay. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) to get my training; I don't generally give work out for free unless there's a damn good reason. And no, "I don't want to pay" is not a good reason.
399	I don't want to turn this into a bash-Bush answer (I try not to get mixed up in that) But one thing I have noticed is his inability to be an effective public speaker. You would think he has the best speech writers money could buy, right? Problem is...I don't think he uses them...I almost think he just wings the whole damn thing, but who knows. I don't see a problem with speech writers to be honest, if your a president of a company, or of a nation, what you say will effect many people. Hiring someone who is skilled in speeches and public policy is not only rational, but almost the only choice to properly convey the message you want everyone to hear. If you really want to hear how a person speaks, debates are a good place to start, since even though they have official "answers" to expected questions, they do have to be on their toes a bit more than when they give an address.
400	First of all, the Constitution does NOT guarantee the "pursuit (or persuit) of happiness". That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law? I mean, take laws relating to age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds? In other words, how do you draw a line?
401	The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises not Lions and Bats. The reason one is legal and the other is not, is because the law says one is legal and the other is not. The actual difference between the two acts is hard to understand. For example, it is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have sex with someone free. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have film two other people having sex for money if you sell that film commercially. A rational, logical human being would never be able to understand this, which is why it is something only lawyers and politicians could come up with. The bottom line is they could make prostitution legal, they chose not to, they could make porn illegal, they chose not to. It is one of those cases where the difference is only what the court says is the difference.
402	Actually you have it wrong. The justice system developed and practiced in the United States is the best that has developed in mankind in all of history so far. It is far from perfect. It is flawed. It is human. But it is still the best we have come up with so far. No matter what media may claim and promote, it is getting better all the time, not worse. Because people do better and want better, we will become better for ourselves and our children.
403	You might be able to. Here's what I would do. 1. Gather all your receipts. If you don't have the actual receipts... well... you scewed and might as well stop here. However, there is the possibility that the old pharmacy has your prescriptions on file and they may be able to provide you with a print out of your purchases. 2. I really don't think the pharmacy will be willing to reimburse you... but the insurance company might. Copy all the receipts, write a letter and fill out your Insurance companies claim form. 3. Send it all in and cross your fingers. Good luck!
404	You shouldn't expect to get a realistic answer from anyone here because no one here (except you, perhaps), knows all the details of your case. It would take an attorney no small amount of time to prepare a defense for you, and nobody here is going to be able to offer you real help without knowing all the details. This is one of those situations where Y!A isn't going to be especially beneficial for you.
405	Give me a break. Three strikes equals life! Live with it! You've been warned so don't ask for sympathy because it's "just a little pot". It's not like the third strike was for pot only. He / She committed other crimes just didn't get caught. We as Californians are safer without them on the street. You know what they say... "If you can't do the time then don't do the crime.
406	Yes, if it's his baby. They're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound. The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in. Why assume the man left? She didn't say that in her question. She only said they were separated. Maybe the mother is the one who left!
407	Wait...you signed a contract KNOWING you weren't going to abide by it? And... the answer is YES. They, the property management, CAN place restrictions in the lease. Depending upon how the lease reads EXACTLY the key to this restriction is the word "loaded". Meaning you can keep an unloaded gun with a clip or speed loader nearby - It will be hard to prove either way.
408	Unfortunately, no you cannot re-open such a case, not without new evidence. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it probably won't help a whole lot. A very valuable lesson is to be learned here- you were so young when it happened- your body had many changes to go through yet and with Firestone's record, you should have had a clause put in the settlement (or not settled at all) that future consequences of the accident could be claimed.
409	If you do it in GOOD FAITH it is fine. However if you are doing it in order to yell "I have a bomb!" in public places and then justify it by saying you were speaking in your new language -- and it was your ONLY real purpose in coming up with a new language in the FIRST PATH -- Then it will not help you, and you WILL be convicted of "making terroristic threats".
410	I think it should be deemed as hear say and thrown out immediately. It is inadmissible evidence. They cannot accept this as a confession because first, his low IQ made him easily susceptible to coercion. He was coerced into confessing. Second, there is no proof he spoke the words he is said to have uttered and the wording and thought process are to complex for this defendant. He is to incompetent to be able to think of problems in logical progressions.
411	Well, since she signed for it, legally she can be held responsible for it. There is no way to get her name off the loan. The only way that she can try to get it off, is by disputing the signature on the promissory note, otherwise she's stuck. And no, he won't get off scott free either. They can take his tax return to pay on it. She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.
412	Because in order to deflect from the fact that most women are killing their babies because they're 'inconvenient', they have to do a lot of scaremongering. So you have the 'rape' and 'incest' scare factors, and throw in the 'back-alley coathanger dying by the 1,000's' myth, and you've eliminated the picture of a tiny baby being chopped up and vaccuumed out, or being burned in a brine solution, or having its head pierced and its brains sucked out. I guess the feminists are still following Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer minority children.
413	They don't do that. It's a hollywood thing. I've been to court many times (to observe, not as a witness or anything) and I've never seen them do that. They only ask you to raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar. That's all.
414	Are you sure that you are accurately reporting the information the attorney gave you? If your vehicle is parked on the private property of your employer, the laws of your state may very well give them the right to enforce this policy. Regardless of what you feel about the policy, chances are that you are an "at will" employee unless you belong to a union. I am not aware of any state or federal law that would protect you if your employer fired you for violating the policy. So you have two choices: (1) stop smoking; or (2) go off the property to smoke.
415	It's still considered a "right-of-way" violation. The driver with the legal "right-of-way" is the one with the green light, whether he's a good driver or not.
416	Doc, be very careful with this. I'm a writer and an ex police officer. These people will have you surgically removing their boots from your own...Send an official certified letter to the original publisher of the material along with a permission form to use their content. And, if they don't get back to you, extract the info from another source. Protect yourself my friend. Their lawyers will eat your lunch and not even leave you a Twinkie! Also, a disclaimer on your site is still a good idea. Tina
417	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other peoples opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty).
418	Yes i am completely for it. People are arguing that it is barbaric and inhumane but who can stand up and say that some perv who has raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live. We would put down a dangerous dog why not do the same to some of the scum that lives in our country. The justice system in britain at the moment is hopeless. Far to many people are gettin away with all sorts and something needs to be done!!
419	You admitted fault here and I bet that you admitted fault there too. Read what you wrote and you will realize that you have no argument in court. He did not write the ticket for not stopping for the stop sign. He wrote the ticket for "failing to yield to oncoming traffic at a stop sign." Big difference, if you were struck by cross traffic it becomes obvious that you did not yield to their right of way! Your best bet would be to plead "no contest" accepting the courts verdict without admitting guilt, it keeps you from looking foolish by trying to argue an open and closed case, and save face at the same time.
420	i try to teach my children to "treat others as you want them to treat you, not the way that they DO treat you". as far as i am concerned, two negatives only make a positive in math. therefore, torturing anyone or anything is COMPLETELY unacceptable. those who think that is acceptable are completely barbaric and would surely change their minds once they have been tortured.
421	That is just what I want. A felon with a firearm. Dont break the law, and you do not lose your rights. I hope that a nobody like you does not succeed in changing the law that our law abiding forefathers fought for. I am a law abiding citizen, and guess what? I have a license to carry a gun to protect myself and my home. I was able to get the license because I am not a felon, and I earned the right.
422	emergency petitions for psychiatric evaluations are NOT an arrest.. nor are they availible for review by an employer.. the American Disabilities Act prevents this.. and gives you ground for a law suit if it is used against you.. you do need to make your employer aware of your conditon.. if he fires you.. you will file a claim with the ADA.. chances are they will deny your claim if you didnt make them aware of your illness prior to employment.. after the ADA reviews this.. you will be given a "right to sue" letter.. (whether the ADA find validity in your claim or not-- you still have to go through this) only after the proceedings with the ADA can you get a lawyer involved.. he will argue that you didnt make your employer aware of your illness prior to employment because they would have not hired you in the first place.. many lawyers work probono and have a field day with employers like these.. bottom line.. mental illnesses such as Bipolar.. are a disabilty furthermore.. you may also be eligible for Social Security.. so you dont have to put up with narrowminded employers..
423	Well, it would have been nice had you used spell check first... Your question is hard to read for those of us that actually speak and write in English... So my answer to this is, which marriage were you speaking of??? I am on marriage number 3 and at my age it would be foolish to act like a virgin this far into my life... I know others that are in their 5th marriage; you think they should wait too??? Just exactly how much holier are you than the rest of us??? My previous 2 marriages had the exes walk out on me because of cheating, and I was not at fault... So we should study that aspect more don't we think??? I do not agree with your logic or attitude... Sorry... You could never make it work... How would you ever prove it???
424	I think it is usually acceptable to break the law if, by not breaking it, someone would suffer bodily harm or death. Also, if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate against people based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin, I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court, for example when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.
425	Okay, so I would never let anyone know this publicly, hence the post, but I really did enjoy Battlefield Earth. The acting is pretty poor, but it is at least a decent Sci-Fi movie, with a good amount of action. I liked the thought of post-war America, has some shout outs to ft hood, knox, and a couple other famous cities. The learning machine allows the humans to become intelligent, travolta getting his comeuppance at the end. I gotta say, if it is on, I tend to watch it. Just to Give a Primer, my 5 favorite movies of all time (in no particular order) Shawshank, Godfather, Inside Man, Animal House, Goodfellas
426	Before anything else, here are definitions via the oxford dictionary Pornography: "Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings." Explicit: "Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion" I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because it was "pornographic" when the text is not sexy or titilating - just descriptive. Some dont even include real descriptions of sex at all... I cannot find a citation right now [on mobile], but i have heard many people say that pornographic is to be defined by the community Without an understanding of the difference between pornographic and sexually explicit, community members are not at liberty to define either term.
427	This is maybe more specific to Canada, but I really don't care which candidate wins what or what party they belong to. I feel like regardless if it's the Liberals, Conservatives, or NDP (read: the parties that could realistically win just about everything), some good things will get done, more bad things will be done, there's a 25% chance of some major scandal, and there will definitely be corruption. And then there's the fact that every incumbent cancels out what their predecessors put in place to put their own mark on things and this just continues in a cycle. This is me looking at the situation without my own political beliefs. For example, if I am in favour of subways and only party X is, I am not taking that into account.
428	Instruments have such extreme limitations compared To a normal composition programs that I think they're obsolete in the modern musical world. They have imperfection, and you cant control the frequencies of the sounds you're making as well. People will spend years learning how to make a single sound, instead of all possible sounds. When you play an instrument, you're just a drone, an atomaton playing someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier vs being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.
429	I've been stuck with this debate with myself for months now, and I can't think what is the right moral path.. I've always thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food and not fun, is morally right because there animals don't understand death, like a human does. They will have the same wonderful life, in the wild, even if I kill it or not.. As for producing animals, in order for food, I also think this is ok as long as the animals are treated right, and fair. That's why I'm a vegan right now, because I hate how the main meat sources we have come from horrible people who treat animals with un needed cruelty, or atleast it seems like they do.
430	Reason being: -My expected degree is in the scientific field, and a bachelors is a drop in the bucket in that area as prestige comes when a PhD is reached normally. -I have little emotional connection to the college I am finishing. -The college is not prestigious/well known for the area I am studying, therefore the coursework was not as rigorous as could be and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies to me little dedication towards studying and finishing my course work is frankly embarrassing. CMV.
431	After a marriage ends, if a pre-nup wasn't signed that is, one partner usually receive alimony from the other. I think this is wrong, and selfish of the people who receive it. If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid I think. If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options. Obviously if they had kids together the partner should send the person the kids are mostly with child support to help take care of the children, but money just to take care of the adult they didn't want to be with anymore? hell no. They can get a job. CMV!
432	Watching documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. I think the Melvins said they were a bunch of bums who hit the jackpot. Well I have gone back and listened to a lot of those other bands and i'm sorry to say I never heard anything close to a 'Lithium' or a 'Smells like teen spirit'.Those songs are magical and have beautiful, haunting and unforgettable melodies and really good pop hooks. There were other great bands that are in the same league like Pearl jam and to a lesser extent Alice in Chains and Soundgarden..but no I dont buy the Spiel that Nirvana were 'just another band'.
433	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments that I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about Spaghetti? Quoting the Transformers movies? Karma is spilling out and overflowing and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can't you people have your own thoughts, or is every concept you grasp dependent on it being intermediated by a career actor mouthing lines that have been signed off by a committee of movie company executives? I'm sickened. Only the first person to tell me "Frankly, my dear, I don't care" gets an upvote. None thereafter.
434	As an academic definition it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with based on historical and present discrimination- but it seems like wherever it's used outside sociological theory it instead is an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with. E.g., "You're privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid" I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem, rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions really are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong.
435	This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are hunters more morally and ecologically irresponsible than poachers? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit. Anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.
436	The realism in games such as call of duty and battlefield mirror that of the cop and soldier training simulators designed to teach people 'killing styles'.
437	Now I know this sounds crazy, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hides a problem. When a third world nation is supplied with free food it can distribute to its people any form of farming or other food production of that country suffers. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in said country, their livelihood will be ruined by rice which is freely available to the population. If any kind of donations are made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize farmers of the third world countries which would allow cheaper food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these countries.
438	I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts. If you're smart, you can be a wheelchair bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking. He's got almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He's still successful. You could be an African-American/Pacific Islander transgendered/multisex pansexual with chronic diarrhea, paralyzed from the neck down, and a triple amputee with body dysmorphia, but if you've got a 190 IQ, you can become rich. You can be famous. You can have a pretty good spot in life.
439	I believe that no one should be allowed to be a permanent member and that the 5 countries with the largest influence on the world (defined thru a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records). Countries who fall far enough in any of those will lose their seat. As for the rest of the seats they would be filled as they currently are....as for veto power I believe that it is overpowered, for proof of this look towards North Korea...I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to get action on an issue I understand that this is 2 part, but they go together so I thought it should be ok to put them in 1 CMV
440	This isn't referring to depression because of a terminal illness, but specifically about clinical depression prompting suicidal urges for years. Decades even. I don't view suicide as a choice - it's a fight or flight response. Some people cope others don't. Also my philosophy on the value of life undoubtedly skews my stance. I don't believe that anyone has an objective, inherent value and that disallowing someone to end their life promotes their suffering for the comfort of society being uncomfortable with death. However, temporary bouts of suicidal behavior should be treated but at a certain point it becomes so chronic that pain overshadows pleasure. When someone has suffered for years with suicide but have held off because of guilt from family they are literally tortured into accepting life rather than be allowed to bow out peacefully.
441	I do not want to come off seeming that I'm speaking ill of the dead. I honestly hope I do not come across that way. That is not my intention. Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has and here is why: She ruined both her marriages because she slept with other (married) men. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement) but she should in no way be considered a role model to women. Any woman that exhibits this kind of behavior today would be considered to be an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone?
442	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to despise Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after despite massive public outcry. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her. But recently to my disbelief I met a man from London who believed she was a great leader. She is also referenced as "The Iron Lady". I cannot stand this woman and how anyone can infuriates me.
443	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVES the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting, etc. Now I don't hate the movie, but most of my friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year. I thought Gosling's character was very bland (yes I know he's supposed to be some sort of sociopath) and I felt like he was nothing more than a pretty face who had violent tendencies. The other actors were good, Cranston specifically, but nothing award winning. The soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to 'top 10 movie of the year' status. All in all I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere. Viewers who loved it, can you CMV?
444	I am highly against HFCS because, in short, it kills people. While I understand it is cheaper, it is by no means better. Examples. 1.) Any type of artificial sugar can cause obesity, or even cancer. 2.) Factories that produce HFCS are very unregulated by the FDA. Tests have proven that there are contaminates of mercury in some batches of HFCS 3.) HFCS and cane sugar are NOT biochemically identical, and our bodies do not process them the same way 4.) The corn industry is VERY corrupt and has been causing local farmers to go out of business, having a detrimental effect on the US economy
445	This happens all the time online and in real life. Someone says something and another person says "that's racist," which is their trump card that they feel immediately discredits the other person's entire argument.
446	They aren't really on the same level. Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different. FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam. Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to. The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.
447	Although eBay serves only as a market medium for connecting suppliers with consumers I would say eBay is better from an economic perspective. With no firmly set prices, eBay's market closely resembles an internet-based free market... where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. In otherwords this is a self-targetting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency. Amazon on the other hand used to use consumer price-targetting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targetting. Now they are setting prices based on what the product suppliers are setting them at, they may not be working at optimum efficiency.
448	final fantasy is better because if you look at it compared to kingdom hearts final fantasy has better graphics and a better story line. i must admit kingdom hearts has some good features but you fight little black creatures called heartless and grey empty bodys called nobodys. and the biggest ruiner is that you do it all with a key. plus some final fantasy games are turn based but that just makes them a little better. the final fantasy trilogy has been out since the nes i have played the first final fantasy (the original) so i can honestly say that not only has final fantasy been out longer and had a better run than most games but you cant beat final fantasy 7 on rating any day. also in kingdom hearts 2 you can see tipha sephiroth and cloud but with different names like roxas is the kid form of cloud. i rest my case.
449	Arguments about the existence of God are in fact useless. There have been logical arguments presented, but they can be disproven using more logic. It can be reffered to David Hume's "Matter of Facts." This says that a matter of fact can be presented but not be disproven. There is no concrete arguments that can be presented to prove or disprove his existence, thus making it useless to debate about his existence or not. It all comes down to faith.
450	Global warming is an issue that affects the whole world, hence the Global bit. America seems to pride itself on being a country with no qualms about rushing into another country to'save' and 'liberate' it from evil forces (even if the rest of the world dosen't always agree). If the US is serious about helping the world, then it needs to pull its wieght on the Global warming problem. As one of the largest C02 producers in the world, the least that Bush can do is pledge that the 'Last World Superpower' will cut down on its contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day.
451	The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is IT DOESN'T WORK. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy right out of "24". That just does not happen in the real world. Another point against it: aren't we supposed to be the good guys? How in the world do we expect to keep our supposed moral superiority when we debase ourselves by stooping to the level of our enemies? If someone wants to argue we need to get down to our enemies level to really be effective in the war on terror, shouldn't we have rounded up all the German-Americans in WWII and burned them in ovens? Shouldn't we have gotten down to the German level to be really effective? I don't think the U.S. can seriously dictate to other countries when it doesn't follow the dictates of its own Constitution.
452	2 reasons: - Let all babies be wanted babies. Knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be emotionally devastating to some. - Anyone who doesn't want their baby so much as to have them terminated would not be a good parent. If they could care less about their child, the kid will grow up uncared for and possibly even abused, malnourished, or neglected. Here's my solution: once you find out you're pregnant (unintentionally), immediately look for an adopter, and if that fails, get an abortion.
453	The poor need help! The rich will get richier and the poor will get poorer unless we intervene. And having poor people exploited is bad for society. No heathcare, no political and legal representation, and there will be blood spilled with a revolution (as we have seen in Cuba, Russia, and China), and it will usually result in a dictatorship. This does not mean taxing people 20%, rather, it just means making it a societal goal to help the poor and invest in the people.
454	I just watched the original debate in the Houses of Parliment on TV (some programme about Tony Blairs legacy) and it made me wonder about this. I have to say that I think if the steps had been taken to secure a binding resolution the added benefits of having all seven member nations on board would have averted much of the disasterous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
455	Recently, engineers have recreated the diesel engine. No longer is it the loud smoke chugging brute of an engine. Rather, it now has mileage that rivals hybrids (a new VW diesel car gets 75 miles to the gallon, beating out the Toyota Prius) and has more eco-friendly emissions than ever before. Its not smart to bank our future on fossil fuels and the like forever, however until we get more efficient electric/other technologies it seems like a great stepping point. (also, hydrogen as a combustive fuel is being researched right now and seems quite plausible as well)
456	No, I didn't create this debate, and YES I will be standing up for Rugby. It occurs to me that Rugby is the superior sport for three main reasons: 1) Rugby is a combination of the two most basic forms of athleticism, running and wrestling. And they run a LOT. Like constantly, coupled with constant attack and defense, with no time-outs and no dead plays. 2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors. 3) No pads. Rugby hits are just as hard, but there is no armor to stop the blow. Skills are just as complex and beautiful, but the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers. Sport in the raw.
457	This is a no brainer, coffee has no medical benefits, keep in mind that being a stimulant and tasting good is not a medical benefit. On the other hand going back over 5000 years marihuana's active ingredient THC has been used fro many health beneifits, moroever the stalk, leaves and seeds have been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothings and other materials as well.... No Contest! Marijuana places high above coffee
458	Absolutely not. Why am I obliged to provide for my neighbor? You're in effect forcing individuals to make contributions to charities without their consent. Set up voluntary support associations, with reasonable criteria for the support applicants (e.g. they're in the process of trying to get a job/education), and then I'm interested. Provide tax breaks to those who contribute (this already happens when you contribute to a recognized charity). Provide insurance benefits only to those who've contributed in the past. Even require applicants to pay back the dole they've received, if you wish. But don't tell me what a worthy cause is. That's my decision.
459	College athletes do get paid. Going to college costs money, if they are good enough and maintain a gpa they receive scholarships which are essentially debt relief. There is no difference between cashing a check for $1000 an using it to pay a credit card and a scholarship for $1000. The question here then, is not whether or not college athletes get paid, but should college sports be for profit? If it is a private school the answer is automatically no.
460	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. By starting fires in civilian areas, the group fits the definition of terrorists. As noted in the news article, the fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. We cannot limit our concept of terrorist to Islamic radicals. Anyone striking civilian targets with violence with the intent to send a message or spread fear should be considered a terrorist organization.
461	Just like any other private schools, religious schools earn money from their own pupils money which goes DIRECTLY to THEM and is not subsidised in any way unlike public schools who have to use community fundraisers and events. The money given to private instituations like these is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity... you do not know what they are going to do with it and how it will benefit their students.
462	I don't exactly see how cutting someone's hair, like a child for example, would straighten them out. For most kids, it wouldn't really teach them a "valuable" lesson. I can tell you based on personal experience. If you can properly discipline your child, then there's no reason to cut his/her hair as a punishment. If it does come to punishing them, there are better ways for them to learn what they did was wrong.
463	Criminal gangs are criminal gangs - regardless of whom they are made up of. If the police is not allowed to protect the population from criminal gangs, ordinary citizens will take up arms to protect themselves. While it is understandable, this is not good for the rule of law. Therefore, 'political correctness' must not be used to prevent police from doing their jobs and keeping the public safe.
464	I was very disappointed with this place. Been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always leave full and happy.... came here after hearing all the hype about pho and wasnt happy. I totally would pick ramen over pho any day!!!!
465	This place is pretty ghetto. They had to break up a fight around 11pm and there's only about 25 people here. I'm also looking at a girl who's basically nodding off at a table, and it doesn't seem like it's from alcohol if you ask me.... Server was alright, they were out of 3 types of tacos as well as sour cream, which is pretty strange for a Friday night. Service was a little slow for a weekend night. We had a good time due to the company we were with but we probably won't be coming back for the next girls night.
466	My family always ordered from # 109 for over 10yrs, our house number ends 4949 and I, Sherie Arvayo, call from my cell, just lately the persons who answer the phone are very disrespectful when they can't hear what i'm saying and who ever answered at 4:59pm today rudely hung up on me. 2 months ago they messed up our order and whomever the manager was must have taught the employees how to act and talk unprofessionally. This is about the 4th time the employees have been disrespectful and mean. We decided to go with Papa John's for at least their employees are professionals and friendly.... I hope they close this store because you never know if or what they would put in our pizza!!!!
467	Usually we have had a good experience here. On this latest occasion I was disappointed with the service. Food was fine but the lack of attentiveness and overall demeanor of the server will prevent me from coming back for quite awhile. What really fries me is when the bussing of the tables is slow. Also, instead of letting us relax and order drinks the server took our drink and dinner orders at the same time. Take the drink order first and let us look at the menus, please.
468	I'm a regular here and absolutely love this place. It's the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time.
469	The bartender was rude and immature. She was eating at a table and was the only bartender, which meant having to go to her to get drinks. There were very few people despite it being a Saturday evening, and I understand why! We asked for chips and salsa. She said they only had nachos. We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us. So....hmmmm, I guessed they have chips (nachos?) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her and her response was "it's not on the menu". I suggested that next time she should go into the kitchen and ask them to throw chips in a bowl and salsa in a bowl and bring it out. She told me I was being confrontational. I told her I am in the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out, she rolled her eyes. We will never go back there again.
470	We just went over for drinks. Our friend had the Mac &a Cheese and she said it was really good. She even got some wings to go cuz her man loves them. The outdoor seating was super chill, although that day they allowed some kids to come in and they were definitely annoying. Other than that I think it's a really cool and chill place to hang and drink.
471	The last thing which a school ought to do is attempt to hinder the creative expression - the individuality - of their children.
472	it dose not show kids expressions and unforms does not show is it
473	I want to mention about wearing school uniform by high school students. it really makes no sense, it's the opposite, it just makes troubles within students and teachers relations. People aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about the controlling person's behavior - it must be done in the childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.
474	uniform doesn't mean better learning at school (students go to school to learn to prepare for their future, not to waste money to buy uniform ).. NO CONNECTION BETWEEN UNIFORM WORN N SCHOOL RESULTS...
475	Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix). And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs em!)
476	There's no reason at all why anyone could say IE is better. Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and sleeker. You can customize it to look any way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!
477	Of course not! Absolutely not! Its something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she would definitely learn from. She was brave enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people would do. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not told anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!
478	If my spouse committed murder, I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite. I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, so there or it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in the one I love.
479	Have any of you noticed that those who are against books are the ones who have weak arguments. Like that person who just said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because it rots the brain.
480	First of, India does NOT have the potential to "rule" the world because have you seen the people? Good Indian people with good minds are in some foreign country getting a Nobel prize while the others are just stuck ups who don't do anything and push the people who come up, down. Nobody actually lets anyone succeed. That's why!
481	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
482	This argument could go both ways but I would have to agree with being fatherless because to me a bad father is a father who is never there when you need him to be there or, he is never there to listen to what you have to say. That's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.
483	I think both being fatherless and having a bad father is depressing. But for me i would prefer to be fatherless, because at least you know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if i had a bad father and not to care about me. In this case i am in the middle of this two choices, that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason. But i still need him here to support me.
484	When Raffles came back after a period of time, he changed rules and concepts Farquhar had set according to the people's needs. This can be seen as showing that he cares for the people.
485	Even though it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas
486	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVER" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names "raffles institution" "raffles hospital" raffles medical clinics"
487	Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts turn out to have intimacy issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about... But it tends to screw up their reality.
488	I become suicidal thinking of the one i love most getting off on other women.
489	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s, and when it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
490	There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared.
491	What I meant was that in the situation, both moths were present at the time of the observation - both colored moths were on the trees to begin with... "Then the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution." -Who selects this mutation to occur? Does it just happen by good fortune?
492	In the 21'st century, we have come to a point where the only way for us to evolve is to start to create. However, creation is evolution just with more responsibility placed on humanity.
493	Could a higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
494	spam and adware seems to be more compatible with IE.
495	I feel like Physical education should be mandatory because people need their exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of PE because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around.
496	of cz phys ed must be taught but mustn"t b compulsory coz sme of us are not fit 2 du the extensive exersises perfomed
497	This will help kids learn good qualities like leadership and discipline. This could also lead to help childhood obesity.
498	Definattley all those obese kids need excersise and its a whole part of life, of course it should be mandatory.
499	I agree with everything she said because children should learn how to live a healthy lifestyle. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so less people in our country are less likely to be obese.
500	yes! our kids are so out of shape for the most part and eat too much fast food
501	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea but the implementation was left to Farquhar so i believe he is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.
502	I like to think both are true. 1. God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man) 2. Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings. (there is proof of this, you can not deny this. i do not know if we came from monkeys or not.) I believe in God and evolution.
503	There is not a God. I just use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments.
504	Define "order and detail." Existence isn't a BMW. You are falling for the old 'watch maker' argument. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment. A good read: "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins. Not as aggressive as his more recent "The God Dilusion," but equally well written.
505	All these arguments about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me now -_-. Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
506	NO. I am a female who watches porn. It does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn. I think its natural for people to have sexual desires. If people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it. But, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.
507	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.
508	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.
509	Simply Written Seeking to advance the Common good allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey (or) series of considerate acts one can have an less-difficult time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. The word for this debate is [sacrifice] How much would a person really "sacrifice" for his or her neighbor without being blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? No matter where a person is in thier life.... Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
510	They prepare people for the clothes they may have to wear later on in life. They also ensure that no inappropriate clothing is worn.
511	I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a bad father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up to life could become harder or not good.
512	Its better to have a bad father then not have one at all. Even if you have a bad father you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better". Even if you have a bad father he is going to love you no matter what.
513	I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had a bad father even if he had no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or bad father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.
514	well with our water bottle consumption on the planet earth, we could cover all of mexico 3 times, of course that would be a lot of "rich" in their mind Mexicans.
515	Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price.
516	TV is better because you can explore the world while sitting on a couch
517	I learned English through TV. Although technically, I learned English through interaction with native speakers, TV helped a lot more than books.
518	It Improves academic skills of a child.Television has made children enthusiastic and confident. As a result, they improve their academics and increase their ideas and innovations!!!
519	Bottled water consumption has grown exponentially over the past ten to fifteen years. This growth has taken place globally, but particularly in Europe and North America. The bottled water industry has literally created its own water culture which is beneficial for american industries.
520	Bottled water is not our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits. All other beverages consume huge amounts of water and energy during their production processes, which makes their ecological impact far more detrimental than that of bottled water. http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address;=103x347180
521	Gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.
522	To say India can not lead the world is to say that a newborn child can never walk!!! I agree that there r so many problems that the rising India is facing 2day, but we r getting better day by day!!!
523	Hi all of u.................. dis is a new gal joining da prsns who r in favor of this argue..... those who are opposed to this topic..... may i request u one thing dat plz think before u tell about India"s potential bcoz the wealth which the foreigners are enjoying nw are the looted one 4m India..........
524	yes, India has potential to lead the world.so, many countries depends on scientists.most of employees in every country is Indians.
525	religious people are always using the same argument: you cant prove he doesn't exist!!!!you CANNOT disprove a negative. meaning, you cant prove something is not there,which already is not there.
526	god aint real, so get over it u naive belivers of god
527	I think spanking should be an option. However, I believe it should be a last resort.
528	I believe that spanking your child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
529	I have a personal relationship with Christ. I am a believer.
530	Christianity, of course. Can't imagine life if I didn't believe in God. Actually I can, it would be hell.
531	This is just wrong we should not insult who we believe in we do not need to know what you people think
532	This is the most ridiculous debate i have ever seen. HOW you tell me please hoe did we get so perfect were the earth and sun and moon is in the right spot and are bodies function perfectly are hands made distinctively. Cause we were made after his own image.
533	People should not hit there kids because the kid will think it is OK to hit someone else back like for an example at school they will end up fighting and abusive to others.
534	No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do, and their parents need to teach them different ways.
535	Is personhood absolute or is it predicated upon position? If a premature baby is lying in an incubator or, let's say for the sake of argument, a 5 gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because the child is inside the womb?
536	I choose life because keeping the law pro-choice is allowing women to murder their own unborn human child.
537	No. PE has been around since more than 200 years ago. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect, mainly because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
538	Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience. Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.
539	Well Well Well. I had muscle cramps all over when I was doing intense exercises like doing a long run. You know, people are all made different, some maybe have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and are only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?
540	Physical Ed causes many problems. Also, we shouldnt need Physical Education to graduate school.
541	A person should be free to do as he or she pleases. So in my opinion i really dont care much about gay marriage. I think it is in a way wrong but it doesn't really make that much of a difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion. Life is what you want it to be
542	I think it all depends on the individualist's point of view. We have no right to go against it. Different people have different point of views.We perceive that gay marriage is weird and disgusting but they might feel the same way as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no right to question one's perceptions. We humans are very selfish creatures we only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.
543	It is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful. We only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.
544	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.
545	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.
546	No one enters suit justly, no one goes to court honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity. Therefore justice is far from us...Judgment is turned away backwards, and justice stands afar off; for truth has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter. Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.
547	CarCraze --- you are wrong, sorry to say What you have there, my dear, is a bona fide Court Order for you to appear in court to answer to a Motion to Collect a Debt. If it is on Court paper and has a case number, call the Court to confirm the Docket Number, and find out when the hearing date is. YES, they do have that power. YES, That is the equivalent of a Subpoena. If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it GONE! What you should do: Seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you. DON'T HESITATE - you will regret it.
548	None of us has time! but... it is your civic duty to participate now and again! There are specific criteria that will relieve you of jury duty, but you still need to show up and allow the judge to review your petition/request and dismiss you legally. As far as trying to act like a jerk in the courtroom and prejudice your responses, be careful-you can be held in contempt and perjury in a courtroom is very expensive!!
549	Ever since Bush got away with tax-payer dollars funding Faith-based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional but no politician will touch it in fear to be painted anti-church, there has been a movement in this country for more religious or power of the church. People don't realize how powerful the catholic church is. Do a little research and check out how wealthy they are. It will shock you. There is no way they are going to like China not 'obeying' their (not God's) rules.
550	Australia has no basic human rights under the constitution. We have no Bill of Rights like in America. Any rights we do have are established by the courts. In relation to your issue, contact a women's legal service or a women's shelter for advice about what you should do. The question may be whether he has bashed the baby as well (or is likely to), but I am not a lawyer so dont know for sure.
551	It can't be handled in one trial. Theft is criminal, and malicious prosecution and breach of contract are civil. The DA won't touch them. If you don't have a lawyer to bargain with the DA, then your best bet is to sit tight, gather your evidence, and defend yourself at the criminal trial. If the DA wins, your case may be sunk; but if the DA loses you will be in a better position to sue the witness whom you believe lied. You can sue in civil court, and you might be able to sue in Small Claims without a lawyer.
552	Bush fears it will put US at risk of loosing the edge in industrial production. The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in america. To adhere to the standards america needs to upgrade a large number of industries. Another reason is these agreements will be fully implemented in usa but the other third world countries does not have the financial power or expertise to implement it. So the third world countries will be polluting and producing cheap products while US will be investing in new technologies and creating expensive products. But in the long run US will reap the benefits if it signs the environmental agreement, as we have only one earth.
553	The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, is very clear that if one uses another person's computer service (in this case, someone's broadband connection) without permission, he has committed an offence. I am unsure of the Act's legislation history but the law was around since 1993. From your post, I would assume that your friends made use of the other party's router fairly recently. As such, if they are caught, they can be prosecuted. Arguing that the router is unsecured and/or does not have a unique SSID is futile; it is common sense that the router has to belong to somebody and if you are not in a free wireless zone e.g. McDonald's, then one should know that any access would probably be going through a privately owned network.
554	nuitsen I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths....what is the difference? s_s2 You do not see all the people (muslims) who are not suicide bombers protesting about the suicide bombers when Islam, so we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs...they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I don't see anybody protesting about that. I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole. Melliare?
555	Being in the police academy is very intense and can even be quite stressful. Were you supportive when he was there? Maybe I'm missing part of the story. You should be happy that he was bettering himself and furthering his career. I'd say if that was the only issue that caused your break-up, then yes, get back with him.
556	Depends on your state...Here in Nebraska Legal Majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that support is necessary through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a swift kick in the pants!
557	US doesnt' want to steal iraq's oil. it needs to control the world trade in oil. basially require all oil-producing countries to market their oil in dollars, effectively making american paper money redeemable in oil. compliant arab regimes also re-invest hundreds of billions of dollars of oil profits in the united states. if they're allowed to start selling oil in Euros they will invest their profits somewhere else and the US economy will suffer tremendously that's why bush went to war with all these countries. to maintain america's control over the oil trade.
558	I don't think that it should be a Gov't choice...It should be the owner of the property choice....I have yet to be somewhere where smoke bothered me because most places are non smoking...bars here in Ohio aren't most anyway...and that doesn't bother me at all...maybe the next day after smelling my clothes and hair but my breath probably stinks just as bad after a night of drinks. This is just a way of people controlling and getting money...one of the issues on the ballot if you read closely says money for the "clean air fund"...if they band smoking why would you need a clean air fund...and what on earth are you going to do with that money? I prefer my money to go to my child's college fund...but If this passes I won't have a choice will I?
559	If you are with your children, supervising them, then you wouldn't need a registry to do it for you. It is your responsibility as a parent to supervise your children at all times. If you will look at the crimes against children, they are children that were not being supervised by a parent. Also, 90 to 95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and the registries do nothing but provide a false sense of security.
560	In the state of Georgia as of 2006, a child of 17 years of can not move out of parents home without permission unless another guardian is appointed or you are an adult. Contact your local juvenile office if in doubt. The only reason the law enforcement does not enforce this law is because it would cost millions of dollars to enforce and most police officers are not up to date on juvy laws. Another few months will not hurt if your truly in love and you can finish school to make a brighter future for the two of you. Then just maybe Mom will be more for the relationship. Good Luck!!!! Already been there!!!!
561	The first answerer should be correct. I don't know Louisiana law, but I've never heard of a state putting something like that into law. Instead, it is a common courtesy that employers and employees typically offer two weeks notice before terminating. If you want to maintain a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference from them later, it's advisable to give two-weeks notice, but I'd be shocked to hear that it is required.
562	You seem to be looking for something to be discriminated against. If you miss your payments, whether white, black, purple or green, they have the right to discontinue their services to you. Sounds as though they gave you at least a couple of breaks and YOU chose to not do what is right and that is pay your bills on time. And yes I have the right to say this as I am Native American and proud of it and I don't feel discriminated against because I pay my bills on time if not early!!
563	the sheriffs department do not have sales they are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesman. Thry are bluffing you ( harrasement), they are laws on this. when a deby get dues to expire collection agencies get real aggressive on collection. The only thing a sherrifs department can do is allow a party to collect cars.. ect.. ( not sure about furniture ), or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
564	No one objects when those who COMMIT crimes are extradited...justice should be served even if criminals flee. However, we all know that accusations are made against innocent people, and that not all legal systems are the same in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them who face trial elsewhere are going to want to be pretty well convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.
565	Because someone didn't think they were stupid or senseless. And some of the laws we have now actually may not have been stupid when they were passed (for example a law forbidding to have meat, during periods when cows were seriously ill, and there was no other means to warn the people about the dangers of eating that meat). What is stupid is to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful. The one you mention (about singing in the bath) seems to have some kind of moral background. It seems stupid to us now, and it probably was stupid by the time it was passed, too. But it responded to the moral standards of that time.
566	It wasn't just the jews, hun. The nazis weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin. They were doing what they deemed right. "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions". They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category. They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race. They weren't exactly hating the people. They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions. We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no feelings, and no right to live happily. That's what the nazis did to various people groups. Stalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly, and enforced a "Harvest of Despair". You should watch the documentary below:
567	In my opinion, no. How would that effect the child is the first concern. When the child is small wouldn't be the issue, but as he/she entered school it would most defiantly get ridiculed by the other kids and have emotional stress/problems from this. This would really confuse the kid! I don't care what anyone says, a child needs a MOTHER and a FATHER. Not two women, and not two men.
568	The vast majority if the answers above make the same mistake that the question implies. It's not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. So, the "freedom of religion" right is not the issue. The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reaons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion. It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.
569	I think it's a good idea, because that way, everyone at the school is on the same playing field...at least appearance-wise. Those students who are less fortunate and don't have much money to buy clothes or have a lot of clothes don't have to worry about what their going to wear. I think it helps self-esteem and allows them to concentrate more on schoolwork.
570	No. Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.
571	If you are speaking of having the government interfere with what we as parents and responsible adults do to teach our children, then no.
572	Here's always been my thought: I'm Irish and don't complain that Notre Dame's nickname is the "Fighting Irish." I don't go around saying my heritage is being mocked or that I'm offended because "people think I like fighting." It's ridiculous. If any Native Americans are really concerned about this issue, why not look at poverty on the reservations, poor schooling, etc? There's so much more to worry about than school mascot names.
573	Answer is NO! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs. Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
574	american law. you don't need a peice of paper from anyone to prove to you YOU are married and want a lifetime commiment from the person you love the most, just tell her she's your wife and hold a ceremony somewhere the both of you find attractive and and share your thoughts on the future and express your love for one another. And don't forget to continue this thinking in every day for the rest of your life. Cause thats what it is all about.
575	Your client? Give me a break man...you are some crack pot conspiracy theorist...first there is no consistent question within your rant of improperly formed English (incomplete) sentences. Second, the racism charges in your "question" make it highly suspect. Honestly, I am glad that your "client" is not allowed in the US, because if he "hired" you, he should not be here.
576	If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action. The defense of temporary insanity is used in criminal proceedings. It generally would not apply to a civil proceeding. However, the defense of temporary insanity is (contrary to what you see on television and the movies) extremely rare. Some states do not allow it at all. Others, just like the "permanent" insanity defense, restrict it considerably. Mental anguish is a tort. I think it unlikely under the circumstances that a jury would give her much for a mental anguish claim. The fact that its a marriage that is obviously in trouble, and he would be able to produce his own evidence, would problably not make the case a viable case, IMHO.
577	It's boring. Kind of scary. Shower time could get right out of hand. Seriously, it is a drag. Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke. There are lots of good looking loonies in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it. So each has it's pros and cons, but I would have to recommend psyche ward over jail. and jail over my last marriage.
578	There are literally tens of thousands of water companies in the US. They are generally regulated by various federal and state agencies. If they comply with those regulations, there is no basis for a suit, class action or otherwise. In order to prevail, you would have to prove negligence. If you don't like tap water, drill your own well, install your own filtration system or buy bottled water. But, you will not prevail if you attempt to sue a water company unless you prove they are negligent.
579	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it -- buying merchandise you can't sell isn't good business practice. The same tactic has also been used against private citizens; activists would wait near big public events where they know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
580	The adverserial legal system is governed by rules of conduct and engagement imposed on both parties. In that sense it is ethical as it provides a structure for "fair play". However, a lawyer's job is to win a case hor his/her client. Taking advantage of loopholes in the law is one way to beat the otherside. In some cases, this may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process that we have provides the best way to redress a wrong since a party that feels its claim was not handled well/fairly within the scope of the law, can in some cases seek further action through the appelate courts. This is as good as it gets folks! The alternative would be Hamurarbbi's Sheria/Law, where justice is meted out in the form of chopping off body parts.
581	Firstly does your bf own the company or is he a worker? Secondly unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your bf has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man is he really an illegal allien? Then INS could come in and send him back. You know unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecing the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group. Unions are not all demons nor is management always the enemy however if that's how management and union posture themselves then there won't be any kind of labour peace.
582	Certainly, you can be very clever and have terrible grades, but at the same time it is not smart to do poorly in school, thus limiting your opportunity. I almost get angry when I hear someone say this. Granted this is a blanket statement, and doesn't include outside circumstance such as extreme poverty or a disease, but I feel that 90% of the time laziness is to blame. I've heard the "I know stupid people with good grades" argument and I don't understand that. Even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge Please change my view!
583	I've slowly been losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd. There's this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it (because you can't easily leap from something existing to something being moral without something being taken as axiomatic) and yet we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material? All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good (and we therefore must do X), and I can't seem to find any reason to believe that I should make that jump. *Why* should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it? *Why* should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning next to one without the latter seems far simpler with less baggage. CMV please.
584	1) A Home No one should be homeless in this world. Everyone deserves to have a place to call home, no one should be living on the street. 2) Food Everyone needs food to be able to live. No reason why people should starve. 3) Healthcare EVERYONE should receive equal healthcare regardless of their insurance and money situation. No one should be able to buy better healthcare. 4) Education Everyone should be entitled to getting some sort of education. I'm not saying put everyone into college, I'm just saying that if someone wants to better themselves with education, be it getting a basic high school education, a college degree, or some sort of trade, it should be available. This is where it gets unpopular. The government should pay for it.
585	I use to be able to watch that show with my family but it has become nothing but cheap sex jokes and I'm embarrassed to watch it with them any more. The questions are posed in such a way to elicit a 'dirty' response from the contestants. And when they do answer accordingly, Steve makes a shocked face to the camera as if that reply was so unbelievable. Every. Fucking. Time. I've noticed he has been getting lots of love on Reddit lately and I am surprised by this. Steve Harvey has taken the family out of family feud.
586	I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat them any differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I'm not a'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]
587	After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs. Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months. I am not saying that they are pointless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but as a source for up-to-date, interesting and well researched information, there are enough specialist sources for a deeper critique or explanation to current affairs, and Twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that is particularly salient. I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone, I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers, CMV?
588	After finishing Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed how much of a slap in the face to the servers. They rate their performance on how big or small their tips are. Be brutal, kind, or what you want. Just be logical.
589	I really see no benefits in government recognition of marriages. First, the benefits: no more fights about what marriage is. If you want to get married by your church - you still can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony - you can. Government does not care. Instant equality. Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency. Now to address some anticipated counter points: The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers. As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions? Sounds pretty unfair to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage. CMV.
590	People always talk about how unfair it is to discriminate against people, but I see tons of discrimination and hatred against the rich (especially on reddit). I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination. America is always talked about as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal can it be if it charges certain people more for being more productive?!?! Additional taxes and discrimination on the productive also serve the effect of discouraging this behavior (or encouraging it to happen elsewhere where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects), and our subsidy system for poor people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the ranks of the poor by millions.
591	Every time I see the news, whether it be CNN, Fox, or BBC, I see in the headlines "ISRAEL BOMBS GAZA; WONT STOP DESPITE KILLING CIVILIANS." I see the number of casualties to both sides and things just don't add up. I think it is possible that the Palestinians are taking up military strongholds in public compounds such as schools and hospitals, taking hostages (which could help account for the number of civilian casualties), and minimizing their military casualties by allowing the Israelis to destroy these compounds while under the impression that there are more soldiers there. What the world sees is the Israelis bombing the shit out of a bunch of helpless civilians, resulting in genocide. The end result is propaganda against a UN affiliated nation that is "mercilessly committing genocide against a smaller, helpless nation" despite all of the tension between these two nations that led up to this.
592	The smaller the body politic, the more the people are in control. The best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly China is governed with 1,351 million. I say the reason is that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent states, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense deals the way Europe is.
593	There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913 and, since then, people with moustaches haven't been seen as trustworthy thanks to people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Linin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and many more.
594	I know this is a touchy subject and most people will go with the capital punishment law, however I currently believe that we let these guys off too easy and they will think it's okay to do again and again Honesty if some jerk did this to your child and caught them what would you do? I'm only 23 and this subject angers me greatly I chose the age of 30 because I believe the age gap between 30 and 17 (or younger) is too big I feel like this should be only done for sexual crimes because I don't think anybody could possibly get turned on by murder I could be wrong though. I belive castration would be a suitable punnishment because you wouldn't really be able to rape a minor with out a penis.
595	Being horny is a sin. Wanking is a sin. Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin. Raping is a sin. If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are?
596	I've been looking into this economic doctrine for a while, and I just don't see how in 2014 you can still defend these principles as being either ethical or particularly effective. I understand that is was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 1960s ended. However, I feel as though there is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create multinational monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, creates serious economic inequality, erodes social good, and continues to perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy have influence. I'm genuinely curious if there are any real benefits to this kind of policy? or does it simply concentrate wealth?
597	I already thought it was very likely in the near term and even long term George W Bush was going to go down as the worst president in history, but now after we are seeing Iraq unravel, I'm sure of it. Lets review all of his failures: 1. Asleep at the wheel/ignoring all the warnings for 9/11 2. Completely false/made up pretext for the war in Iraq (WMDs), completely destabilizing the region (as we are seeing now) for decades. 3. After starting two wars in the middle east, engaged in doomed attempt at nation building/bringing democracy in order to enrich the military industrial complex and oil buddies. 4. Asleep at the wheel during the housing/finance bust, presiding over the worst recession since the great depression. 5. Cut taxes for the rich bringing us the biggest deficit and debt in history, resulting in MASSIVE spending cuts on social services during the great recession.
598	The schools are teaching kids learned helplessness and it only causes the true victims of the school to suffer at the hands of administration. The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda to keep kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings and is a key reason why there are more school shootings. When you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force. That is what the school system and laws in place do.
599	In the island of Ireland there is football; where you kick the ball with your feet and is seen all over the world e.g. FIFA World Cup but there is also Gaelic football. In America there is soccer and football [NFL]. I believe football in America is called football despite being egg shaped is because it is the associated sport of that name in that country, while soccer is the foreign sport.
600	I finally got to mid career level management as a woman in my 30s. I am now in a long-distance relationship where there is a pressure to move to where my significant other is living and working. We are both in inflexible corporate jobs. I believe although I am pass 30 years old and I do love him, I cannot sacrifice my career anymore for a big move. I dont speak the language he speaks (although I am learning it, I speak it in an elementary level). CMV. What beliefs do you hold that can make me move to be with someone I love but which will make me throw away everything in my home country? What else should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?
601	Powermat is being installed in 100,000 locations around the United States. If the next iPhone has a built in PMA component, then Qi will lose the war. Apple users are often Starbucks and Teavana regulars, so it will be convenient for them. PMA will be installed everywhere for the 50% of smartphone users in the U.S. who own an iPhone and Qi will die. CMV To be clear, I don't want this to happen. I support Qi and I don't like the data transmission (pushed ads) that PMA can do. So I want someone to give me hope for Qi. Please. Thank you.
602	Basically, I think doing away with offsides in soccer would make the game much more exciting. If the teams were both forced to spread across the entire field, everyone has more space, which allows for much more passing, shooting, and generally exciting offensives. This would also allow for games to be much higher scoring, which in my opinion is the most frustrating thing in any sport. Watching an entire 90 minutes only for neither team to win would almost be ended, or at least greatly reduced.
603	Let me start by saying I was really into the whole UFO topic for several years. After extensively following pretty much every new UFO sighting or alien conspiracy I could find I gradually went from being a firm believer to feeling like it's very likely that all alien/ UFO accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony. So many of the most credible seeming sightings end up being debunked as hoaxes. Similarly, so many credible sources of eye-witness testimony, such as the various military personnel in the disclosure project, end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money and or simply lying about their expertise such as Bob Lazar (claimed to work at Area 51). I would love for it to be true that aliens have been visiting earth and its all a big coverup but I can't think of a single credible example that hasn't been thoroughly discredited. CMV.
604	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike". It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to 'act like a lady'). And god forbid that men have some values that women are'supposed' to have. Why not have a gender neutral phrase? "Be a better person"?
605	The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment and specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God is the least morally defensible concept I can imagine. All of the worst dictators combined have nothing on the amount of suffering this world-view, if true causes. We are talking about a scale of billions being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions. Nothing all of humanity combined has done can ever come to the scale of this.
606	I'll admit it. I like Daisy. I know, I know, her voice is annoying, sure. That's your opinion. However, Super Mario Land was the first Mario game I ever beat, and so I have an affinity for her. Beyond that, though, it just makes sense to reuse her at least once. She's a familiar face to anyone who's ever played Mario Kart since the Gamecube. Moreover, now that Nintendo has a habit of sending Mario to places outside of the Mushroom Kingdom, a la Galaxy or 3D World, it would make perfect sense to bring him back to Sarassaland. It lets Peach be a playable character, it justifies her continued presence in spinoffs, and it could make the Mario universe more cohesive.
607	All my life I've been fascinated by economics and money. I recall spending a lot of time thinking about what qualities a "perfect" money would have, as I see many flaws with the current "candidates" e.g. gold/dollars/euros/etc. In particular, I see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use. As a consequence of this, I belief market forces will push direct more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior monies in the market place) until Bitcoin consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency. I have done a lot of FMA (failure mode analysis) on this, and I feel very confident in the conclusion that this is inevitable. I've invested my life's savings in Bitcoin. Change my mind?
608	I believe that Bill Nye is a much more prominent figure among the younger generation and has the all the skills and knowledge required to create a truly amazing experience while watching the Cosmos series. I am not saying that Neil deGrasse Tyson did a bad job but I simply believe that it would have been more fitting and symbolic to have Bill Nye who has been fighting so long for knowledge to be heard as the narrator and tour guide of the Cosmos series which will inspire the next generation of thinkers.
609	I don't want this to come across as arrogant, but I am studying at university and get good grades. I have achieved mostly First Class grades this semester while my friends get 2:1s and 2:2s. There is an expectation that I achieve Firsts, and therefore when I do score highly on work I receive replies such as "of course" or "is that it?" jokingly from my peers. I am not trying to be arrogant, but I can't talk about this with any one of the guys on the course. They feel like I should be 'grateful' for my grades, despite the fact I put substantially more planning and writing time into the work I submit. In the past I have usually had a peer to compete with, but I am lacking that and I feel it puts pressure on me to just keep at the top.
610	Just completed a marathon of the series, and for my money, the first three were just more enjoyable. The story was quite rich; the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the role of the Jedi... Each arc wasn't just a progression of linear events building up to Episode IV. There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett. Next to the new ones, the old episodes seem slow, linear a little dumb. I also accept that much of what we accept now as standard fare for sci-fi is off the back of Star Wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes (in episodic order) were more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three.
611	METAL IS EVIL. Firstly, the symbolism it contains can be interpreted as evil even by a 5th grader! If this dark genre is continued to prosper, our youth will be affected negatively! Next, the lifestyles of it's artists. Most of them live very sinful and evil lifestyles. Is it because of the genre? I believe so.
612	Yes, the president should be impeached. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are not aware of the war crimes and crimes against humanity that George W. Bush, becuase of multiple instances of "misinformation" that was given, or possibly not as a result of, we must all agree that George W. Bush is one that should be impeached. Remember this: while Bush is not currently the worst, he is among the worst, and we must find someone more competent with the politics and world affairs of the United States of America that will bring us into this time of need for leadership, albeit only for two years.
613	1) Gold standard: Gold is inflexible and too slow in growth. It will not catch up to our economy. Also, banks will fail, destroying our economy. 2) No IRS: government loses income, stopping our ability to carry out fiscal policy and adjust ourselves out of recessions and overheat, annihilating the moderator system of our economy. 3) Quit UN: I have no idea why he wants to do this. Something with the debt. But the UN membership fee won't cause a big debt. 4) Quit Japan: There is a reason the last military practice for NKR was to shoot a missile over Japan. I wonder what they were practicing for.
614	People will always keep their opinions about religion, no matter what. Because, they were raised that way. Religious person says "God is here. I don't know how or why, but he is here and we must obey." Atheist says "God is impossible. It defys science. It's a bizarre thought with no evidence." And we are back to square one...
615	What practical application is there in knowing whether or not there was life on Mars? Other than curiosity, what could we hope to gain when the world is suffering being torn apart by war, starving, job loss on the rise? Which is not to say I am not curious, that I am not fascinated when I get to watch a good program about space, I am. But we need to focus our resources on fixing what is wrong here on Earth before we go chasing the curios of the galaxy.
616	no the world will not end NASA keeps looking and we won't get hit for i thimk it was 3,000 years the funny thing is made a bet with my friend if the world doesn't end in 2012 i get $5 if he does he gets $5 he said "if we see the asteroids i have to pay up" i can't wait for those $5 LOL
617	Yes, I do believe so. Within in reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of discipline has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.
618	my friend is, in my opinion, being foolish. she is gonna move to texas to a place where she will be in the minority. 13% of the entire town is white. mostly gang territory. not far from the mexican border. leaving everything behind, includeing family and friends. most people tell her to stay. What do you think?
619	Tj is smarter than Sheldon because he had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10. He skipped from grade 4 to grade 10, he had no trouble doing the work and also taught the grade 10 class and got into arguments with teachers and he was always right. TJ was able to hack into numerous things. He was even on a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with grown adults that were very smart maybe as smart a Sheldon.
620	As tempting as the "week debate" pun is (and it is!).... Isn't it bad enough that the year supposedly starts in the middle of winter, so that each year gets TWO winters? Why would we want to split up our weekend so that it's only one day long on each end? A work-week is five days, then two days of play; lather, rinse, and repeat. Or take the "week" off and go skiing, but that's neither here nor there. I prefer calendars that start with Sunday 'cause it's prettier (symmetry!), but window-dressing aside, the week starts on Monday.
621	From the moment I walked in, there was already something wrong with my experience. No one greeted us, so me and my friends (group of 5) decided to find a seat on our own. Once I sat down the cook told us they could not serve us because they had no plates. Once we didn't leave after she stated that, she proceeded to make a remark to convince us to leave. After she said that, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I don't know why this place is 24 hours if they're not able to function. We went while there was one other customer there! This place was not even busy, if it was busy I would understand why they had no plates. But if they had one other customer in the building, I don't understand why they had no plates. Horrible experience and would never go again.
622	Cannot believe didnot write a review for this place Located inside the Planet Hollywood and its open 24 hours. Great place to go to when you have the munchies while your Recommendations
623	This place's idea about individual portions is pretty unique. There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets. Service was nice, although it became a bit of a "Where's Waldo" when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. New York Steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner, as we came during brunch!
624	Raising Cane's is a good choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is good. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.
625	I can't sing new way's praises enough. I live a hop, skip and a jump away from this gem and checked it out for the first time after some Arsenal workers recommended it on a night they didn't have a food truck. The owner is super friendly, makes everything from scratch and gives you substantial portions at an extremely low price. The place is never too crowded so he is always able to whip up your delicious meal in no time whilst you window gaze at the busy strip of Penn Avenue outside. The Tuscan chicken sandwich was awesome as well as the hot italian sausage sandwich when it is on special. You really can't go wrong with anything you get there, though. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!
626	We've gone 2x now and won't be going back again. The first time, it was decent but the steaks were way overcooked. We decided we'd give them another try and order our steaks rare. The second time, it was a 20 min wait to be seated, another 15 for the food, and when we got it, the steaks were way overcooked again, even though we ordered it rare. The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. Then we go up front to pay, it takes another 7 mins for someone to come ring us up. She asks how it was and we told her it was awful, she said "sorry, $34.24" we should've just walked out, I wouldn't have felt guilty, it was disgusting.
627	Pizza was decent. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. You have to hit no for the tip and sign. I would think that for to go orders would not ask for a tip at all. They did not have any menu's you had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. Said pizza would take about 9 minutes and ended up being 28 minutes. This is a new place and their sanitation score was a 97.5.
628	Students should be allowed to express them selves.. and with the uniform.. well they are all the same... thats not fun.
629	i thik thier bad because i think ushould be free with out nobody telling u wat to do
630	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
631	Students have the right way to feel and express their opinions but it's wrong it's the learning which makes us smart
632	When you're out of college or High School or whatever, like in an office, you have to choose your own clothing.
633	I find that whatever works for a person individually, is good. How would I be able to say one thing is better than another, when it doesn't work on someone else's computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the 7 update. ;D
634	Since when is Firefox an Apple fad? There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one. If you are "original and free minded" then why do you use the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else does "original"?
635	I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was having an affair with.
636	Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.
637	books are better than TV because TV can make you blind. your eyes can also hurt alot if you watch to much.
638	books are better than TV because most of the TV kids watch add influences to them which are not good and most parents don't care what there children watch and I think books are better because you learn more from books.
639	i m student of class 11.I have to take part in dbt.that' s why asked you,plz.give me more datas.i will be highly obliged to you
640	The increasing population means less land, and less land means a big crowd on every place. India is able to win gold medal of corrosion, terrorism, illeteracy, violence, etc.
641	I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.
642	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a bad father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers are. You still have other people to look up to even though your dad is not around. I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.
643	I thinks its better if you be a fatherless than a bad father because your bad father would give you bad influence. Maybe you might follow your father as he is. But if your a fatherless is gonna be ok but not good either because you might not like being a fatherless. As long as you are a bad father or fatherless so they can encourage you to success in life and also help you correct your msitake that you had made.
644	I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a bad father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to be around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.
645	As a young boy you grow hoping and that you have a father figure in there life to be there when he is needed. The last thing they need is someone who lives with them and doesn't do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life. As a young man it is important that you have someone in your life to support you and push you to be successful in life.
646	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it will be an orderly, elegant, rational and modern and he worked towards it. But while he was gone, Farquhar developed Singapore poorly causing Raffles to feel dissappointed.
647	Although Farquhar was said to be the one who stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, the strategizing, and was the one to select Singapore as another British base, giving early Singaporean support of the British.
648	Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, and not William Farquhar. I agree that Farquhar was the one that remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen, also, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's Development, so he should be considered a founder.
649	Schooling Raffles established the Singapore Institution ( Now known as Raffles Institution ) which completed its construction in the year 1837.
650	Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was formed by Raffles to oversee the project.
651	Raffles found that Farquhar had done a poor job of raising the city of Singapore, he also introduced opium selling into Singapore in order to raise more money to build Singapore.
652	IF YOU go live in that olden time conditions in just one month in those conditions it would be a surprise if you did not catch a disease every single day.hospitals were one thing raffles built and that would have saved so many people in those times because the living there was conditions were bad. another reason he has helped on the development
653	is it wrong? yes. unhealthy? yes. addictive? yes. but so is smoking ciggarettes. just because its wrong doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.
654	If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. If a man and a woman or a woman and a man or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.
655	k, I believe that 'God' created and then 'tweaked' via evolution? we all find out within 100 years anyways....
656	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument I'm very familiar with it I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process Both moth colors have always been there Its just a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution- That's a diet plan
657	Evolution is as unlikely as a tornado going through a junkyard and putting together a 747 Airplane.
658	I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera which takes much less time to start. Plug-ins I frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perform well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.
659	(I am writing this through Firefox) Emotions aside, Firefox has no ActiveX support. It makes it unusable for at least the new Windows VirtualEarth.
660	Chorme is the fastest and the safest plus its also open source like firefox
661	Even though Raffles did all the planning, Farquhar did make some plans of his own, too, since Raffles had to leave for Bencoolen. This meant that Farquhar had to plan on his own, too.
662	Farquhar was the one that played the role of a'mother' to Singapore. He contributed more to Singapore than Raffles supporting the fact that he was the founder of Singapore.
663	I am going to take the Obama approach to this Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it
664	If a woman is raped and left with the child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the decision to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.
665	I am personally against abortion, but I believe in the right of choice. What matters to a pregnant mother is not what I or most people think about it. She must decide what to do with her child.
666	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. However, elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
667	How can that be? How were you brought up? Did you go to church? Sunday school? Pray before meals? Pray at school? Pray at night? I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. And God. It didn't make sense. So I stopped assuming God was real, and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (thankfully my public school system stopped that practice). So please tell me where I have been lied to.
668	There's no concrete evidence that supports that god exists. Religion and the bible have too many contradictions and changes that I become less and less convinced in his existence... Evolution makes more sense to me. Animals adapt to their environment, and over huge amounts of time will evolve to be able to survive through different climates and situations.
669	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people your hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
670	Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become less petty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.
671	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else. i don't like hurting people. it would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else's well being before we think about our selves.
672	Student victimization is likely to be lowered and fights and gang activity are likely to be decreased, as there is less competition in regard to wearing the most fashionable clothing.
673	yes,of course. School uniform is important because it is a logos for our school. It reminds us that we are part of the school. Also, if we use the uniform, the teacher will give us a punishment and from that we can learn to be a discipline student. Additionally, if we go out from the school than the teacher will see we used the school uniform, so people will know that we are from that school. Thankyou.
674	It would be better to have a bad father than to not have a father at all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is bad it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is bad but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.
675	I think it's better to have a father than be fatherless because, growing up without a father can be hard for some kids. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong, but as long as you have a father no matter how bad he is, at least you have somebody their to support your decisions and encourage you.
676	I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the child's life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up with a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.
677	Bottled water is not strictly regulated while tap water is, so you have no idea what you are drinking when you use bottled water.
678	Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.
679	Over 1.5 million barrels of oil were used to make the plastic bottles consumed in the US last year, and that does not include the petroleum used to transport them. That's enough oil to power 100,000 automobiles for a year.
680	In New York City alone, the transportation of bottled water from western Europe released an estimated 3,800 tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere. In California, 18 million gallons of bottled water were shipped in from Fiji in 2006, producing about 2,500 tons of global warming pollution.
681	If you don't save the bottled water for an emergency you are not thinking about later you are thinking about now. You are drinking bottled water when you don't even need to.
682	nowadays no one can liv wdout t.v... its common to watch t.v to all... so.. t.v ix beter than bookxx... everybody vote for t.v....
683	TV is important for communication, because this is to cross the charector limit.
684	Because it is a source of entertainment also its help people that cant read.
685	As long as people recycle the environment, the water bottles are thrown and poluted. Its not the water companies fault.
686	The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court.
687	Gay people are making a terrible mistake because I think they are living the life right now with not having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.
688	Do we have the potential? Yes. The only competition we have is China who has done a much better job in the long run. But then again the way India runs.. it always makes order out of chaos.
689	Why do you think we can't stand that question? Also you forgot all the other choices. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism one and on.
690	Christianity: belief in rape, genocide, hell fire, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc Atheism: the rejection of these claims based on logic, observation, and common sense
691	People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this, whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly, I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
692	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was fortunate to encounter a church full of people who were actually kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still wholly believes in the beliefs and teachings of the Christians, only now I see it like this: I believe in God, not religion.
693	I am a Christian for I believe there is a just God who will do ultimate justice for the good and bad deeds done here on earth.
694	i'm not a Christianity but if your a Christianity, you really can't argue with them at all unless your argument is base on on the same subject. kinda of like street fighting and UFC. different platform.
695	If God doesn't exist, how come there are loads of predictions, sent by God, written thousands of years before Jesus saying exactly what happened to Jesus?
696	It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
697	honestly who cares - if people want to be together so be it. it isn't like marriage is some high holy thing - we sell it on tv, in drive throughs, etc. and that is fake love. if people really want to be together then who are you to tell them no? If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend. plus what will you do when your kids are gay?
698	Three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups. Especially against gay marriage. They are extremely biased. I did not even have to go to the sites to know that. Those three are #2,#3, and #5 on your list. #2 is a polling company, if I recall and 'try' to write intelligently, but don't have research behind their writings. #1 has no real barring on the argument at hand.
699	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country.
700	There is an argument of people saying is gay marriage acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love. Because how come we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman as gay sexuality. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like!!
701	I think that personal pursuit is better because i think that helping yourself before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do everything comes back to you even if your helping others, because you dont want your life to be out of whack helping others.
702	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything to help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
703	You don't say anything about your homelife. You have to have a very good reason for it. If you could get a job within walking distance, I think they consider that reasonable. I put up with a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home.... and I still recommend staying at home as long as you can. If it is your homelife that is the problem, get Social Services involved.
704	Since he knew about it, did not petition the court at that time, let alot of time go past, the court will view this most likely as allowing it. But he will have to petition the court to find her in contempt, and order her to return to the state. alot better chance had it done it prior to her moving, or as soon as she moved.
705	The deal is: "Freedom of speech goes both ways" People not only have a right to say pretty much what they want, other people have a right to object, argue & even ask for an apology. A liberal says something, a conservative objects & the conservative is bashed for 'violating a person's freedom of speech.' A conservative says something, a liberal objects, and conservatives either let it drop there or defend the original statement on its merit. So who is really against freedom of speech; The conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement?
706	Americans as a whole do not think this way. There is much controversy in our country about this issue. It is currently legal in most (I believe) states to have an abortion, but conservative religious groups are always trying to change the law. Obviously, I am pro-women's rights (not pro-abortion and not pro-life, but believe that since it's the woman's responsibility it ultimately needs to be her choice.)
707	Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it and you'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the USA's. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it of course. On the other hand, its immoral for a man to take another's life no matter what the situation since you are assuming a position of superiority when you do so and every man on the earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice.
708	The dismissal in fact leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt. "Without prjeudice" means that the case was not adjudicated and no resoltuion has been made. However, at this point you have grounds for a counter-action if they continue to pursue this claim, or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies. You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected. In this manner you protect your intersts - and, if the company is foolish enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
709	To answer your question and to refute the person who compared capital punishment to abortion: The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent. Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening. But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money? If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live? Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row. And concerning abortion...unborn babies have not committed crimes.
710	I believe that you have to put a fence around any pool in Ohio. Lets put it this way- if you dont put a fence around your pool, and a child sneaks in and drowns- you would be completely liable, and would likely lose your house, your car, and have your wages garnished for years while you worked to pay off the liability lawsuit. To me, the risk isnt worth the reward, I would install it no matter what the law is (but yes, I think every pool in Ohio requires one). Also, if you dont have a fence around it, you might have problems with your homeowners insurance over the liability issue as well.
711	This is a great question! I actually just learned all about discrimination in the workplace, and covered this. It's funny, because the law states that you cannot discriminate due to sex, color, or age. However, white men are the only group that is not covered in a protected class. So, technically, yes it is illegal to exclude them, but they are not protected! Seems kinda funny, but how often in America do they need protection...?
712	Technically IC Systems is liable, but you'd probably have to go to small claims court to force them to pay. My advice to you is to change your bank account number right away so they can't dip into it any time they like. (This is the only dependable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you have given your permission for the withdrawal.) Then set up other payment arrangements with them. While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you. Put that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left. Then stop paying. If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
713	We already have this, it is called the Social Security Card. Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information of a given social security number. However, our government has made it so difficult to do this that most employers will not take the time. When you are hired for a job, you are supposed to provide I-9 documentation. You can use a passport, or state issued id & social security card (not just number), or birth certificate & ss card, etc. There are already laws and fines in place regarding improperly documenting your workers. The problem is our elected officials would rather waste our money & time by presenting completely new regulations (justifying their jobs) instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have. Politicians are becoming better and better at doing nothing but creating redundent worthless laws. And we keep re-electing them. So I would NOT vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and waste of the American taxpayers' monies.
714	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation. That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines. And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
715	Not at all. That's when we need those freedoms the most. We need to be able to say that "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prision. I may not agree with someone else's opinions. But I'll fight to the death, to make sure they can state those opinions.
716	how do you think we got our freedom by standing back. in the public eyes iraq does not deserve freedom like ours. we need keep fighting the terrorist for the people OF THE WORLD from the terrorist who rule it. and we are not dictators we are freedom fighters who fight for FREEDOM, JUSTICE AND LIBERTY. unfortunately people lost sight of it and voted wrong yesterday. and morally we are now also headed in the wrong direction. people need to be responible for their action and not blame it on science or the society. finally for the budget there goes the state and national level budget and economy and our taxes. people want things to be in place for a better country and community. but who do you think we pay for it in the long run. we do with our taxes, not with the so called federal and state money people think we have.
717	Law is an obligation of society to which a person has to abide. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught.. however, people tend to bend laws and break laws.. to which the penalty is not severe.. say, like speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. Any law would be right if it doesnt invade the realms of Human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify. However thats a very tiring and exhaustive process.
718	i totally agree with you for the same reasons. my animals suffer every year as they seem to go off weeks before now. the first big display i know of was a few weeks ago in the middle of October! what happened to November 5th! i cant sedate my animals because it goes on for weeks. they are terrified! even though the sale of fireworks is illegal to kids, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol. they are dangerous and just another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public. it should be illegal to sell them in shops. organised displays should be set for the one night only, so animal lovers can help their pets by sedation. you are so right on this subject x
719	Thanks for bringing up this important issue. Most of the things you mentioned have beneficial uses. The danger is if they are misused. I think the Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined. They are talking of retaining the prisoners in Cuba for the rest of their lives, without charges or benefit of legal defense. The only way to protect our rights is to participate in the process of government. I hope anyone who reads this is ready to defend liberty with their vote on the 7th.
720	If half the schools in the US thinks yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights, and the rights of others. I thought schools get taught the Constitution and Bill of Rights. At least I would expect thee civil war to be mentioned before 6th grade, the rest would follow. Freedom of speech, FREEDOM OF PRESS, freedom of religion, and so on. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not new great Brittan or some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. ( ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. No wonder why 1/2 the youth is lost and confused)
721	If we are speaking in the realm of ethics, you should be notified of any medications taken by the child... However, legally, if this juvenile center is treating your child for any sort of mental illness, they do not have to notify you if he/she is older than 12. I also believe that since the child is a ward of the state due to his/her incarceration, the state does not have to notify you of any new charges or pending charges....
722	I've never been a server or waitress but, I feel that regardless of how much in tips they make, they should get minimum wage. They work just as hard as anyone else. As for the tips, they have to earn them. Just think of a slow night and little or no tips...she walks away with what, 20 bucks for working 8 hours on her feet. I think there should be a change in this, everyone should get nothing less than minimum wage regardless of their occupation.
723	I agree with you. If a person wants to say the Pledge before a meeting (game, class, etc.) then they should be allowed to do so. No one is forcing others to join in and pledge -- they are perfectly within their rights to abstain. It really p*sses me off when people try to claim that just "hearing" the pledge violates their rights. Well, what about my right to assert myself and my allegiance to my country?? I would think that would trump anything else.
724	No!! Firstly, because this essentially puts a price on human life and dignity. Life can be given, it should not be sold. Second, because it's usually a short term decision, that can be dearly regretted if you live long enough. You will of course sell only organs you can live without, a kidney or an eye... but what if, later in life, your remaining one fails, and you don't have the money to replace it? You're in the doo doo, possibly dead if it was a kidney.
725	I don't think so. I'm sure he's not the first student to think of this. It's a given. You're taking a test to show what you have learned. Obviously he's learned nothing! That would be like getting surgery on your heart and after the doctor says, "oh you wanted it done correctly? Well, you didn't say that". Tell him to use the energy he's scheming with to STUDY!
726	If daughter was 19, and competent at the time, then all records are hers, nobody elses. However, depending on how much time has passed the document holders could be charged with theft. If years have passed, and the daughter hasn't made previous attempts to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders documents. You need a lawyer involved.
727	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens.
728	The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process. The person asking the questions has his bias; a person who wrote the question has her bias; a person who is answering the question has a bias as well. The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set (the specific group of people to whom the poll is given) is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both. Sometimes small and/or homogeneous samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll.
729	When your time on earth is over, to the extent that people remember you fondly, and are changed for having known you, you have made a difference.
730	Yeah, it's biased. But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet subject search records of Americans over to Bush and Co. in the administration's guise of cracking down on porn? From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda. And it was dumb to pose that question. It is a crime to threaten the President and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way--especially by this president. But I've noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then are fine with it. I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
731	Have you been standing out in the free cheese line in the hot sun for too long? Hey, believe it or not, the rich people DO pay lots of other people's taxes for them! But it's the middle class that gets the short end of the stick. The rest of your ramblings sound rather socialist. Are you insinuating liberals are emulating socialists? I never, in a million years, would have thought THAT (pause for heavy sarcastic sigh).
732	This is one of the fundamental protections in a civilized society. We are now reduced to the level of a police state. I don't blame Bush for asking for this power; I blame a cowardly congress for granting it. That's one reason the nation rejected the GOP.
733	Do you mean "employee"? And what's "unfair dismissal"? In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all. Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn'tmean you have an action against them for firing you. However, there are restrictions. Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability). They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states. SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a "Contigency" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case. Contact your local bar association for a reference.
734	I heard that in Australia and US (I think, 2 countries that use ID cards anyway) there is a much higher rate of identity theft, because all someone would need to steal your identity is one card instead of having to go through loads of bills etc. to get all your details. I think it's a stupid idea and you'll probably end up having to have an ID card to prove who you are in order to get an ID card, or you'll need a passport, driving licence or some other such thing that not everybody has. Then again if they introduced them and someone stole the identity of someone like the prime minister and got all his money then they'd just see how silly an idea it was.
735	I like very much the way you started: ALL RISE! And there is no legal system which is perfect! Moreover, though, I do not trust "god" and this is due to the fact that god never talks to anyone, except the leaders (which gives me suspicions that the leaders claim they were told by god! - what do you think?) For example, whenever someone attacks another, in the last 16 centuries, they claim that god ordered them to do that! Last, but not without importance was the Bush claim for America's and her allies to Iraq!
736	Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judged by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish.
737	i agree with you. unless maybe the person can't for a medical reason, etc. but other than that, yes. SHOW RESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY! our brave soldiers are willing to go fight for america and risk their lives and some people in here are to lazy to get of their ass to pledge allegiance to the flag. i think its wrong. i will proudly stand for my country and do everything i can to support it.
738	last time i checked he still has the right to a court appt attorney..until then if you can"t make bail or get a bondsmen then i guess he will have to tough it till his court date..if he hates it that bad then maybe he won't make the same mistake again when choosing a girl.
739	Scientifically, humans are born with the instincts to reproduce with women. So far there is no evidence that I know of that proves that there is a gene (or several genes for that matter) that determines your sexual orientation. Mainly, I believe that people convince themselves that they are gay and believe it so strongly that they believe that they have been gay since birth. I don't discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.
740	Although mergers of big companies are carefully analyzed before getting a green light, so as to not distort competition by creating a single company with too much power, the purchase of smaller companies by big companies is not considered problematic, even if the value of the small company is huge. For example the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook a huge amount of personal information, which is Facebook's main business model, putting it in a leading position to sell this data. However, not only has there not been any analysis of the merger, I also feel some right of our has been violated, the moment Facebook gained the right to do as it wishes with my data without my consent and without giving me an option to opt out and delete the data. Just because I trusted company A with my data does not give company B, the buyer, my trust.
741	I live near a large navy base and everyone in the community supports the military. It is to the point where it is viewed as more noble in my community to join the military after high school than to go to college, when in reality, most people enlisting from my school are those who didn't get into college. On the other hand, anyone who has the opinion that war is wrong and that a large military is bad, is viewed down upon in my community. This isn't just in my community, I see it on world news. The Military is idolized on television, political ads, and news programs. I don't believe that members of the Military are anything special and I think they shouldn't be treated as such.
742	I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine as well as a.40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun that holds 12 rounds. My view is that someone can take out just as many people with a hand gun as they would with an "assault rifle". IMO handguns would be more dangerous because they are easily concealable. AK-47's and AR-15's are considered assault rifles even though they can't shoot any faster than any other semi-automatic weapon (legally). Just because they look scary doesn't mean they are more dangerous. What say you?
743	Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured, then killed by other cars passing over it. My sister cried out emotionally watching this animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will at bit unpleasant is not something one should show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another Field. I am a wage earner, I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road. It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way.
744	Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical, easy way to transfer money from a checking account to another account. However, with today's technology (debit cards), the need for them has disappeared. Direct deposit is paperless removes the need for paper checks for employers to pay their employees. Outside of the workplace, the only people who seem to pay with paper checks are older people, who seem to not have a problem with paper checks and have no reason to adapt, even though it causes an inconvenience to people waiting in line behind them.
745	Men have been hit hardest by the recession, and have not bounced back. Lots of men remain unemployed, and men are going to college at lower numbers than ever. Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not. There exist lots of secure jobs (teaching and nursing are the most readily available and accessible examples) that are 90% female, both in the field and in college majors. Considering the higher male unemployment, I think anyone offering a female-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male-specific scholarship to a female-dominated field.

746	In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody who can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining? I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure their bodies can endure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
747	In both of these events a country lost territory which rightfully belonged to its people. In both cases, an authority felt the need of land-grabbing, one secured their military base, the other wanted their holy land back also secured their military presence. Both of these events caused and continue to cause ultimately unnecessary instability within Ukraine and Palestine. This naturally leads to deaths. Yet, because of superpowers involved it's common to make this an issue about taking sides with either the US or Russia, when the countries essentially did the same thing.
748	The actual leaders of bailed-out firms should be killed by lethal injection, not figureheads or sacrificial lambs. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who called the shots, even if they've since quit.
749	There are hundreds of states on the planet and all of them engage extensively in initiating aggression against the individuals they control. Sometimes state's violence is in response to violence initiated by individuals and then it can be justified. For example – imprisoning a murderer. A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates the violence. Yet most people do not see the aggression initiated by the state as problematic. For example we say "drafted" when we could say "slave soldier" or "drug confiscation" when we could say "theft of herbs". These euphemisms muddy the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations. One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence and it will be as incomprehensible to them as Spanish inquisition is to us.
750	Pretty much what it says in the title. I'll explain further by saying that I believe that government is a good thing, the consciousness of society when done right, and taxes are the natural cost of having a good government. While high taxes do not necessarily mean a good government, I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails. So what am I missing? Why is a good government a government that governs least, and thus needs less money? Who ever heard of a structures that does it's purpose best by doing it least. I don't understand it. Please help me understand it.
751	Its quite simple. Men who are wealthy and famous, nevermind if they are also younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They dont even need any game to get sex. Its too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV. Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. Its more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you. For this reason, i believe that women such as Tiger Woods ex-wife were being delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.
752	Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices their(the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker section of the skyrim story.
753	I believe the word they might be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture that is not just reserved for blacks. While again, the whole culture itself is not that bad, there are many parts that have stemmed from this culture that are themselves bad for society. For example, a great deal of sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through rap music and the culture behind it (though this is slowly changing). Another is the inherent disrespect that comes with the culture, and just overall rudeness. Just look at the hundreds of videos of vine of people just destroying others' property for laughs, or even the knockout videos or the glorification of those who suckerpunch. It's despicable.
754	Example: Christian A denies carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life in all discovered and undiscovered universes, as well as a whole lot of other crazy stuff. Christian B accepts that evolution is true, accepts that the whole concept of god as portrayed in the bible is archaic and incompatible with the 21st century, but still follows good christian values, believes in god as simply a 'higher being' and believes that they will be rewarded after death for being a good person. Christian A does not *deserve* to be taken seriously, they can still have their beliefs without denying whats scientifically proven, but they choose to be ignorant. Having a religion based on faith is fine, I personally have my own spiritual beliefs, but I dont see how you can not take the church of the flying spaghetti monster seriously if you take christian fundies seriously.
755	I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study's or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view.
756	We are all capable of the horrendous act that Hitler committed or fostered in his life. The right circumstances and societal influences could bring out the same in each of us.
757	Anything we consider art is based on the artist's ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion. Similarly, many of the things that we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art (e.g. fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner. Thus, I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self.
758	One cannot decide whether or not one sex is greater in intelligence than the other. It will all depend upon the individual.
759	However, creature comforts and political freedom are still such attractive features to non-Americans that we gain valuable brainpower from countries like India and China every day. There is no doubt that we have our own societal ills, but the US is still at the top of innovation, whereas China, India and even much of Europe can only replicate our inventions, follow in our research, and imitate our military strength.
760	Just look at our own bodies, we have residues of our ancestors, we shiver and get bimps like reptiles, our hair stands on its end when frightened and we all have tail bones. I am not an atheist, I believe in God. I just believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen, including that what was created would evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve. I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution and neither do a growing number of progressive believers of God of various denominations.
761	Oil has long outlived its use. There is enough plastic in existence that simply recycling what is unused could supply more plastic. All plastic is recyclable. Battery technology has existed for nearly 10 years now that can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge. That exceeds many gas-run vehicles on the road today. All production use oil damages the environment, causes numerous diseases, and is the primary cause of global warming. Oil spills kill hundreds of thousands of animals per year, as they continue to affect the area of the spill decades after it occurred. Oil is the primary interest of the US in the mid-east, and as such, it is the cause of numerous wars.
762	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people because for the most part animals are viewed as inferior which then justifies locking them up. F**k zoos.
763	I do not think such a thing should be enforced by law. In certain cases it's necessary to have privacy on the web. However, if you have nothing to hide...or are not reconnoitering sh*t, no need to hide your identity. Is it annoying when people, for instance, post shit online attacking others but hide their identity? To me it is.
764	As of now pride has much more talent than ufc. pride has fighters from all over the world, where ufc is limited mostly to north america. it's not a usa vs the world argument, just means there's a bigger talen pool to pick from. crocop & rampage have their reasons for coming over(who's to say pride didnt send them over to promote pride in the us), but still too many good fighters left in pride, ie. fedor.
765	Don't give me all that "They changed the way we make music" or "They were so deep" nonsense. I listen to rock and roll to rock and roll, not to ponder life's deeper meanings. When I listen to rock music, my standard of greatness is whether or not this song makes me want to turn my stereo up or not. I can't think of a single Beatles song that I can simply turn on and rock out to. The Who - hands down.
766	Human beings are not able to live without the help of machines. This is seen in the hospital, where respirators, kidney dialysis machines and defibrillator devices are used to keep people alive, save them when they are on the brink of death. Further more, hand phones, cars, mp3 players and the PSP that we see thousands of children, teens and adults playing as well clearly show us mankind's huge dependence on machines.
767	Not how I would want to earn my living. BUT, what right do I have to judge what some one else does with their life? I have enough trouble keeping track of ME. When I was younger I might have answered this question much differently. Life has a way of changing the way you look at it as you mature. I am only responsible for me and I will have to answer for whatever I have or haven't done. Anybody that doesn't think I'm right probably has a few more life experiences before them.
768	I would make the argument that people are basically good. That is not to say that all people are good all of the time, or even that all people are basically good. Clearly we have had some rotten eggs. But that does not mean we are essentially evil, selfish things. Easily misled, perhaps, but not inherently bad. On an individual level, people are capable of great caring and impressive acts of selflessness.
769	Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis in case he should become the big cheese after the November election. Okay, but keep in mind that he has admitted that the economy is not his strong suit, I let him slide on that too. What stops him from giving up just a few hours for one evening to be part of a debate that is very important to his election chances? Because of that I feel McCain is running scared which is hurting his chances, he's demonstrating that when it come to crunch time, he'll bail and look for something ele to do
770	Yes it is... There are several times "no" is the correct answer though; dictatorships have called themselves a republic (the example for nerds: the republic in star wars)... But in fact, are Republicans and Democrats the same? In both forms the people vote for the person/persons they want to "rule" them, the people choose those who agree with them, the only difference is the different countries' way to do it. For an example: Denmark uses the way where the people (18+) vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc. USA chooses 1 president....BUT STILL: The people CHOOSE, and that's where they combine and IS the same, it's the people who vote and choose "the chosen ones".
771	Why? Why go out of your way to take away some ones right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit for happiness. If the right to marriage gets taken away, those people who lost the right might not be truly happy. All I have to ask is, if the gay community can get their rights taken away, then, Whos Next?
772	Although it is not technically correct (Web 2.0 is not a new technical iteration of the WWW), the mass adoption of a technology requires two important things: 1) A technology that works and 2) A hook that the audience and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will be able to relate to, mass marketers can use it etc etc. I know its a flimsy argument and it will irritate a lot of people, including me, if it happens BUT it's a name that works better than Semantic Web - SW is not the kind of name you see on cereal boxes.
773	I play guitar and don't feel like I suck. I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. Oh yeah... AND I LOVE GUITAR HERO! It actually helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed.
774	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level. Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
775	victor frankl was a psychiatrist's and during world war 2 a prisoner in a concentrations field he say that in such a terrible condition he feels free because he can choose to go insane or keep the calm, not only he feels free, he was free because freedom is choice and he choose people can say that freedom is the capacity to do what ever you want bud condition is a characteristic of freedom, every choose have consequence, i can choose if tomorrow i steal a bank of course the i a m going to jail ( if they cath me XD ) and if you choose a path you should accept the consequence
776	I actually think GRAW on the 360 is the best military multi player game on the system. The graphics are actually superb and obviously more realistic (being based in a much more realistic future with less technological assumptions made). The game play is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing feild to noobies alongside more experienced players. The interface has been deisgned with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc. And GOW was simply over hyped and doesn't present the same replay value to me that GRAW does.
777	Pretty decent, especially compared to other burrito places like Burito Boyz or Fat Bastard burrito. I ordered the grilled veggie burrito, with lots of hot sauce. The hot sauce didn't help, and the fillings were very bland. It was definitely cheaper than the other, cost me about $7 for the regular size burrito, but tasted so bad I'd obviously much rather pay more for a good burrito! Would definitely not recommend.
778	My wife and I love this place. We take people here all the time. They just changed the nachos from a wonderful tasty chip to ones that are meh. For a Mexican place you would think they would stay with what works. Hopefully the other locations do not use these sub par chips. We will not be ordering out guac / salsa / and chips anymore. Why bother,
779	My husband (the American and stingy with his stars) has had his fair share of NY deli meats (pastrami/corned beef) so I was a bit nervous about bringing him here since for me their smoked meat is simply the best. He tried it and loved it! So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out (don't let the long lines ruin your experience!).
780	I was less than impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain. I looked for a place to stop in Madison while on a business trip and found this place. I had planned to do some work in the tea shop but it was very warm in the space and didn't seem like a place I could get anything done. The tapioca pearls were fantastic and clearly fresh so that was good. I got a mango fruit tea and it was just too sweet and there was no ice in it so it got warm fast with the warm tapioca pearls. The kid who helped me didn't seem to be there or particularly helpful for a first-timer like me and I was a little disappointed to get a regular lid instead of the fun shrink wrapped cup to stab the straw into like I find at most bubble tea shops.
781	Burgers are good but just not worth the price. Ordered the holy smokes with fries and a can of pepsi. Can't remember the exact price but it was nearly $20!! Burger was very good and the portion of fries was pretty hefty so that was a plus, they were also pretty good. The only thing I'm having trouble with is how they justify the price for what is essentially a takeaway burger place. I've had burgers in restaurants that were cheaper! I'd give it 4 stars if based just on the food but have to give it 3 because of the price. Probably wouldn't get it again because of that.
782	K O'Donnells is definitely the place to be! When it comes to food, this place has everything! You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Not only do they have the stellar food, they have an award winning doggy patio! I bring my dog very frequently to socialize with other dogs. If your looking for a happy hour come in from 3-7 and get some food and ice cold beers! You can't go wrong with the daily specials and those speciality martini's!
783	Frequent customer at this chipotle! It is nice and close to my house. It is located near the happy valley round about which can get super busy when everyone is getting off work so we like to go early or a little later to avoid the rush. It's also busy so the line gets lunch especially at lunch time but is typically pretty fast. Good food and great customer service. The manager Thomas is awesome and so friendly. He recognizes my fiancé and I as frequent customers and always greets us and asks us about our day. I switch off from a burrito and bowl. With my burrito I ask them to mix it up and it's so delicious! I also get half chicken half steak so I get the best of both worlds for 1 price. Love having a healthy quick option to go eat lunch or dinner. Would definitely recommend this to others (: Oh and 1 thing I don't like.... it's always super cold in here. Haha so bring a jacket.
784	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy so we assumed it was because of that. The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean, but the food was average. The food quality was not what I was expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.
785	because your own clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want it's coolio hoolio
786	Firefox takes the best of all previous browsers and sticks it all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features. And those times when FF seems to eat up a lot of memory? That's just the cache so you're able to surf the net even faster. Just lower the cache if you don't want to eat so much memory.
787	I use Linux, and thanks to god, not existing an IE version for Linux! Firefox is open, you can do anything with that and no one will process you about that ;) oh yeah, and it's safe, cute, have addons, easy install, patches realeased in less time, etc, etc...
788	Who said anything about firefox/mozilla having anything to do with steve jobs/apple? Seperate enititys, not in the least bit attached! BTW, IE blows when making pages and trying to get things to look right. FF sticks to world wide web consortiums standards much closer than IE ever did or will.
789	If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.
790	India will not lead the world because the gap between the rich and poor is too great and they still heavily believe in the caste system.
791	this does not even make sense no one country should lead the world we all started together and thats the way it should end and everyone has there ways this is just not logical at all
792	syona if look at glance, then most of us are unable to specify any solid solutions by which we can remove the hurdle in our progress from root.we all are very much aware of problems but unable to give solutions.they are criticizing government,terrorism and so on.no one realizes that being a citizen what is our duty? everyone should understand abt. their importance and role for country.Because a good citizen,a criminal,terrorist,corrupted politician, everyone is human, then why a human is creating problem for another human.I hope you will think my views and reply me soon.
793	I would rather be fatherless than to have a bad father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.
794	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
795	To be able to have a succeful trading port you must have good contacts with many people and raffles had those contacts without him we would not have a trading port at all!
796	Some would say that raffles left singapore for a few years and left farquer incharge therefore he neglected us. Imagine SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have done so much for us and are considered the founders of us are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care OF THEIR OWN SCHOOLS. Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time would you say he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting singapore? He has a life!
797	porn is wrong unless it has lesbians in it in fact i am downloading porn even as i type
798	Porn is wrong.. If people watch it... They will want to do a free sex... Free Sex will bring disease especially HIV... In morallity it is wrong...
799	depending on your beleifs because im christian i think it is but to someone else whos not christian it may be completly ok
800	it should not be about how we got here but why are we here.
801	If evolution is real then find me someone/something that is half way
802	hey nobrob wasnt ie invented before firefox ah derrrr!!!!!!!!
803	Well personally I believe Google Chrome is crap but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
804	Most of the government sites in India is designed for IE, so it is important to have IE in your computer
805	physical education teaches kids that it dosent matter if your a nerd or a jock because if theyre all in the same class doing the same thing then theyre all the same in the aspect that they only pass that class if they put forth effort. and from personal expence sometimes there is a jock underneath the nerd outside
806	The answer is so obvious. Teachers should let everyone exercise so they can strengthen their muscles and get thinner and more flexible instead of fatter and more lazy so they won't get bullied as much.
807	physical education should be mandatory cuhz 112,000 people have died in the year 2011 so far and it's because of the lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese!!!!
808	i think that PE classes should be obligatory in school to help the problem of obesity.
809	because today lots of students are playing computer games when the school finish. and than students can't get good health and also can get serious dieases like cancer because of electromagnetic waves. this is true because computers have lots of electromagnetic waves.
810	Because PE lessons provide chances to people to realize on what they are capable of doing,so it will strengthen the self-esteem leading to them being productive in their society.
811	Raffles removed Farquhar from his position in Singapore and accused him of'being too close to the local population '. I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be sent off like that.
812	The right to abortion should not be abused, however I do believe that the choice should be provided. NOBODY should make decisions of what an individual should do with their body.
813	it's the woman's choice. you cannot control her. (anyway how do u know she just wouldn't kill herself in attempt to kill her baby as well?)
814	Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make in her life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision? If a woman can not support a child (Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child.
815	It really depends on the situation; if a girl/woman gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that's her fault for not being prepared.
816	Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers, ironic huh? Women are people too, and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.
817	its simple, how would we be able to adapt to different enviroments. over time we adapted to what suited us best, otherwise why arn't we one skin colour, why are there so many types of animals
818	i LIKE porn, masturbation is always a good time
819	Yeah, women are degraded by pornography, but if it's already done, why shouldn't we watch it? We can't stop something that has already happened, so let's just go for it :P
820	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.
821	Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometimes you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.
822	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if I'm looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If I focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
823	Frankly, if kids didn't dress like drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing.
824	That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i thought what to wear? It was really problem, I spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school had own uniform and everybody had to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!
825	year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear. in the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. a uniform shows students equality.
826	In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status. Some may be rich, some may not be that rich. So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them. If there is no uniform, then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them. Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths. So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries.
827	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't complain to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.
828	I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.
829	It is better to have a father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
830	I rather have a bad father then not have a father at all. Having a bad father you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix it if he's bad you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and would want to know who he is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
831	I would much rather have a lousy father than be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way.

834	tv is more effective than books because you learn easier by seeing not reading
835	Marriage is between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live in sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spread their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society. (Lord of the Flies)
836	I already had my say in the debate and we Indians at least managed to learn these mongrel's language and we are pretty good at it. But the rest of you English gimmicks stumble in your own tongue. I am quoting some sush102 "Hey its better dnt teach me wats da difference between chatng nd debatng..... If i start my debate na den u bloody will b 4ced to leave this site nd run away." What crap? "dnt", "ma" "dis" what kind of crap is that???
837	The Indian economy is galloping at a breakneck speed and might even reach double-digit growth by 2013, feel Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. Many economists agree that the demographic dividend that India enjoys could see the country sustain its high growth rate for a long time to come.
838	India certainly has d potentials 2 lead d world..... in our real world power and weapons doesn't work any more maybe................... maybe USA,UK or such other contries are more powerful but India is economically more strong.it is d hub 4 many other companies.
839	India is in my personal list of countries to keep an eye on over the next thirty years because I think they're a good contender for superpower status before the end of this century.
840	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of a god, there would be no valid proof that that god is Christian or not.
841	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
842	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
843	I say yes because children are becoming more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.
844	Yes, because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again. The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them.
845	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... There's a trend... (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)
846	i am christian so i have to back up my religion and i also get to go to church.
847	I am neither Christian nor Atheist, but despite I believe that Christianity is better than Atheism.If there is no place for God in your life, it can not even be callad as a "life".
848	Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I wouldn't feel safe if we had children in the house or sleeping next to her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years.
849	I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. Being a murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger. So from these reasons I would turn my spouse in.
850	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you're an accomplice. I don't care what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone. The second she tells me, I will call the police, just in case she either goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me.
851	the one whom bestows life, is the one whom bestows death
852	I'm pro-life based on one major fact.... abortion being used the way it is today... like a last minute form of birth control. If you're not smart enough to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have them.
853	A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead? If you are raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?
854	I argue for the rights of the child, who deserves the same right to life as the mother.
855	There are students who don't like Physical Education, so, it should be an elective subject.
856	This is not a commonly known fact - Can you point me to a reference? Or do you mean that gay _sex_ is helping spread the disease? In which case gay marriage may help reduce the problem.
857	I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it! People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
858	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.
859	Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.
860	I dont think many countries consider men with men acceptable. It's almost always taboo in society/main religions. I doubt as a whole people will ever really accept the union as a union under god. However, they should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that's what they're doing. Ignorant people seem to get these two mixed. It's their business what happens under the sheets.
861	yes they do have more power than they advertise. since 9-11 the government has passed things such as "The Patriot Act" and "terror Watch". Terror Watch allows the government to essentially spy on law abiding citizens when that is forbidden in the constitution. The Patriot Act allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on again law abiding citizens and the ability to search cars,homes and businesses without a warrent which is also contradictory to the writting of the constitution.
862	Should they be arrested? No, but there should definately be a huge fine!!
863	I don't particularly believe in psychics myself, but if in a situation of desperation, most people, including me, would do whatever it takes to get things done. A friend of mine had a sister that was missing for almost 2 years, her family finally decided to use a psychic, between the police and the psychic, her sister's body was found.
864	Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried go back to the chat room and ask what they can do to keep you safe. I don't think you can be traced by the paedo though because of data protection. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
865	The difficulty in answering yes and no questions is not so much the specific question and the honest answer, but the implications of that answer. For example, do you like chocolate ice cream? Yes or no. The answer does not imply that you do not like vanilla. So it is with personal and embarrassing questions too. It is the implication of the answer that is the problem.
866	Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think). If you've ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human yet and it has no brain function and thus can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence (for anybody wanting to ask 'how can you be sure?', all I can say is that I'm not - this is only what I've read). Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it. Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do. Every one of them wrestles with their own morals and conscience in their own way.
867	I think it all starts earlier than one suspects. For instance, when I was once in a position where I needed to recruit a typist, I suggested to Human Resources that perhaps this was a job which might be made available to a disabled person who might otherwise find it hard to gain employment. I encountered bafflement. "Any particular disability?" I was asked.
868	They can now and here in Florida it is legal for a person to shoot if they feel that they are in danger for their life. And you know what, if someone bashed my door down I'd shoot first and ask questions later. I think this may be very bad for all the police trying to do their jobs. What in Gods' name were they thinking? Some right wingers may think this is OK but heaven help the cops.
869	I assume you are referring to the entire criminal justise system as the professional group. As in the series Law and Order it involves enforcement as well as the legal profession. Part of the system is the law makers as well. Public policy is not always easy to define. Power and influence in an ideal democaracy would come from the people but we know that isn't really true, eoungh money will sway public opinion and buy almost any election and swing almost any vote whether it is public or in legistature. I am not sure what you mean by "playing policy roles" The direct enforcers offer direct power. The police and the judges. But those who actually make the laws provide the true power and that comes back to the people with money to buy influence to change laws. It really all goes back to the rich and powerful.
870	You could probably file a defamation of character lawsuit. I doubt the police would do anything about this. However, a lawsuit would be expensive and messy for both parties. You're better off letting it slide, taking the high road and living your life honorably, knowing that these people are petty and not worthy of your attentions. Light always shines through the darkness and I'm sure the people who know you are aware of your character.
871	Violent rape and child molestation deserve the death penalty, though I'd settle for life sentence. Right now we have sex offender lists to protect the public against these people who have been released from prison. What kind of sense does this make? We make the lists because they are still dangerous; but if they're dangerous, why are they out of prison? I say, just kill them all. Problem solved.
872	Lawyers are sly as foxes. They typically only ask questions that they already know the answers to. They use various tactics to get you to say what they want you to say, unless of course the lawyer is defending or representing you. Some lawyers speak in a very demanding voice in an attempt to undermine your confidence and to dispute the truth of your statements. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is not to play into this by keeping a cool head, remain calm at all times. If you seem unconfident, you may lose your case.
873	Thats just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...It's just "feel good" legislation. Makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant) Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. (And crime rates drop). And for the record, the second amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a government that goes out of control. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.
874	This is a Left at the gate horse. I am a person to whom the reading of a law book is as simple as reading a comic book. First you would need a lawyer to win. That constitutional right about bringing your own case is wiped out by judges who do not want to be bothered by non-lawyers. Second you would need evidence that the persons actions caused you "Increased anxiety" As the tesimony of a theropist. Then it would depend on your state laws. This is a hard case to prove, you might even have to prove the person should have known their actions would harm you. Get ahold of either Legal aid, or the attorney Generals office to see if they have information on how you can make the elements of a winning case.
875	It matters to those of us who attended schools where all this was important, have or had parents to whom it was important, and have jobs where it is important. If you can get through life without any of those applying to you, then you may well conclude that it is all somewhat irrelevant and who can blame you?
876	see... it's a little thing called freedom... maybe a grandpa of yours died for it... but people are free to talk how they want to talk and write how they want to write... if you don't like it... you don't have to talk to them... or do business at a place that caters to spanish speaking people... I mean in China towns accross the nation for years, Chinese and other asian languages are spoken and advertised... the government has a lot it needs to do before it needs to worry about what language people are speaking... and as people of your "sort" seem to often say... if you don't like how America is doing it... maybe you should leave...
877	Oil does rule all politics unfortunately but can I suggest a simple alternative that we could all see as common sense? Use wind or wave power to generate electricity. Use this energy to split water into its prime components. Let oxygen into the air. Burn the Hydrogen in our cars and have water as the resulting by product. You could almost make this work in your back garden! We would only need lubricating oils then which could probably be created from vegetable sources!
878	From an ethical standpoint, I think you should pay her back. She made it clear that it was a loan, and you agreed to it. Even if you were desperate, you accepted the deal. From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract: offer and acceptance. Your granddaughter offered you a loan of a thousand dollars, and you accepted it. There was consideration (something of value was exchanged) - you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment. I take from your question that you don't want to pursue legal action against your granddaughter, for which you are to be commended. In order to salvage your relationship with her, I think you should repay her, tell her that this is the only wedding gift you can afford is repaying the debt, and LET IT GO.
879	Yes it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. Don't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while there.
880	You won't receive a warrant, I'm sure one has been issued, but they are not required to notify you that a warrant has been issued. Call the court and make payment arrangements. You'll have to pay the original fine, plus warrant fees, possibly interest and whatever else the local laws allow them to tack on. Or you can just ignore it and the next time you get stopped for a simple traffic violation you can get arrested for an outstanding warrant.
881	EDIT: Don't bash Clinton! He eliminated the deficit, and we had a surplus for a short time. All the while we survived and the economy was good. Bush blew it. He saddled us with that deficit. What's it up to? Eight TRILLION plus? Who's paying for the Iraq war? Who's paying to rebuild the place? Where is the Iraqi oil money? They are selling oil. Where do you think that money is going?
882	In my own opinion, psychological treatment is the best way to treat criminals rather than sending them to prisons. I believe that nobody is born to be a criminal. The primary determinant for a person to be such, is being brought up in a not-so-wholesome family/environment. With a proper nurture, a person can grow and mature well. So, with the help of those psychologists and or psychiatrists the bad behaviors of those persons can be cured and remedied.
883	We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there scratching each others' backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate. Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits. Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System, that is.
884	I'm having a hard time believing you actually got fined for tossing a butt out of your window, unless your area has a risk of forest fire then I could understand. Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation. Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage? Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road? The main question you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?" If you think that you can win the case then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system great. The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.
885	If they're in your car and you're driving, then yes. I don't know about Illinois, but in California you're responsible for the passengers in your car, minors or not. If one of your passengers isn't wearing a seatbelt, you can get a ticket in addition to them getting one, even if they're an adult. When they're not in your car (or even just if you're not driving it) you're not responsible for them unless you and their parents sign something saying you are.
886	Ok. You have to be careful on how you play your game here because if he can prove that anything you say about him is untrue he may have grounds for his deformation suit. If he has wronged you, there are a couple of things you can do: 1. Sue him for the wrong he did to you. 2. Contact the better business bureau in your area 3. Report what he did to the government group that regulates car dealers in your area 4. Contact the TV station in your area that does customer complaint reporting.
887	Seek legal advice. I mean if your gonna loose your job anyway and maybe your home for lack of money. What have you got to loose? Your kids could starve you could loose everything you own. Do something before that happens. The company will be heartbroken I'm sure!!!!!! Most of them couldn't care less about there people, and will try to get you to quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment. Seen it to many times. Just ask a lawyer about your case, they don't have to know you asked them. The lawyer will tell you if you even have a chance. Won't cost to ask!
888	How can it not? Inside they have their own laws, and I do not mean prison laws. To live you must obey them, if not you could very well end up dead. It is sad to say but some of our prisons are run by the gangs inside them. The prisoners behind bars have it so good any more that prison is no deterrent to crime at all.
889	i dont understand how in the world he took the kids away from their mother...that is something that is extremly hard to do in the courts...but i think that if she wants her family back that bad and feels like if she dont have her family back that theirs no meaning in her life then support her but also remind her to becareful and try to save some money on the side for herself just incase...maybe he really does love her and realized that the grass wasnt greener on the otherside and now he wants his old happy life back....just try and help her secretly save some money as a just incase fund....i wish your sister the best.
890	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country — whether citizens or non-citizens — *without* the scrutiny and oversight of judges, who are in the last instance answerable to the law and to the public, they are creating a domain within the state that is exempt from the sovereignty of the people. This undermines democracy (however fake of a democracy it is anyway) and creates a state within the statue — usually thought to be a distinguishing feature of dictatorships, in which secret services, torturers, etc. are also neither answerable to the law nor to the people.
891	Why, gay man here, can be fired for being gay at any job in the country, can't have a civil union with my partner of 9 years, no domestic partner rights, hell if it were up to some I would be better of on some deserted island with like kind........not free for me..........but still grateful to be an american and for those fighting for what rights i do have
892	well at the end of the day a womens body tells her when shes ready, she starts a period, but mature enough is another matter
893	Yes. You can be emancipated if you're not pregnant, but certainly it provides a judge with a fairly obvious reason to approve the request. I did it...It took about 30 minutes of completing the forms, a couple of signatures, and 5 minutes in front of the judge. Fairly easy, really. And certainly, I do recommend it, if you're going to need to be the one who signs for things on behalf of your child. Most people won't question you, but it's good to have in your back pocket, just in case.
894	They should be tortured.....when they castrate them they should do it without giving them pain medication. I don't think it's fair when people get the death penalty all that they "suffer" is a little injection by a lethal shot! When they die they have no worries and then we get to pay for it with our tax dollars!! The person/family they committed the crime against usually is tortured and suffereing for the rest of their lives! It should be "eye for eye tooth for tooth"
895	What does that mean? Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights. By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.
896	I believe our lives are our own and no one has the right to take it, except ourselves. If the pain, suffering and lack of hope is so unbearable, one should have the right to end his or her own life, being it by himself/herself or by asking someone else to do it. For example, my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I think is ridiculous for obvious reasons. And if the person isn't able to do it on his/her own, asking someone to do it, either by ending his life through "direct" methods such as a painless poisoning or by "indirect" methods such as turning off the machine that keep that person's heart beating. PLEASE keep in mind I'm talking about VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA, not non-voluntary euthanasia or involuntary euthanasia.
897	Look at the brain from a physical/chemical perspective. Neurons are fired when we see/smell/hear/touch/taste things. Those neurons interact with other neurons via chemical processes that are well understood. Eventually, those neurons interact with more neurons, and so on, and so on... Eventually, motor neurons are triggered which cause us to respond to the sensory input. In no part of this process can I see a way to affect the chain reaction of neurons in any way. Sure, each of our brains is put together differently and that means that each of us will respond differently to similar stimuli. But given the EXACT same situation our brains will react exactly the same way to the exact same stimuli every time. So essentially, you never had a choice.
898	My reasoning is simple: - dishwashers require the dishes to be "pre cleaned". This already defeats the purpose, why did I pay hundreds of dollars for a machine that doesn't have food processing capabilities?
899	By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people are more privileged than other races. For example, assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school is no different than assuming that all white people live easy, privileged lives.
900	And the invasion of gaza is unjustified as well as impractical. Its the same as iraq, you dont stop terrorism by coming in and destroying peoples lives up, palestinians already hate israel and terrorising gaza only radicalises people and turns them into hamas militants. Aside from that israel has shown blatant disregard for civilians lives, 50 israelis have died vs 1500 palestinians. That alone should show you who is the aggressor and who is caught in the crossfire This is not about hamas vs israel its about the people born in gaza and caught up in it. The invasion is terrorism designed to kill civilians and scare gaza into subservience.
901	Those who are calling for amnesty to be given to illegals have yet provided no rational reasons as to why they should be granted citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and a replies as to why they hold no argument.
902	At the end of the day governments simply use propaganda that a soda tax will reduce obesity, but the reality is its just them being greedy trying to make even more money off the poor and middle class.
903	I saw the movie and felt like I had just wasted a chunk of my life. The only two scenes that were interesting at all were the ouija board scene and the ending. The rest was just people sleeping with the occasional noise. I can appreciate a slow build (I loved The Blair Witch Project), but Paranormal Activity was just boring to me. I understand completely that taste is subjective, but it is beyond me how anyone could think that film was entertaining or artistically noteworthy. Also, please do not use the sequels to defend the quality of the first film. I want to understand why the first film was so acclaimed even before any sequels were released.
904	I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public &amp; such. Psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.
905	In addition to diabetics, people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants would die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people.
906	School's are a government run institution, designed for the betterment of it's students. As such it's only fair that schools should provide a free, quality lunch for it's pupils. For three primary reasons: 1. It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the pupils be there for an upwards of 7 hours feed them. 2. If you want to curb obesity, 3. Not all students can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning.
907	Prostitution is between two consenting adults. Say the prostitute is in need of money - it is her/his choice how she earns the money and uses her/his body. To address people who claim prostitutes are "at the mercy" of their clients: this makes government regulation even more necessary. For people who associate prostitution with violence and crime (drugs), wouldn't it be much safer if it were legal, regulated and taxed? It would reduce the crime associated with prostitution (although much of the crime stigma is hollywood-created), increase tax revenue and provide safe regulations.
908	I understand there is a lot of disdain towards people who post a question or an image that has been posted before, however I personally think it's a good thing that people do that. It's true that the person posting the question could easily do a search of previous posts and get their questions answered, but that deprives all the viewers of seeing an answer if they never thought of that question in the first place.
909	Private property owners calling a towing company to impound the vehicle on thier behalf is tantamount to theft and should be illegal. I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, but only if the police are involved just as they would be if they were having a trespasser removed. In that case the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a *police* impound lot.
910	I've read some scientific racism writing and I think many of its claims have no scientific basis. Shouldn't the differences between races be studied? People of different origins have different bodies (skeletton, skin color...) why wouldn't they have a different brain? Note that I don't think any race is superior to the other, just different. Just like the differences between gender doesn't make one superior to another. On another hand I don't want such research to be done because that could be misinterpreted by hateful people and lead to a resurgence of racism.
911	Please leave the footnote below the body of your post, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post. Thank you! _____ While the relic is interesting it has little historical significance. Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose. Shortly after recovering the Cross, Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan. He thanks Mr. Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection. So we know Dr. Jones doesn't feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing. Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum. CMV.
912	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens possibly use to gain better insight about humanity? Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that humanity has collectively put together.
913	I think we should be putting millions into research of doing animal combinations. For example: a half gorilla half octopus. Face is similar to an octopus and has 2 legs and 6 wavy arms and its also furry. I don't buy the "don't play god" argument because I'm not worried about god smiting us for creating abominations. Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering about your house. Sure the research would cost a lot and some animals might get hurt but I really feel the end result would be worth it.
914	I am a professional Software Engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field. Software should never be able to be patented (just Copywrighted) this includes software algorithims * Most software algorithms are not non-obvious * Software Algorithms for more complicated stuff (Compression Algorithm, communication standards etc etc) are also obvious to people in the field * The only thing that should be protectable is the final product * It doesnt give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products. * Most meaningful software used is open sourced, what companies pay for is the specialized tailoring that is done to build a custom application; again your product is protectable by copyright not patent.
915	I'm not the one who created this topic by the way. But people free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound good in THEORY, 100% pure capitalism won't work. Note that I am not advocating socialism, just a form of capitalism.
916	i think black ppl give more of a bad name!...only bcuz more then half of all jails are black ppl and u barely c white people on tv when anything bad happins! u mostly see rappers who r black go to jail for some stupid stuff and u nevr c any country singers that r white go anywhere bad!..im not sayin white ppl arent bad to cuz there are things that go on with them to but its all mostly black ppl!!...i think all monkeys and krackers shouldcreated equaly....but seperatly!
917	This whole smoking prohibition in public places is overrated, why can’t it just be a matter of decency, if a smoker is among nonsmokers then he shouldn’t smoke, if he have to then he just can go smoke a cigarette in the toilet or something like that, I believe if we involve manners in this issue we won’t have a problem at all.
918	8 years ago I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now I have to admit that there is little chance of the facts being avaliable to them via regional news vendors and so this might be a decent plan B. Do what your told America, but by someone marginally smarter than the current guy. Apathy has worked well so far and tv tells you which burger taste best so I guess they know which President is best too.
919	I don't think its a waste of time but i think it is pointless because our world (Earth) Has its own bigger problem like world poverty, population, polution, and the biggest threat...Global warming. Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could be foucusing on our world problems frist and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and near the end we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientist caring to much about other things when there lives also could be in stake.
920	Filtered, no. Standardized, yes. There should be domain extensions (y'know the.com,.net,.org,...) that are specific to "unsavory" industries. For example, porn sites should all be required to use a.xxx extension so that a router can be programmed to block all incoming connections from a.xxx site. This way parents can block a whole group of sites by blocking domain extensions.
921	This is easy, classical music is stagnant, most classical music fans are snobbish, they want to hear exactly how it was performed several centuries ago. They put down so-called "neo-classical" Jazz is always evolving, it is a living art form. It is always adapting the latest music trends-yet remains jazz. Jazz can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, RnB, soul, hip hop, world music, folklore et al and it is still jazz. Oh yeah sire they are purists but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way two times, it is different and fresh every time it is played Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the US of A-New Orleans, made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown, jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity.
922	Hoooraaa to the Supreme Court for getting this right. While the ruling did make headlines most people don't understand how important it really was. The right of Habeus Corpus is foundational to a free society and to liberty for ALL. This ruling is a referendum on the wanton disregard of Bush an his administration to do something they all promised to do - protect the constitution.
923	Yes, it isn't that tough, my grandma got married for about 50 and that only ended because she died. I've been married for 7, Johnny Cash was married to June Carter for more than 40 years, George Takei has been with the same guy for almost 30, people do it all the time.
924	With one day Cricket (40 overs) and Twenty20 Cricket (20 overs) taking a hold on the Cricket world, bringing much needed excitement and excitement and a new generation of cricketers, it is time for Test Cricket to step down.
925	Each religion is in the process of spreading their count they dont care if they believe from heart. may be thats the reason why most terrorist are converts, may thats the reason why most people those who are converts in christianity are poor people.and they aare shown the bait of money. so wht it is spread of belief or the head count. i think its the head count.
926	Terminaionater because he is made of full metal and pluse in the movie he said that he can live for millions of years. pluse he can see every thing when in is dark. All so he he way much smarter than rob cop. Rob cop he is just hafe human and hafe metal see thats stupid if he gets shout in the mouth he would die. and allso every time he gets hit really bad he will die quicker. but that why the termanater is so much better. Like if he gets shout he wont die at all he looses his own arm he can still walk really fast.
927	The Bush administration and now John McCain equate any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemy governments or countries/political parties they consider as terrorist to be useless at best. He supports his position by comparing any attempts to talk to Hamas or Iran or other terrorist groups as "foolish delusion" and equates diplomacy to "the false comfort of appeasement" of the Nazi's. My feeling is that this position actually weakens the USA. It's time the government of the USA realizes we can talk to Cuba, Iran or Hamas as part of a comprehensive foreign policy approach and that be shutting the door on diplomacy we actually encourage aggression against the USA.
928	How are you going to enforce it? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car." Will certainty give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of tax payers. Cops already doing tests if they suspect you were drinking -- it's not random but probable cause. Guess what. if you were drinking and cops do not suspect your drinking habits, it is because your Alcoholic content is below DUI. Some cops don't like the extra effort, and paperwork stopping people for DUI. Do you think random testing will solve this problem?
929	...rather than informative news coverage. Sorry about that. Well, what do you think? The media has become a breeding ground for industry and rich businessman with cigars. They no longer inform. Is anyone reminded about the 1976 movie "The Network". I have heard about it, and that can be displayed as evidence that, today, the news is no longer the news. It's all for the television ratings, and to get them, they need to use ridiculous tactics.
930	I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes, i retained more in both because we were given assignments involving drawing and comics. Doodling has helped me focus more on whatever my teachers are saying, simple squiggly lines do the best. Though i must admit that when i start to "doodle" my doodles tend to turn into full blown drawings, shading and color thrown into the mix. Thats when i get off task... i should probably figure out how to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just sketch and doodle stuff...
931	I'm going to say the machines, simply cause it doesent matter which kind of machine we're talking about either terminator or like "i robot" they are not easy to kill. Zombies its 1 shot to the head or taking the head off and its game over. Plus machines can controle other machines like cars, supercomputers, cell phones and a whole citys power sorce and plus military weapons like Jets and tanks etc. and once they get ahold of guns and such were gonna have a HUGE WAR on our Hands
932	Indeed, why? It's mere presence should be as unusual as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation. It should not be a part of who we are.
933	it had a good plot. it was your typical revenge story, but they didn't reveal that until the end. it had a good twist. and underlying it all, it had somewhat of a moral. if you are going to complain about the audio as your reason for it being a bad movie then you need to get off your pretentious pedestal and hang out with the rest of humanity.
934	Ate here this past Friday and the food was delicious! Something that really stood out for me was the F'n Loaded Sliders. Filet Minion mixed with blue cheese and a bottom less basket of garlic fries! It was so good and the prices are not what you'd expect for such a delicious meal. Your getting P.F Chang's but without the hit to your wallet and in my opinion way better food. We can't wait to go back!
935	Have not been to a Sizzler in decades, but the quality of food and service at this location was pretty spot on. The salad and soup bar and ice cream was only $6.49 at lunch (2 bucks more if you want taco/hot bar which looked very average). They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken rice gone wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons) and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this neck of the woods.
936	This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack on the weekends. I love that you can order half size of the appetizers... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually will bring our pooch, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of the chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are! I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice),and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner. This is a great choice, and on a nice day, you cannot beat that location and view on the patio!
937	PROS: Room cost roughly $60.00 per night. Room was very clean and very modern. CONS: Front desk is a joke! Check in takes about a half an hour, called down for extra towels & was on hold for ten mins before I gave up. Will stay again if I have no other choice but make sure I have everything I need before leaving the front desk as you cannot get ahold of them after check in.
938	Unless you want security to treat your fiancé badly don't go here. I don't care if Tiesto or Calvin Harris is playing here it is a joke. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult and/or hurt them. My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and sore for a few days. Way to have a 300lb security guard push a shove/grab a 120lb woman in heals, hope your ego is soaring. And btw we hadn't had a drink yet.
939	This was probably the worst ribeye steak I have ever had. No seasoning and really over cooked when we requested medium well. The service wasn't the best either...it wasn't busy, but it took a long time to get our food...and our server forgot to put in our order for the kids so they ended up just eating our French fries. We decided we'd just forego the additional wait and go somewhere else to eat. At least the set up was neat and the kids had a great time playing outside!
940	We have been to Carpe Diem a few times before their move to Elizabeth. We tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner. Big Mistake. While granted, it was a Monday night (I get that in the restaurant industry), the food was pretty much awful. Over-seasoned...overdone. Steak overcooked; Quail undecipherable in it's bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce. Wine overpriced. Salad uninteresting and dressing was boring. Appetizer meatballs....well, regular meatballs without pasta. The descriptions were nice but the food didn't live up to it. They had our table decorated (for our anniversary) but didn't offer a glass of wine, an appetizer, nor a dessert for our special occasion. Expensive and night.
941	The service was very good and the food was expensive but the sliders I got weren't cooked all of the way through and the buns were greasy. I would order the fries and sit at the bar as the service was great but would not order the sliders again.
942	Only in private schools and even there I would only agree with it because its a voluntary association. You see I think school uniforms suppress free speech, and take away from a youth's individuality.
943	I'm too lazy to explain why so take my word for it. I had to wear one for 4 years at school.
944	It is not comfortable when you sit for an extended period of time in a classroom.
945	I'm using Firefox right now because it makes searching the internet relatively easier than using internet explore.
946	The fact that the only reasonable argument IE users have is that they are cooler or get laid more only proves that firefox is better.
947	at least firefox is not a copycat like internet explorer 7, who copied firefox on the tabs.
948	No way, That's even better than a prenup :) her: "I'm leaving you and taking half your shit." me: "Hope you like prison b*tch"
949	As human beings, we are selfish and have been fabricated with a survival mechanism that tells us to do whatever whenever to protect the ones that we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means taking this secret to the grave.
950	If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it, I wouldn't turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.
951	I dont believe i would turn them in because of love.But i certainly would not stay with her; i would move away from her as far as i could. For the simple reason i wouldnt want to be involved with the crime, because i knew about it.
952	No, India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires, they cant even lead themselves.
953	nope last time i checked rags were for scrubbing toilets not headgear. Whooo! USA
954	Nah, they can't even organize their streets! They bathe in the same river in which they bury their dead and defecate in - the Ganges! They're extremely poor - they can't even manage their own budget, much less a planet! I'm going to get down-voted and insulted, but everything I have written is the truth.
955	I would rather be father less it might sound bad but I dont want to think of my father as a bad one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just keep bringing you problems. You dont have to have a father you can talk to someone else. Maybe its just because I am girl it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.
956	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be tough and dependant on themselves. Being fatherless is hard but when it comes down to it, it is better to be fatherless than to have a bad father. If you had a bad father, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.
957	Farquhar has a boss!(raffles) he has to follow raffles and not go about doing anything else if then why cant farquhar help singapore after he was fired? I say again you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, effort is all invested. You must know people who would help you.
958	Raffles was the one who stopped Singapore from being taken by the Dutch, as the Dutch were upset that Singapore would be taken by the British. but he stopped the Dutch from taking Singapore. If it had not been for him, the Dutch would have taken Singapore.
959	Is porn good for ur health?No it isnot opponents say that porn doont have a serious effects on health. however studies have shown that porn and practice it can damage ur health slowly especially ur immune system. sooner or later thos who do porn in thier relationships definitely they donot have good health as others. here is a key question. smoking is bad for u. smokers feel good when they smoke but smoke 100% leads to thier death and porn have the same influence on the health i think that smoke is better than porn in facr both of them are extremely bad for u
960	firefox is so bloated now. It uses way more memory. Once everyone buys a new PC, and gets IE7, they'll have no excuse to switch to firefox. fireFox better get their act together. They are becoming more and more like Mozillia who got got gutted from a bloated Netscape. fireFox needs to get gutted. It shouldn't take all my system's memory to use a web browser.
961	If you hover over IE7's tabs, the tooltip has the page title and address. Firefox 2.0 just has the title.
962	IE is much easier to use, and it also is more visually appealing. Additionally, it is much more secure as well.
963	Most people think that PE classes are completely useless because the only thing you would normally do in a PE class is run around.
964	It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later on in life. Plus, there's the benefit of working together as a team that doesn't always happen in other classes.
965	You are 100% right because I am in Pe and they make us wear these stupid outfits. I think they make us wear those so the gay coaches can see our private parts. and PE is just stupid
966	William Farquhar was sacked. Despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development, he adopted measures in his administration which conflicted with Raffles' instructions, so a lot of people would just ignore Farquhar's contribution and credit them to Raffles
967	When Farquar was dismissed by Raffles, he was given a grander ceremony before he left compared to Raffles, which show how much the people loved him.
968	The people recognized William Farquhar as the founder because he was there to deal with the country's problems when Raffles failed to be there for them. William Farquhar even took money out of his own pocket to resolve certain issues. When he was forced to leave, the people sent him off with sorrow in their hearts.
969	While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision to be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.
970	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is a load of crap. This is what makes these kinds of debates pointless. You have some creationists, who don't understand anything about science. sabrejimmy hasn't attempted to learn anything from this debate. He continues to ask ridiculous questions. Personally, I think I will have to ignore his future posts. Intelligent debate is satisfying, but this isn't.
971	I call the god that creationists believe in the "God of the Gaps." Early man's understanding of the universe was extremely limited. For example, people did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical, but man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.
972	Evolution does occur and it has been documented, and studied. i invite you to read this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and give you your thoughts.
973	Porn is not wrong. As an abstract noun, it cannot be wrong.
974	All humans have sexual desires. However, sometimes, one just isn't in the mood for sex, and would like simple release. Pornography facilitates this.
975	The question is: who has the right to prohibit it? Government? Why would there be any pressing need at all for the state to outlaw pornography? Look at Europe- they're cool with pretty much everything. I don't see any moral depravity in Europe, do you?
976	Porn is not always wrong in most cases. Sometimes it's in very bad taste, but when it's giving equal gratification, etc. to all parties, there's nothing wrong, and I could even consider it an art form in some respects.
977	Advancing the common good is much more important. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help ourselves.
978	According to the educational resources, as fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they do with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.
979	I think that school uniform is a good idea. First it's make students look nice and tidy. Second we can know that who is studying in which school or who is in a same school with us. And finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time choosing clothes to school
980	I think that it will be better to have an lousy father than no father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you grow up. If he is a bad father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you become a better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to be better than your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be.
981	I would have to choose a father. I think having a father figure around even though he might not do much for you or the family is better than none. A father to me plays a huge role in a childs life he keeps things stable throughout your childhood. My father is pretty bad but he does support me and helps out sometimes. I would rather have a father than none.
982	Yeah I have a bottle of water next to me its a no bid deal!
983	Bottled water should be only used for emergencies weather it be natural or human disaster. To help people in need and not pollute the environment and harm habitats by dumping in the ocean or in landfills. Plastic does not decompose so in that case do not use it for emergencies.
984	TV,,!! because you can get information from different resources in a short time,,, but books you must read a lot to get that much of information!!
985	can be recycled to make other things. like more water bottles. it also makes the water companys rich. theyre not expensive, its like 3 bucks for one of those big packs at shaws. that will keep you un-thirsty for a couple weeks for pocket change.
986	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would lose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottles everyday so, banning them would only hurt big corporations. http://www.nestlewaterscorporate.com/bottled_water_things_to_know/
987	God created water bottles for a reason, because its useful.
988	plastic water bottles all day every day, without those we could comfortably walk around the block with a safe suply of water in our hands
989	I like this website but I don't find it very clear. This one is better : theworlddebating.com
990	Here is a reason why gay marriage could be wrong. If gay marriage is ok, then sister and brother marriage is ok too? Whats the difference? Oh wait, the sex is the difference, so SISTER and SISTER or BROTHER and BROTHER is ok... right?
991	India surely has the potential to lead the world.........Dr Manmohan Singh is considered as the most qualified prime minister all over the world.........India has proved its potential in various fields and aspects............
992	I'd like to point out how few disputes there are on the Christian side, that's cuz free minded people dont need to convince other's. We know that there isn't a god, and that its up to us to make our lives.
993	For reasons that should be totally obvious, and which I would assume have been thoroughly worked out by others involved.
994	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen. It's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.
995	It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child
996	Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side. Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?
997	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
998	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals. For instance, I wouldn't want my child to hit me.
999	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1000	Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and then one night that you least expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
1001	Not to be glib, but are you stating that we should look to the government to provide us with our belief system. Have you ever read T. Hobbes...?
1002	There is only one situation in which I believe abortion is okay. If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, then I believe abortion is sad, but necessary. Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
1003	i do not see any difference in killing an embroyo or a 40 year old person. murder....is murder
1004	My one question... Why is it we argue for the "right" to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?
1005	Well "The Champ" It is not the Woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible dont let a new life die for it!
1006	Besides only a few people apply physical exercises in their daily life!
1007	a PE teachers job must be really easy, they dont need to learn anything, all they have to do is shout at kids for an hour.
1008	Gym class is a class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
1009	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.
1010	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."
1011	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on top. I know I want to be a "winner". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.
1012	I believe it is more important to have a personal pursuit because if you even want to begin to help others you have to help yourself. It's not bad to want to help the common good but if you're always putting other people before yourself you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. But I do think that you can have a balance of both.
1013	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for yourself, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own personal quest for happiness.
1014	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city. But only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
1015	I believe that personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. If you cant focus on yourself personally how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that its better to focus on yourself.
1016	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve yourself for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are no different nor are they the same but they are significant.
1017	a number of reasons.. because the girls are out looking for a good time with guys in perhaps the wrong places--ie the bar or disco or late night parties because guys are "lacing" drinks with drugs quite easily because the media portrays "a good time" for young people as" having sex" and uncool to go without it because girls dont think their safety is their priority anymore and if parents try to warn them they react by going all out with guys giving them the opportunity they are looking for because the "safety antena" of girls arent as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victim thus date rape is a consequence of all these factors. so girls need to take care, be aware of their own safety dont give "strange" guys the upperhand if they dont want to be date raped.
1018	The conversation can not be used as evidence in a court of law. I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama. Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it. Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types. They will suck you dry.
1019	No, they can't force you to however, it may impair your credibility so you can instead make an affirmation. I do not "believe in god" either, I also will not swear an oath to any state or government either. Many legal documents require a notary seal, I refuse their oath so, instead i make only a documented affirmation, it works and is completely legal.(saves on notary fees to boot)
1020	the executor of the estate is supposed to divie up the remains equally, i think; and that means for everything that is sold you get an equal share. if they sold it, it doesnt matter if they already spent their portion of what they got, they still owe you your share. you can sue them. its a shame people act so selfishly and unethical towards each other when their parent dies.
1021	Purpose of punishment is to reform the criminals but in some cases 1. person is beyond the process of reformation and he starts enjoying his criminal acts such as serial killers, psychopath and 2. in some other grave cases the convict has done such a heinous crime that conscience of a ordinary person is shaken and to deter others from doing similar acts capital punishment is needed. 3. even law commission in its various reports has recommended not to ban it specially in Indian system. 4. further such a punishment is given in keeping the norms of the society in mind and in a least cruel manner i.e. by hanging so, i feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
1022	Driving requires a persons 100% attention. While using a cell phone your attention is diverted into dialing a number and it's always best to have 2 hands on the steering wheel. Please avoid using your cell phone while driving. Although there may be no law in your state, it's always best to set an example. I have had my fair share of drivers who were not paying attention cause they were on their cell phone.
1023	First of all, the ACLU would have nothing to do with this case. They generally only take cases involving the government infringing on people's civil liberties. Second of all, where's your source for this case? You have a few specific details, so surely you must have some news story or a link of some kind to more information? I have a hard time believing your statement. Third of all, the answer to your question is "no."
1024	Don't you mean the NY Times? At least they happen to be the paper that the Bush Admin. is targeting. Although the Gov. has a web site, and a magazine dedicated to this very issue! Not to mention all the other media organizations that printed the same story... What a scam! Bush himself has made over a dozen public statements, since 9/11, mentioning how they are disrupting "terrorist" funding!!! Just another Bush Admin. tactic to distort and distract!
1025	NO. Whoever made the first'response' is a prime example of how powerful propaganda is. I don't ever remember hearing of a VALID case that had anything to do with the use of marijuana and someone being violent, much less some killing spree. Regardless of what the government provides as services for those who are ill, it shouldn't have the right to totally ban the use of certain substances. ESPECIALLY when those substances are LESS harmful than the ones that are legal! Wake up guys! NEWSFLASH: You can die by drinking too much water! Just because you'll get help from a hospital or whatever doesn't mean they should ban water. Where is your logic, guys? Also to those who whine about it being a gateway drug: If it wasn't illegal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug. It's made bad only by the hypocritical efforts of the government and the gullible people that trust their efforts.
1026	Looks like you're afraid of him having rights to raise this child should you die. If you don't want him to have rights to is child, you'll need to get him to sign a legal document signing his rights away. Of course if he does sign his rights away he won't be liable for child support. Check with your local social services office & ask them... "If he signs away his rights to this child will /can the back child support still be collected?"... Yes, do bring him forth & establish paternity.
1027	Even when the sentence was unreasonable to begin with? Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram. And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in as long as she was.
1028	Were YOU eligible for unemployment? If not then you've committed FRAUD. This can be a felony in most states. I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you. They will notice this and catch on to it. Today in most states employeers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws. This will be a way for them to catch you. The other main way is with your taxes. When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands and/or your name.
1029	i don't know where you're getting the idea they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care. it COSTS the state tons of money. my sister does this for a living and their departements are severly underfunded and understaffed. the workers do what they can but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officals that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads the situation is not going to improve. it's really sad. my sister alone has about 50 cases and she's sposued to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least 1 visit and go to court monthly for each of them. there's just not enough hours in a day. each caseworker should only have about 20 cases but they don't have the funding to hire enough people. i hope your situation works out.
1030	I'm not sure I exactly understand the supposition you're making. In general, however, I would argue that moral and legal can be viewed as a Venn diagram - an act can be both, one of the other, or neither. We probably wouldn't want it any other way, actually - hence the saying that "you can't legislate morality."
1031	I don't know - I always call my electrician to help fix my plumbing. Perhaps the defense lawyer is more of a general practice attorney that works on many different kinds of cases. Or, perhaps he (or your husband) is an idiot. Worst case scenario - he's trying to save the ability to claim inadequate representation if you kick him around in court.
1032	I'm not an American, I'm Canadian and very proud of that fact. There are things I admire and envy about the USA, but then on the other side there are also things I do not appreciate or admire. This war in Iraq is one of them... I think it was a huge mistake to go in and do what they have done. The civilian casualties are such a shame!
1033	If you live in Michigan they will. Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking.
1034	You can't say what you want?????? Okay, I could understand not being able to criminally threaten someone or attempt to intimidate them, but other than that you should be able to express yourself. Man, I am sorry to hear the UK is going down such an ugly path. As for where to draw the line on rights and liberties, I believe the right to swing my arm stops a few inches from your face. I believe that you have the right to say what you want UNLESS it endangers someone else---for example no yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater and no soliciting murder. Laws about what passes your lips can't achieve the real goal of the folks who write the laws: stopping ugly thoughts.
1035	Depends on what you're going for and the impression you want to make. If you want to give the impression that you're a fine up-standing citizen who should be let off the hook, then I'd go with none of the above and choose something more traditional. If you don't care about the impression you're making, then go with the Birks, clearly.
1036	Civil rights- we are innocent until proved guilty, and having everyone on a database would be taking the opposite stance- like, 'you are a criminal waiting to step out of line'- that could even have a reverse effect- like, 'they reckon I'm a criminal already, so why not do crime?' We still have the right to privacy to an extent, and having all our details on a database, microchipping us when we haven't done anything wrong, that be a huge violation of personal rights. Still, the biometric ID card will be similar to the system you are suggesting. We'll see if the crime rate goes down... Even if you have everyone on a database, who will monitor the people who monitor the database?
1037	I think people sent to prison for drug abuse should be in rehab centers. Note, that's drug abuse, not selling drugs. Drug dealers should have prison time, but the punishment should fit the circumstances. If the drug abuser commits crimes to feed his/her addiction, then jail time for the criminal activity, followed by rehab for the drug abuse. As for murderers and rapists, I think the sentencing needs to be harsher. And capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.
1038	It's not legal because it can't be regulated by the government, because it's generally regarded as a gateway drug (one that leads to other, more dangerous drug use), and because, since it hasn't always been legal like in some European countries, legalizing it would not only lead to a massive initial interest in it, but also cause increased health care costs (don't front; it damages respiratory systems and impairs judgment) and decrease labor quality-- and all those drug dealers who sold weed would need to find something else to do, and my guess is it wouldn't be a legit job-- so it'd also cause a spike in crime; probably gun sale, or increased trafficking in worse narcotics. It's a bad idea.
1039	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other? If it involves a good looking woman and a male minor then its good If its a guy and a girl minor then its bad If its two minors together than the laws should be less harsh than they are now A good example would be when a good teacher get in jail for doing it with a male student. For what? Making him one of the luckiest guys alive?
1040	If everything is in order between you and your mother, I see no reason why you couldn't venture off on your own! Check the local laws and statues in your town. Usually 18 is the adult age, but there are exceptions to the laws in some areas. If you go live with a relative and you are "underage", then a guardianship contract would have to be amended by both parties, your parents and your live-in relatives or adult-head of house. But I really don't think they will make a big thing out of just being one year away from adulthood for you, or anyone else, anywhere! I say, just pack your bags, and with your mom's blessing, go off and find your destiny my child! Have fun and stay out of trouble, ok?
1041	Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off... I favor harvesting of stem cells from donated cord blood and see no reason at all why embryonic cells are needed at all in order to do the research that holds such incredible promise.
1042	i think to make murder punishable by murder is a joke, what is the difference between the criminal and the law if both are commiting murder. also if i were facing life in prison i would much prefer the death penalty and im sure many people on death row see it that way, fortunatly in my country we abolished the death penalty long ago and now killers have to live with their nightmares for the rest of their lives rather than getting an easy way out. we are supposed to be promoting modern liberal western values to the rest of the world but it is not very good when the wests leading nation itself cannot follow these ideals
1043	Is this a question, or a US bashing, I'm not sure. I often ask myself that same question though. The most honest answer might be because we can control our technology, and we have the power to control proliferation too because we see it as a danger. In general, it's probobly not a good idea for every Tom, Dick, and Harry to have Atom bombs. Do you really think nothing bad would happen if every country had enough bombs to destroy the planet? Yea that would be swell. I do have to admit there is a certain irony to the United States being so controlling about nukes. We say we can't trust others to have them, but who's the ONLY country crazy enough in the history of the world to actually use one... Yep.
1044	Go out and join law enforcement. If you have the education and the training, you should do fine. However, be aware that the people who you will deal with are living a different reality than you and I. They operate on the law of the jungle. The strong survive and power means everything.
1045	i knw its a cliche' but NO OFFENSE TO U!!!..... u 'think' that india is poor,,,but its not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1046	Without going into great detail, if you listen they say "You have the RIGHT to remain silent" It's just the fact that it's their right to not have to say anything. And when you are being questioned you aren't always a criminal, remember you must be proven guilty, but you are first innocent. At the time when they are questioning them they are suspects. Also i'm sure if a suspect didn't want to talk, but was forced to do so, they would make up a lot of junk and waste the polic officers time anyways
1047	If the person is mentally handicapped and can prove it-(Doctor supported diagnosis) then I don't suppose the person should be prosecuted. BUT, if someone is supposed to be taking care of or has guardianship of the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. I also think HUNGER is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue. If it isn't, it should be.
1048	No, you are using the equipment provided for you as an employee, and the school has the right to ensure that it is NOT being used for any illegal purpose. If you don't like the terms of the contract you sign so that you can use school computers for e mails, then you should just stop using them. They will also monitor the web sites you, or any of the pupils, visit.
1049	Because we are not taught from a young age to respect alchohol. If we treated it more like Europeans it would not be considered taboo. Thats why so many teenagers have to drink till they get sick and act like twits. Also those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You aint sexy when you get drunk. Backwards is alcohol thinking in America.
1050	I say 18 if you ask me, yeah its still young i guess, but by that time, you should be finishing up H.S and have lived under parents law long enough. Just like you said, you can go fight wars and vote, thats a big responsibility right there. If you old enough to (die) and old enough to vote. then I think the legal age should be 18.. As far as drinking, let be real, if someone under age wants to drink they can get liq, its not that hard..
1051	No, he's already way over his head in California. Besides, we have a president right now who is not really up to the challenges of presidency - and I really don't want to repeat that again. Plus, I think that a president of his country should be born here. Any other job can go to anyone else with legal status - but not the presidency.
1052	I certainly don't fear "the competition"...Besides the fact that my husband gets it good at home, most of the prostitutes I've seen are FAR from "very hot chick"...Most of them are drug addicted skanks who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized they could make money off their own sex. Personally, I believe that it should be legalized, as this removes much of the mystique and sordidness from the whole situation. Also, in most places where it's legal, they're tested for diseases on a regular basis, which obviously solves a major problem.
1053	I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty, amongst other benefits. * The state's hands are kept clean. * An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents. * The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider is important. * If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an "out". * The method of suicide should be left up to the convict. * No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.
1054	We're born, we live, we die. These are the constants in our life. We know that these things are going to happen. So what is the point of being motivated to do anything? Why should I work a job that I have no interest in? Why should I bother to keep in touch with people? I am in a position right now where I am between jobs, and in a general transition phase of my life. Dealing with societal strife is meaningless. I should just withdraw from society and live out my days surrounded by cats or something. CMV.
1055	"Be yourself" attitude hurts people who have it, and everybody around them as well. It's an excuse for doing all sorts of stupid shit and not improving yourself. We, as a civilization, have progressed so much by striving for the better, striving for perfection and doing everything to make lives of their descendants as good as possible. People are glorifying all kinds of objectively bad things (morbid obesity, being an asshole to other people, ana/mia, heavy drug addiction) under parole of "that is who I am and you have no right to judge me"
1056	Today I opened the door for a girl and got screamed at, at 8 in the morning. Certainly changes need to be made but not in the way it's being approached now. I don't think I've heard one coherent argument. Again, I completely support equality but the beating down of every make you come across surely isn't the best way to accomplish things. It's not like I don't support the movement, I just don't fully understand it (in terms of how the goal is being achieved). And every person I've come across supporting it has been mean spirited and a bit of an asshole I guess what I'm really looking for is proof of what progress is being made recently, or how the aggressiveness pays off. Thanks in advance for any light that can be shed.
1057	You have no control over what city or country you're from like you have no control over what colour your skin is. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they're from and not how they play.
1058	It has become increasingly clear that the country doesn't work for the betterment of its citizenry and I don't see it moving in the direction of ever reaching some sort of an equilibrium in which it does. The culture there just continue to go in the wrong directly of idolization and total submission and people become more and more programmed to accept that with generations. People are working and are barely able to sustain themselves. I believe the two countries should be united and South Korean system should be accepted. This coming from a pinko commie is a difficult thing to state but I think this would be the better outcome than continuing the way it is going. How this is to happen is not really a concern of the topic posted.
1059	Surely the whole #bringbackourgirls is self defeating. This isn't to say I don't support the sentiment and i do think it's a truly heinous situation, but it doesn't make sense. I feel ultimately iy paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror and to a degree supports/promotes its style by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists without having an actual force to change anything. Whilst there are always going to be smug campaigns which are more about feeling better from doing some armchair activism than true will to change, i do think that a lot of people will feel this particular campaign has a lot of merit so that it keeps it in the social conscience. I just don't think it works this time for the reason above.
1060	I think we should put research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general.. It would disintegrate before it even arrived at the sun.. Perhaps we would be able to do it once or twice a year where we could be certain it would land. But maybe we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earths escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldnt burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1061	_____ I know that with science most people are now able to have children but i feel it is just selfish. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for adoption and to spend what is over $3000 just to get a surrogate doesn't sit right with me. Also the most successful surrogate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little in order to use their bodies. Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking so knowing that a woman went throght that just to give birth to a child she will never see again doesn't seem right.
1062	Polyamory has been popping up in the media a lot recently and I tend to read the comments on these articles. They do not tend to be, on the whole, positive, with people just tending towards "Nope" or "Ick" type comments. I'm in a polyamorous relationship with two men, so I've got a dog in this fight. We live together. They're not in a sexual relationship with each other. We are happy, healthy, stable and long-term. Tell me, what is objectively wrong with my relationships? And yes, yes, I know it's not for everyone; that's not an argument in itself.
1063	All of my grandparents were born somewhere from the late 1920's to the end of the 1930's and according to most of what I've heard marriage was just "something they did". Society, for whatever reason, just expected them to get married young and have lots of children.
1064	I personally feel that the amount of money they're being paid is too much. Now I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it. Yes, this may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.
1065	This is partly inspired by the "new look" Ronald McDonald that was unveiled on Twitter recently.
1066	_____ I'm an Australian, and I love watching any sport, even the Winter Olympics. However, I cannot understand the massive following for Baseball and American Football. I've tried to sit through full games, but I find there is a severe lack of fluency and action in both sports. I feel like that I am missing or not appreciating something about these sports, and that if I was made aware of some uncovered aspects then I would enjoy them a lot more. Are these sports really that exciting? Or is it more that they have been ingrained in the American culture so much so that the attractiveness and appeal of the actual game is an after thought? Please change my view, as I would love to get involved.
1067	I never tip, I think it reinforces the notion that employers can get away with paying a sub standard wage to people based on their chosen occupation, I think tipping should be abolished and in it's place employers should be legally obligated to pay a realistic and survivable wage then if people decide to tip then it should go directly to the server. I've never understood why employers are allowed to pay 2$ an hour and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage, and I don't feel anyone should be guilted into paying X% on top of the bill at a restaurant to pay the servers wage wen it should be their employers
1068	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. I've been in this region my entire life, and even though we took a battering economically, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area, since it's nothing more than God's waiting room. Too many sticks in the mud, you know? Tourism is an economic driver, bit it shouldn't be the only one. For the love of Pete, change my view before 2015! That may be my opportunity to hop off to Tampa Bay should I have the means to do so.
1069	Many communities (e.g. Less Wrong, MIRI) and books (Our final invention) have popped up in the last few years attempting to combat a potential AI doomsday scenario. I'm not talking about robots taking jobs or military AI systems gunning people down. I mean Bostrom's paper clip machine scenarios. Anyway, I do not think this kind of universal optimizer is the trend in AI research. To me it seems the focus (with deep learning etc) is on imitating the cortex's memory system and building really powerful classifiers. I'm not saying we shouldn't theorize potential disaster, but I think the current fear is overblown CMV
1070	Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but it has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If I smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.
1071	Sure, some brand styling choices could be understood, but in almost 40 years we have figured out what a general purpose all-around video game controller should be. 2 thumbsticks, four thumb buttons on the right, an 8-way directional pad on the left, two bumper buttons, and two triggers. So why the different placement of the directional pad and left stick for Microsoft and Sony when the controllers are functionally identical in every other way? I think there is a superior layout, (which one I think it is, is irrelevant) and one of the companies simply can't budge because of stubbornness.
1072	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art". But hasn't almost all installation art since then been Duchamp's Fountain over and over again. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc. Almost all contemporary installation art is criminally dull and boring. The 100th attempt at asking the question 'what is art' just leaves me dripping with apathy. The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh as people walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, it's the opposite. They're proudly put on display. I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
1073	First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest. That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).
1074	The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed.
1075	* Nobody should take a drug they dont understand the effects of, and removing drug stigma is the first step to increasing peoples education on the subject. * Nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring LSD or MDMA. Addictive drugs should be considered more akin to tobacco: Definitely a bad habit to start, and generally not worth trying at all. * Everybody should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges. * Everybody should be able to buy govt approved, pure drugs and know what they're taking. * Everybody knows the war on drugs is a failure. Its fine if you dont think people should be able to do drugs but you cant say your solution is prohibition but I know a guy who can get me some pot who knows a guy who can get me some acid who knows a guy who can get me some meth. Squares would not believe how easy it actually is to buy hard drugs.
1076	This is in relation to the most recent Indian election in which the Hindu Nationalist Narendra Modi won in a landslide. I can see nothing good in Narendra Modi in the long term. Although it may be true that he has a good economic record in Gujarat he will destroy the religious toleration for which India is famed. It would be far better to retain Congress, who although they are as corrupt as all hell are not responsible for the massacre of Muslim Pilgrims (the 2002 Gujarat riots where up to 2000 Muslim pilgrims were massacred and Modi was accused of complicity). Aside from this specific instance, is it better to be tolerant and corrupt than effective and intolerant in the abstract?
1077	I think that could be a contributing factor. Plus, our media doesn’t show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. And the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc.
1078	I did not create this topic, but I would support the decriminalization of marijuana as long as it would still be illegal to sell or advertise it to minors and as long as it is not used while operating automobiles/heavy machinery. There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana: 1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the workforce. 2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system. 3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are. Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market. I know people mean well by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs), but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.
1079	Yes. It is safer than alcohol, its nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed) and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (like they do with weed houses) that could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When Prohibition was removed, organization returned to society as well.
1080	There's really no debate here, but no one checks the forums and i want this to get some attention. This website has become a stagnant waste. There is almost no intellectual stimulation anymore. The lack of quality debates is almost smothered by the lack of general participation. Its been weeks since i learned something or read something worthwhile here and that really needs to change. So i'm going to make an effort to have a plethora of debates (about 5 a week) and they'll start with W.U.C (Wake Up Convinceme) and they'll cover a range of political, social, and moral issues that i feel are stimulating and not discussed enough to maybe bring this website back. Wake Up Convinceme!
1081	This debate isn't about whether kids should eat candy, but whether governments should ban ads for kids that portray candy-eating as good.
1082	Hitler invaded Poland in 1932 and the world turned against Germany. In fact, there are dozens if cases in the last 100 years where countries have invaded other nations and the world has caused uproar and rose up against it. Yet some Texan does it and gets away with it. Try him for war crimes, along with Tony Blair and have them both executed or imprisoned.
1083	Truth be told, truth is different for each and everyone of us. For example my truth is that when I flush the toliet the water goes counter clockwise, but for someone in Brazil their truth is it goes clockwise. Who is right, well in a sense we both are, scenarios define truths. Then again I could give the typical Christian answer and say Jesus is truth, The Way, the Truth, and the Life.
1084	In the NFL it is safe to say that not every position that is played is created equal. Kickers aren't paid as much as running backs and running backs aren't paid as much as quarterbacks.
1085	I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill goes and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.
1086	Let me start by defining what Wrestling should be: Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two unarmed persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other. Are we seeing this on television? No! The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats etc as weapons which means that they are harmed! The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, i can remember clearly the'UNDERTAKER' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a terrible sight!.....
1087	We all know that guys just want to get some ass to impress their friends and show off that they got some...soon after the guy will leave the girl after he bangs her and goes off to someone else and so on. But when it comes down to it, guys pressure their girl to have sex when they aren't ready and if the guy wants it really bad he'l break up with the girl and go out with someone that will give him some so he can feel sastified and that doesn't make any girl feel confident about themselves and it makes the guy a low selfish asshole.
1088	We should not have to pay for education as it is vital for society to function. If people are unable to afford the price of education there are consequences that will occur; such as many children's futures will disintegrate. Education is what gives people the power to achieve goals and successfullness; What right has anyone got to refuse to educate someone simply because they are unable to provide the funds required?
1089	Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Unless I'm missing something Heaven, and Earth are still in existance, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happend. I open with these words from the Messiah Yahushua himself, and take him at his word as he is no liar. I realize my post is not in a question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed...The Torah/Law is forever!
1090	Actually this is a good thing for the economy in the long run. China has been keeping its currency really low so that it can continue to provide really cheap goods to the US. If the dollar gets low enough in comparison however, Chinese goods will become more expense hurting American consumers in the short term but ultimately strengthening the domestic market for US producers. But it will get worse before it gets better.
1091	Went here for dinner on my last night in Montreal over the summer. It seemed to be pretty popular, and was packed on this particular night. We got a table and got to ordering. Pricing is tricky, as sometimes the things you order and get doesn't show up, but there's a fixed charge on your bill. It would be better to see individually, but since it's all-you-can-eat, it's only one. Plus, this night, there was a lot of wrong orders. Things that one table ordered went to another table and vice versa. Sushi was good though, but I felt like they charged us more than what we got and ordered.
1092	Finally! The new space is phenomenal, and we didn't think the food could get any better, but....It did! Had the rib taco and the brisket taco - outstanding. Also had the slaw and the black beans, so fresh and tasty. They know how to cook. Really. Thanks. You may want to call ahead for a reservation - it gets packed!
1093	We really enjoyed the food and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be going back to Zeta's again. We went for lunch. I had the meat shawarma pita and my husband had the gyro. We swapped bites and both were great! They serve pita bread and olive oil at the beginning. It was very good! Definitely homemade pita bread. We were on and out in about 30 minutes over the lunch hour.
1094	I'm not really sure why this place has been poorly rated as I was very impressed with the food, drinks and the patio! I found the service to be a little slow but I like that at times, not feeling rushed to turn our table over as quickly as possible. The nachos were delicious and my fish tacos were full of flavour and authentic tasting. The Caesar was one of the best I've ever had! I think the restaurant started off a bit slow and rough when they opened which probably led to the poor reviews but trust me when I say this, give it a go! The prices are on point, the menu has great options and the atmosphere is a perfect summer's night out!
1095	If there is zero star can be chose, I'll go with that one. Went there at 10/20/2013 around 6pm with group of 6. Ordered hummus as appetizer. Main entrees are potato pizza, LOBSTER GNOCCHI, ROASTED CHICKEN and burgers. 3 of us ended up having diarrhea in the middle of the night. Some came with the feeling of puking. 1 of us have acid reflex and lots of gas disturbing the whole night. Other 2 have some gas problem. Don't know what's going on with the food that evening but will definitely not going back again.
1096	There's not much else in Mesa for wine bars and D'Vine has always been a nice refuge when wanting to stay in town. Right around the corner for me and saves driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale. Food has always been tasty and the staff friendly each time we've come in. Nice ambiance and the live music has been great so far. Only wish is they'd stay open a little later on the weekends for us night owls. 11PM would be perfect.
1097	I am obsessed with this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. We tend to forget about it a little bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food never disappoints. Chicken. On point. Beef. On fleek. Rice, beans, PLANTAINS? God, stop it. So good. My only disappointment was that I tried dessert and had what I thought was a tres leches cake and it didn't taste like what I thought it would? Maybe I'm used to an over sugarized American version of it :)
1098	If you have lots of time to spare waiting for an ok burger, then this place is for you! 25 minutes to get served a burger is just way too long. I have wasted my time, money and yes, precious calories on this place! I wish that I would have gone to McDonalds and either have the same experience, if not better. Now, I'm just enjoying a fresh bowl of salad. Thanks to the extra calories that I sacrificed for nothing. Boo!!! It's amazing how this place is still getting a very high rating.
1099	I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?! Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointless. :/ OH AND. Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
1100	FireFox Is The Best! I Know Because I Have It! The Only Reason More People Use IE Is Becuse It Is the Default Browser For most Comps. I Bet 90% Of The IE Supporters have only known that single browser.
1101	If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.
1102	I dont think i could turn my spouse in, or my family and friends if they committed a murder because those people are way to close to me and i couldnt picture my life without any of them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, i think that is wrong, especially if you live with the person.
1103	I say books are better because It has you use your imagination so the more you read the more your imagination improves and It helps you to improve reading, grammar, and it improves your writing skills!!! Also I want to say I hate commercials!!! I hate Spongebob!!! I would say PBS Kids, history channel, and the other Channels that help kids or adults get smarter I would say are good!
1104	books even reduce our electricity bills! which can use much of our spending money
1105	books make you more intelligent, because they can also say what people are thinking.
1106	some ppl cant read is absolutely idiotic to say the ppl who cant read wud always run away from them bt even den B for books nd B for best so books r da best i cant sleep if i wont read a chapter from any novel each day bt actually sometimes i feel reading books all day becomes boring (in schools textbooks nd at home novels) so only sometimes i watch tv nd that 2 news channels hence by reading books i can even pass my time nd even improve my speaking skills
1107	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation could lead the whole world. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. India doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people.
1108	Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
1109	A father is someone that is always there for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of your baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.
1110	This is just my opinion, but I think it would be better to be fatherless than to have a bad father. I mean i was always taught that a true man should be someone respectable, honest, nd hard working, if he's not a that kind of man then he doesn't deserve to be a father in the first place. Besides just because you don't have a father that doesn't mean you can't have aa father figure in your life.
1111	I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that isn't good? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad isn't good then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out of the house a never come back.
1112	Raffles founded Singapore and Farquhar was just a subordinate for Raffles. So it was normal that Raffles gave he duty of turning Singapore into a successful city and left the city to Farquhar to manage.
1113	well, the people who watch porn, i guess thats ok, its NORMAL. but the people who are in the porn, that is not normal. i read it in a abnormal psychology book, that means they have a disorder
1114	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.
1115	I think it's wrong, It goes against women rights and those girls are under aged and abused. It's also really sick in a way, what freak would film people having sex?! I don't understand it. I don't see what's so good about it, if you want sexual entertainment, masturbate or something.
1116	PORN iS WRONG WHY WOULD YOU WATCH PEOPLE DO SEX!! MAYBE EVERYONE FEEL DIFFERENT BUT STILL IF U WANNA WATCH PEOPLE DO SEX GET A MIRROR AND HAVE SEX AND LOOK AT YUR SELF...CUZ KIDS OUT HERE R WATCHIN IT AND DOIN THE WRONG THINGS!
1117	jarman: porn is wrong because it should be in 4-D with surround sound and special effects :) it would make it much more pleasurable btw im a girl..........
1118	Then according to your theory the fruit flies would have adapted and survived. So I'm not really sure how that argument works...
1119	* If evolution is true, then how come people aren't still evolving?
1120	Actually you must know nothing about debate because what I am doing is called "Cross Examining" and it is a very common tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position Also, Calling names never won a debate You just can't answer my questions and I'm sure that is frustrating for you
1121	1. why is creation not science? 2. why is this classified under the religion category? 3. do you disillusioned people think you look like monkeys?
1122	Hey IE has the best virus interface in the world, so why shouldn't you welcome those little cute viruses by sticking with the M$ IE?
1123	Some say FF loads faster than IE, but 9 times out of 10, someone who had just installed FF will experience slower program load times than loading up IE.
1124	Its an indisputable fact that the average IE user gets laid 2500% more than the average firefox user. sorry firefox losers... game set match go cry about IE somewhere else 8*(
1125	if physical educations r not ter then u wud b a couch potato howzz tat???
1126	There were a lot of pests at that time, and the people were suffering from them. However, Raffles wasn't around, and William had to think of a solution himself.
1127	Even though William had legalized gambling, he did it so that Singapore can prosper, but Raffles had turned it down, leaving Singapore alone.
1128	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort.
1129	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas, which would or would not work. However, actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas.
1130	Farquhar was exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.
1131	I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child, but I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered human. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have equal rights to a cow.
1132	people can make the choice for themselves. it is not up to us or the government to decide to add more children to this world.
1133	Here's a story for you from a few years ago. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.
1134	Abortion is ok because a fetus isn't a human. To be human, you must have both the following criteria (IMO) You must be human (homo sapiens) You must be able to contribute to society. By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.
1135	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
1136	all i have to say on this issue is that there is evidence to support evolution!!
1137	What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? Why would God have to change anything. He created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.
1138	How come people aren't still evolving? How are you so sure we are not? Could you please show some evidence that we are NOT evolving? And dont say, because we would notice if we were. Solid, verifiable evidence if your key to proving your point.
1139	me and my wife share an exciting and passionate love life. we love the porn. we pop it on and use it to set the room on fire. for us itt is a way to share and expand the love we enjoy together in the bedroom. so as long as it is legal and everyone is of age then there should be no problem.
1140	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But then you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching others what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. Therefore you let others take it to the next level.
1141	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
1142	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.
1143	Advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. But, of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.
1144	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe. If you want change you would do change to yourself.
1145	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you. For example, if you improve the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.
1146	Good idea for separate student from other people for at least increase garment job. Why do we use soldier uniform? For separate from civil. Why do terrorist not use soldier uniform? For harmonious with civil and easy to attack enemy.
1147	school uniform does no harm to students life emotions now as for the point of expressing oneself imagine one bully wearing shirt,tie,pant all neatly ironed and well polished shoes wont he look good.remember dressing sense also is a part of ur interveiw
1148	I think it would be better to have a bad father because atleast you have someone there. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a bad father is better than no father.
1149	I believe it is better to have a bad father than none. It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A bad father is not that bad because what exactly makes a bad father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.
1150	It's better to have a bad father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think I need it. He wouldn't care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. But that's just my opinion. Because that kind of father is still bad because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.
1151	I don't ever wanna be here Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare If it falls apart I would surely wake it Bright lights turn me clean This is more than it seems
1152	I think TV is better if you are watching an informational channel and it is better than books because you can switch to different informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a funny show or whatever you want to watch.
1153	If you can only understand or speak a specific language but you move to another country then most of the books are not in your language but TV comes in all different languages and you can also hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
1154	Same sex marriage can cause a lot of contriverse, it puts peoples life at risk in extrem cases gay marriage has caused so much trouble pepole has resulted in murder and sucied
1155	i remember the only country by whose fear alexander's army was afraid it was india after just sixty years of independence india is looked as the country to become the sixth member of security council of UN and it is also the country with a great development rate and i know that none of us are unknown to the great contribution of india in the discovery of god partical then from where the matter comes from that india is not having the pottential
1156	Of course India has the POTENTIAL to lead the world, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. They have the knowledge, the manpower, and the resources to lead the world.
1157	we have scientific evidence that the flood of noah could not have happened. THINK ABOUT THIS : IF THE FLOOD OF NOAH HAD HAPPENED, WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND THE REMAINS OF LONG DEAD ANIMALS AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT WE DO NOT FIND THIS AT ALL.
1158	Honestly, I Think It's better to try a different option besides spanking that can affect a child's way of thinking and may get depressed
1159	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.
1160	There's some parents that spank their children for every little thing, and that is not right. As a result, their children will always be scared of them.
1161	Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although, it may sometimes seem necessary to spank your children, in my opinion it should always be the last resort.
1162	Yes I would. Nobody should get away with murder. But that I would never marrie somebody that would murder someone. But that's beside the point.
1163	If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same, it would change because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.
1164	If my husband kills someone I will turn him in, because is a crime and for every act, I have learn that there is a consequence for everything. And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
1165	I would definetly turn her in. No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I rather prefer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.
1166	Don't kid yourself: the vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone whenever they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
1167	OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real education. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups
1168	I don't care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same rights that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it- gays NEED to be recognized on that level. Not allowing this is a violation to the constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is...
1169	There is an argument of people saying is gay marriage acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love. Because how come we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman as gay sexuality. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like!!
1170	First of all, gays have the fundamental right of equal happiness. Second of all, they are still part of society. Third of all, the government would have a better image if we allowed the third gender to have the equal right of marriage. Also, it only proves that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent.
1171	Religion, lifestyle etc is a personal choice. If your religion or culture disallows gay marriage, that's fine. It means you don't want to marry a person of the same gender. But then why should it extend to other religions or cultures? Gay people marrying in no way affects your marriage to the opposite gender either, they simply get married and get on with it just like you do.
1172	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already successful and with money he decides to help others.
1173	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
1174	I don't think that he (an old man) killed his exwife and her friend. But this book (which is in extremely poor taste, damn offensive) is his attempt to convince an overhelming majority that he is innocent. I think he has lost his mind and since he lost his civil court case, the revenue from his book and other gain ventures should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
1175	1) It is protected by the first amendment of the Bill of Rights: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' -Speech also implies expression 2) Desecration of the U.S. flag so far is legal. Although recently (2005) the House passed a law making in illegal to desecrate the American flag. It is still awaiting further approval through our legal system.
1176	no you are not better off "always" to wear one. On the radio today it was saying in the US, @ 30,000 people die each year for not wearing thier seat belt. and about 10,000 die each year because they had it on. It is in my opinon a harm of my rights, but I can't afford the fine either,a nd they are getting tough on the fines lately
1177	There are Scientology schools, where most kids who were born into it go, but I have never heard of it being taught in public school. There are a number of front groups that do various things for the community, like Narconon and the like. These groups do not advertise that they are really Scientologists, so it is very possible that if you heard that Scientology was being taught in ____ school, it's definitely run by Scientologists.
1178	Yes. I work with a few different local police departments and I trust all of them. As for the city I live in, I do, very much. There are some great officers there and they are respectful and caring. They try and do the best they can for the community. The chief is great and backs his officers. We don't have a lot leave from there.
1179	The officer and the business owner have both CLEARLY violated your right to freedom of speech! I would IMMEDIATELY file a complaint with the U.S. Attorney Generals office, The F.B.I. and your local police chief, I would also contact every media outlet I could get my hands on with the detailed story. If you have the extra money lying around I would also file a civil suit against both the officer and the business owner. You have clearly been wronged, and don't even think about stepping down. FIGHT BACK. I've won 3 lawsuits against the police in my lifetime already, and I'm only 21 years old. We the people cannot stand for this outright ILLEGAL behavior by law enforcement. If you follow the proper measures, and take this thing to the "top of the hill" that officer will never work behind a badge again, and the business owner will be liable for so many damages to you he'll be put out of business.
1180	I say, sentence them to life in prison and put them in our worst supermax prison and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terrorist. I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves. Might not deter anyone, but what will?
1181	It happens all over the world, even bad countries aren't held accountable. Such as Israel for instance in its occupation of Palestinian lands since 1967. Israel was caught breaking the law (occupying another people's land) why is it that it was protected by the US (through Veto Power) and not militarily kicked out like any other normal country would have been? (eg. Iraq out of Kuwait etc.) So in conclusion, the proper answer would be that the world isn't fair and just because some people have GUNS and "protection", (like some states have BIG GUNS and "protection"), the law is lenient with them.
1182	If someone in my family had to be killed, I would want the person responsible to pay. And if it met going to the gas chamber or lethal injection then so be it. It may not bring that love one back, but I would have the satisfaction of knowing it could never go and do it to anyone else, he would be off the streets for good.
1183	Lets see Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945 which makes him DEAD. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006. Unless one of them can time travel its impossible for them to be the same person. I understand about the different sexual orientations. I may never get to level 4 by answering all these types of questions but its starting to get less boring see ya
1184	Regarding the property, if it's in your home, no one can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. Since it is unlikely the GP will falsify a police complaint, I wouldn't worry too much about the property. Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home or property without a warrant in the majority of cases, Exceptions for responding to calls from home and domestic violence. In the matter of the child, you really need to consult with a local attorney. There are too many variables for anyone to give you specific or accurate advice over the Internet. Good luck and hang in there.
1185	No, we wouldn't have to factor in the unwanted people if legs were kept closed and there plenty of people who want but can't have. If self control was practiced we would have a lot less trouble with this topic. There are the few that get raped and whatever the other excuses are but there is adoption for that and as for health...my child has a right to live more than I do...abortion isn't really great for a woman's health either ya know?
1186	If the minor is under 12 yrs old I'd say "NO" But at twelve I think your pretty aware of the things you are doing and the effects of them. And there have been a couple of murders in the U.S. that were very thought out, planned. and commited by tweleve and thirteen year olds. I think they should not only be tried as an adult But punished as one to.
1187	the liberal demacrates have made it ok to do all these things. If, in some way, drugs or alchahal became a band, they would IMMIDIATELY demand that the law is "unconstitutional". i heard that they took out the picture of George washington praying out of a school because they said that it was "unconstitutional". HES OUR FOUNDING FATHER! And they just took his picture out because they thought it was suggeting the christian values in the school. But they teach the kids about hinduism and judisum, but when it comes to christianity, ITS ILLEAGAL to teach the kids about that. And INstead of trying to keep kids out of sex, THEY ARE HANDING OUT CONDOMS, and trying to "encourge" the mto safe.
1188	First, my expertise. I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that did liquor license litigation. It's not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol. It would only be entrapment if the minor decoy used extraordinary means to convince the clerk to sell alcohol to him. The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors. If the decoy just says to the clerk, "Oh, come on!" and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime and it's not entrapment.
1189	No. There's a reason that you have to be an adult to serve on a jury. Teens, in general, don't possess the rational and mature thought necessary to make objective decisions based on the evidence, and tend to go more with what their emotions are telling them, which cannot be done in a court case. More life experience and maturity is required when making decisions that will affect someones entire life.
1190	If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a "bad" place, which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street. What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests. And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED (ie: innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn't make any sense at all.
1191	Oh please give it up and try to get something accomplished other than this useless pursuit. The chances of getting marijuanna legalized is slim...well at least the way things are going now. Banning smoking here and there, how things are cooked, what you can and can not say...we are in the "control your every way shape in mean for your own good" nanny state of mind now.
1192	Polygraphs use a baseline and go from there. If your friend was nervous from the start then that would be his baseline. I measure changes not overalls. The would have to be extreme for him to fail. Even if his English was not par it shouldn't have any effect. I know you want to stand by your friend so do what you think is right. Have him volunteer for another polygraph from a different reader.
1193	As contradictory as this statement may sound, I feel that affirmative action promotes reverse discrimination and is necessary in some cases. The biggest problem we are facing today is that the playing field (i.e. in the business world, college admissions, etc.) is not as leveled as some people may think. Sure, Black Americans (as well as other minorities) have come a long way from the old Jim Crow days, but there is a great amount of discrimination that still exists. Believe me, I wish that the policies didn't exist, but then again, that would only occur/work in a perfect, non-discriminatory world...
1194	Get a job. Your ex has a child or children to support. How do you expect them to do it and why should they carry your responsibility for it as well? GET A JOB! 
1195	What difference would there be? Violent career criminals will continue to be released back into society to make room for nonviolent first-time offenders like deadbeat dads (how do you pay child support in prison?), drunk drivers with multiple misdemeanor convictions (but no accidents), recreational marijuana users caught with a single joint in their possession, scam artists who prey on the wealthy, etc. Whoever builds them, prisons should be for the long-term incarceration of major drug dealers, robbers, rapists, and murderers in order to protect society from these violent sociopaths.
1196	First drugs are illegal so a punishment goes there. Under the use of drugs an act of crime occurs, may not have if accused was clean. Consider priors he/she may have. Then put together a jail term and a drug rehab program. I would suggest a 3 to 5 year sentence and less time for good behavior. Yes you are right about a killing being less time. That really stinks.
1197	What is their choice really? Either they do what China tells them or they offer nothing to the people there. There is no way for them to improve conditions for the people of China if the government blocks and removes them? Better to sacrafice and be seen then not sacrafice and be eliminated. People think there is censorship and a lack of privacy here; have no idea what freedoms they enjoy compared to the people of China.
1198	I agree with parts of both of the above answers. It has to do with a childs cognitive development. It is usually during those years children go from concrete to rational thinking. That is why some subjects are not taught until children are older. Some kids on the younger end don't know the difference between right and wrong in many cases. They can have a hard time to know what will happens, or consequence of what they do. Sixteen year olds are cognitively far ahead of a child who is 13 in every respect.
1199	Well, for one thing, Wal-Mart has one of the worst ratings in terms of how they treat their employees. I know people who boycott them and have encouraged me to do likewise. They are not like Costco at all. Why would Californians want to encourage a store to treat its people poorly? Why would they want to pay when the full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their bennies, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans (I'm assuming; I'm from NY)? Why would they want the related stress that comes with the anger and worthless feelings of being in such an environment so many hours a week? Why would they want them around at all?
1200	First off, you get what you pay for and secondly, if it seems to good to be true then it probably is. I would bump up to COMP and COLLISION as well. I would also ask the agent for a copy of the policy itself, called a specimen policy, and comb through it very carefully. It will spell out what you will and won't be getting in the policy. If you are comfortable then yes, go for it. Be advised, anything not covered by the policy in theory could be charged back to you. I work for an insurance company and have seen people lives ruined by not having enough or the RIGHT TYPE of insurance. Bad things do happen to good people. I hope this helps.
1201	Well, it's certainly not going away anytime soon, is it? In our society, you can give sex away for free, but you can't sell it. Yes, primarily it's for moral reasons. There are arguments made about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it now stands. Basically, I think it comes down to the fact that few people want society's "stamp of approval" on it. Would anyone want their daughter to consider it "just a job" or an easy way to get some quick cash? Or would they want their husbands to be able to find no-hassle sex whenever they had some extra cash? How about the thought of your father casually going to a brothel after work? Some might not have a problem with these ideas, but most people would feel otherwise.
1202	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty...i know if someone killed a family member i would want them to face the ultimate punishment. But the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe...it is not...not all cases involve DNA and those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. So oppose it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown amount of innocents sentenced to death.
1203	that depends.. I lost a friend a year ago to drugs.. very sad... Drug use in general is psychological thing... there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness... for example.. many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders... this is a good example of peer pressure.. nobody wants to hear about a grown man acting like a sissy?. society says.. "hell no.. lets go out and drink.." the problem with drug use is.. you are covering one problem with another... therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compuslion to use drugs... so yes. i believe in treatment... i believe you should help yourself... however.. one can only get treated if they are willing to accept help.. for repeat offenders.. i offer no sympathy..
1204	Yes. If you get caught later on, you'll get fired, and then you'll have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history. If you're going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired. Get a short term job, if necessary, and then find a better one. Be reliable especially at short-term jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference. Good luck.
1205	Ya know, public corporal punishment used to be executed in this country, the crime level was lower but there were also a lot less people living in the country. I am not sure that is a good idea, but something has to be done, the crime rate is out of control. What's sad I think is that corporal punishment might work, but it would be a media circus and then in turn be useless, there has to be a better answer!
1206	not really cause u didn't fill out an accident report and your work will argue u did it at home and u have not proof that u did it on the job did you tell anyone that your back was hurting before u left work and if you did they have to sign an affidavit that u did hurt yourself on the job and put their job in jeopardy and risk losing their job too so if u do hire a lawyer u better be ready to fight a long and powerful battle and nine times outta ten u lose so its best to goto the chiropractor keep your job and mark this up as a lesson the next time tell someone a couple hundred dollars is worth more losing your job and possibly getting black balled from gettin another cause when u fill out an app i don't care what anybody says your ex employer can black ball u and tell them what happened and u won't get the job
1207	Dear Friend, I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit. But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.
1208	It seems like it, but NO. No one is above the law. If he is a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau, and the city for code violations. If he does have the cops and law enforcement in his pocket (that is shameful!) there is not too much you can do. I would recommend staying away from him if at all possible. A BETTER IDEA: contact your local news agency. Expose him on national TV! They love to expose people like this. It's good for their ratings and it would cause him to stop (hopefully) or at least lose his business licence, etc.
1209	Can they sue you even if you are outside the US? Yes. Can they sue you even if they cannot find you? Yes. The court will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are. So, if you don't show up in thesuit you don't know about can they win a judgment? Yes. But now they have a judgment in a US court for US money. How will they enforce the judgment? If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the US, they can seize those. But if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought) it is going to be a nightmare for them to collect the money. I mean, they'll have to take the judgment to a foreign court and have it translated and it'll just be a mess. So you're probably safe. Not 100% definitely safe but about 87% pretty much safe.
1210	Race shouldn't even be a factor within a "diverse" community because irrespective of race everyone is still unique. Nobody should have to feel like they're just like everyone else because of their race. No two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Now, I'm not saying it's alright to purposely exclude members of different races, but they should not have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more "diverse". Moreover, even within a single race there are numerous differences in appearance and skin colour. Race really shouldn't matter that much.
1211	Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.
1212	I believe there is a stigma in society toward marijuana despite the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable. In fact, many scientists believe caffeine and maybe even sugar are more dangerous than marijuana. This societal "norm" is the only reason that marijuana is illegal, and not allowed for many employees even in states where it is legal (Colorado and Washington). Alcohol and tobacco have hugely negative effects on our society as a whole, but going out to get a drink, or just having some beers while watching the game, are some of the most common things done either to meet people or with people you're already friends with. CMV.
1213	We've all heard the saying "don't believe everything you see on the internet", which assumes that information gathered from other sources not online have a natural higher level of credibility. I disagree. I'm a true neutralist who believes that just because a propagandist had the money to spend to distribute their information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't give it any more credibility than typical things we see online. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, I just don't believe in that idea.
1214	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that probably their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but it doesn't matter. That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said, I don't want to see statistics about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how they are actually discriminated against.
1215	I know this is not true for all religions, there are many, but I'm mainly referring to Christianity and Islam (as they are the ones I know most about). I believe that morals should be like trading cards, you can swap them out whenever a better one comes along. I feel that religion keeps people stuck to the views set down in that religious text. I think that without religion people would be much more willing to accept new views as they come along. E.g. Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. People basing their moral views on thousand year old texts seems obscured to me. I am aware that there is room for interpretation but I think the world would be a better place if people made there own moral decisions instead of being prescribed them by their religion.
1216	My vote is for PROMOTING COMPLEX SELF-ORGANIZING MATTER as our ultimate purpose. CSOM is a rarity in this universe and it needs our help. We could shoot rockets to mars loaded with millions of types of microbes in the hope that some would survive and spread. Then hit the oceanic moons. As silly as that plan may be, it's way better than shuffling along with no species-level goal (other than the core goal of survival). If we just measure ourselves by how efficiently we turn food into people, as nature wills, we'll miss our chance at grandeur. Humankind isn't going to be around forever. We need to do something really excellent before we go extinct. Religions offer goals but they get so many simple things wrong that they can't be trusted. Their goofy ideas should be ignored. Please share your ideas for what Humanity's ultimate purpose should be.
1217	I am well aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them (making me no better than them)? Because of this, I feel like I am actually closing my mind to a lot of good, right-suppoted ideas. Fox News has singlehandedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which is something that I do not like.
1218	I would like to start off by saying I'm a generally positive person. Although, sometimes I feel with all the political corruption, environmental pollution, debt, inflation, overpopulation, peak oil, dwindling resources, climate change etc.. I can't help but think that the world is just one small step away from a global disaster. I know this is a very loaded question with many possible directions. But I wish I had a little more hope about the future of the world and mankind. Please help me change my view.
1219	To keep this a narrowly focused conversation I ask that colleges in large cities be excluded from this discussion. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a "college town" considering this factor makes the topic too broad for productive discussion.
1220	If there was high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would their need to be an influx of more cheap labor?
1221	If the government seeks to deprive me of the means (like a gun) to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then the burden of responsibility to protect me falls on the government. To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder. If someone is injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, but were unable to do so because the government deprived them of the means to defend themselves, then I think the government shares some part of the blame for allowing that situation to happen.
1222	The usual counter-argument is that anything that can be invented needs to come from previous knowledge. Knowledge is usually collective (laws of physics, previous discoveries/inventions), meaning that the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to mankind as a whole. However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental. I also believe that abolishing intellectual property could result prejudicial to science and progress as less people would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovating.
1223	I think the killing of the palestinians in Isreal is taking the shapes of genocide. By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the casualties on the side of the palistinians massively outnumber the ones on the Isrealian side. They don't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from palistina. If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill them.
1224	At every job I have worked at, part time to full time, one is not allowed to have any piercings (this includes clear studs) or visible tattoos. Ear piercings are allowed, however, any other piercing is to be taken out which I also believe to be rubbish and prolonging the negative judgment behind piercings that are not on the ears. I understand if the context on either the tattoo or the jewelry have an offensive image on them, but if there is not then there should be no problem to show them at the work place. I believe the rejection of showing them only prolongs the idea that tattoos and piercings are for immature, wrongly rebellious and unprofessional citizens.
1225	There should be no "freedom of religion" because religion is a false concept- it's like having the freedom to use whatever perpetual motion machine you prefer. Because those are not real, guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful. Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference.
1226	I keep hearing about this as a 'hot button' issue in the media. I feel that having to present a photo ID to prove you are the person you claim to be voting as, and to prove you are in fact of legal voting age is a fair requirement. Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for(car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling on an airplane, etc.) requires ID so why not something as important as voting. Then there are even some that call it discriminatory even going as far as comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crowe laws. I feel that it only discriminates against people who have bad priorities (IE someone who registers to vote, but doesn't feel the need to get actual Identification.) Please change my view. Thank you.
1227	If I understand my history correctly, the idea of a 12 hour clock is basically a relic from a time before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time. I don't see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like "am". It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00PM.) From what I can gather, the only reason we still use 12-hr clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.
1228	I honestly think that Fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation and it's people if it is done correctly with a great leader such as FDR, obviously it doesn't work with people like Hitler or Mussolini but what about Hideki Tojo, in my opinion he was a pretty good leader with his people's hopes in front of him, only to make bad choices by supporting the Axis. Though he still knew when it was time to give up and even stopped causing the blood of his people to be shed after seeing the destruction of the Atomic Bomb. So what would happen if Fascism still existed, with a competent and great leader in control? My opinion, is that it would become prosperous.
1229	We see naked animals all the time, and that sex is how most animals procreate is common scientific knowledge. Most people survive encountering naked animals, or even animals having sex with little to no issues. People are basically high functioning animals, and the existence of nude beaches/nudist colonies and swingers clubs/porn shoots is proof that nudity/sex in front of other people is not a danger or harms the non-participating parties in any way. Since there is no harm, there should be no laws regulating how we choose to clothe ourselves or where we engage in consenting activities, so long as we are legally allowed to be there (i.e. This does not apply to another persons private property, where they would have final say). CMV.
1230	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then".**
1231	When attempting to generate creative solutions, it's best to keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them (one should keep them in mind and only qualify them to varying degrees). Entirely rejecting ideas or the weaker associations between different ideas, while seemingly pragmatic, only serves to stifle the creative process. Thus, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to occur effectively. Do you agree or disagree, and why?
1232	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk AKA Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o) Anyway, back to the subject at hand. Thoughtprocess' Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk. Snapilicious!
1233	EXCUSE ME! wow someone is very agressive...me? nah I tell the truth...17 years old...very athletic...joined the army reserves recently and I'm a straight A student who might occaisonally recieve a B+...so I'm not retarded, which I think accusing people of being retards is a very rude thing to say because retardation is an unfortunate thing to happen to any person and there are actual retards out there, and I'm entering my senior year of high school meaning i haven't dropped out...and since I'm active and very athletic I'm not a lazy fat ass...thank you very much!
1234	Dark Knight is a grand epic, but Year One's strength is in its subtleties. It's more crime comic then a superhero tale, where Batman fights dirty cops and the mob with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli's realistic art matches the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less revenge driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they should have made more than four issues.
1235	I think we should. Think about it. There are people in Darfur who are being slayn without mercy, and we are letting it happen. Consider this: if there was a group of terrorists in our homeland, then wouldn't you want help? It's the same scenario for the people in Darfur, they want help, but they aren't getting it. Also, if we lend a helping hand, then it will put in a good word for the US.
1236	I can easily guarantee that most people who say this have a very weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Moreover, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet. People fail to look at history objectively and only assess it in the context of their own generation. I'm not a fan of Obama at all, but I can reassure you, we've had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse than Obama is.
1237	If you were rich you could live at whatever standard you chose, you could go on vacation, you could feed your interests and hobbies, and live whatever life you wanted. If that didn't do it for you, you could give a bunch of money to the poor and people would like you anyway. If you still felt insecure about things you could hire a coach and stuff so you wouldn't be, and your friends around you would make you feel better, especially if you used that money for a good cause
1238	I think the consequences are fair. People having to register as sex offenders, serving jail time, paying fines, etc.. These rules were created for actual pedophiles. If teens and younger people who "don't deserve it" are being subject to this as well, then they do deserve it, for the reason that they choose to act like these criminals, and they need to be taught a lesson. Things are being taken for granted too much within this generation.
1239	As a Catholic i have to say that it should be illegal. Because it is against my religion to kill an innocent baby.
1240	As a brief intro to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. For those who don't know much philosophy, just argue about the question. For those of us who know much about philosophy, there will also be a debate within the debate. I will be arguing that we should kill the one person. My first regular argument is that even if you don't intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them. My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.
1241	There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
1242	---Could we have someone to take the place of IE--- Opera is great. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the least recognition. Take "Speed dial" for example. It puts your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add ons, but it's community is just beginning. Also, it was recently rated very highly in CPU magazine, with its only flaw being it's lack of add ons, which is greatly increasing. Opera will be releasing a new version of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of it's competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
1243	"Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious "war" in history." The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same *number* of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war. A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
1244	Love is nothing more then a chemical reaction in the brain. So who is to say that teens can't fall in love? Atleast for a period of time.
1245	I don't know this story, I'm not familiar with the details. I don't know what constituted the slap, how heavy the slap was or to what part of the body. There's a lot of information here I am missing. But I truly do believe that to turn one's back on a hostile situation like that and note that it is the domain of policing or child protective services deprives us a little bit of our humanity. I'm not saying that every intervention needs to be violent or threatening in nature, but I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and important to act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences. This is what compels us to stop when we see an accident and offer assistance. If it was me, I'd like to think I would have intervened. Who can say unless you're in the situation, though.
1246	We have to accept that for a 20 year span starting in about 1985 or so, steroids were prevalent in Major League Baseball. Will some of baseball's records be changed because of this? Probably. But so what. The Hall of Fame is, in effect, a museum that chronicles the history or baseball, good and bad. To omit someone from the Hall of Fame because of'suspected' steroid use is ridiculous. It is crazy to let one person into the Hall because we 'don't think' they took steroids, but prevent someone else from entering because "we think" they did.
1247	This debate to me, has no moral. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women and here we are, looking at women have to raise children. Children choose in the court or in an out of court statement who they would like to live with. If the mother is in a mental state then who is she to raise children to be somebody one day. Maybe you should say that in most cases children opt to live with mothers, but there are some cases were fathers step in and personally, i think they MUST STEP IN.
1248	Ok....I still love the food, but I stopped going here because the service is terrible. Case in point: went today with a small group and the place was not busy at 1pm, but the waitresses acted like they were still slammed and the place was still filthy. The waitress we had (red hair and looked like she belonged in a crack den) was rude and kept acting like we were an inconvenience. Even when I went to pay she was a little snarky. That being said, I still over tipped because it is a holiday.
1249	This place is bad. We walk in and no one acknowledges us for over 5 min, but employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally they told us it would be a 10 min wait. We waited a few min and then they said it was going to be a 15 min wait. There were plenty of seats open too. Very poor people skills, including what looked to be a young lady Mgr.
1250	Very good! If I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll be here. This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ eateries next to Gen and Hwaro. We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is good too and there are a lot of sides! Also the steamed egg is always good when cooled down. I just wish this place had gyoza or other appetizers but in all, I'll keep coming back here. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we end up going to Rolled Ice Cream after!
1251	After a year i have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review i have tried many different foods and always find them being my favorite compared to anywhere else. Every time i go here I am greeted by courteous employees and they remember me every time. I have had nice conversations with Steven (hope that's the correct spelling), begging him to open a store in Peterborough so I can enjoy the food more often. Some of the dishes I would recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and the Goat Curry. There are so many other delicious selections though. If you are looking for something different or just looking for a new spot to eat I highly recommend The Zen.
1252	I was more than pleased by both the food and the atmosphere.
1253	Very good, exceeded our expectations! I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream come true. We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it, I'd say it's the most tender meat you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected. Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!
1254	I'll start off by saying that this was my first time at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things. We went for breakfast before our train back to the States.
1255	I think it is bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough so band school uniform OK
1256	No match, because FF is better for my use in every way.
1257	Well it all pretty much depends....Like if she killed someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this is a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah im not to sure
1258	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if I were to do something like that she would be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.
1259	books is better than tv because it is cheaper to buy a book if you wanted to buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy a tv licence books can help you learn a lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids so books are well better
1260	books will be always great whatever the new technological developments emerge books has its fixed place in every humans heart
1261	i strongly believe that india cannot lead. u people talk about the 7th, 3rd, 2nd rank of india in area defense and arable land respectively but here we r talking about the supreme power we cant rely on 2nd or 3rd. moreover the people r lazy they don't have the time 2 think about country's development they r happy at their home
1262	well, India is finding difficult to manage itself first...so there's no question of leading the world so far...but still if we compare so lets have a look at the following points: 1. almost 90% of India is illiterate (don't be sure of the percentage), so an illiterate country can't lead the world.... 2.India is more into castes, politics, religions and less into development. 3.the most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself... So if it goes on so then it is difficult or even impossible to say that "INDIANA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT CANNOT LEAD ITSELF!!"
1263	India has the potential to lead because it has the second largest man power n third largest army in the world n it is a country full of hopes n aspirations n for Indians nothing is impossible, n we r proud to be Indians n we will lead the world n be the king of the world in every manner. even 34% scientists in NASA are Indians.
1264	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
1265	I think it would be better fatherless the reason why is because i have never had a father in my life. I think that if you have a bad father you will be taught to be bad just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a jerk for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same as a father can, well at least my mother did.
1266	Right Now, In my opinion to be fatherless. Trust me I went through it. Sometimes I wish I had a bad father but yet not having a father is so much better. It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen my father but if he doesn't care then why should I? If he wanted to be in my life he could've been in my life. But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.
1267	No.If you research about FarQuhar.He didn't do anything to help Singapore while Raffles was away,instead of doing anything he just made a big mess and allowed things like vice,crimes and gambling dens carry on.
1268	in the past, children could walk around as they pleased, to and from the candy store, to and from school. now there are child pornographers, sexual predators online. porn has opened the doors to new crimes.
1269	Even though humans have sexual desires, it doesn't mean people you don't even know should watch you in pornographic content. Have sexual desires for the one you love.
1270	I meant to say creationist version of evolution. My apologies.
1271	I can show you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history
1272	That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't? Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? I mean, if it happened billions of years ago than how come its not happening today? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
1273	You go to school with me and you are 14 years old.
1274	people are just sitting on there asses all day playing video games when they need there exercise. So fat people go out side and play football or something and people that are not fat stop playing video games and go and get your energy back and these are my words "peace out assholes".
1275	i think we should have gym because kids get fat and tubby! its not ok for kids to get fat and tubby!!!!!
1276	Faquhar solved problems in Singapore using cash from his own pocket. For instance, when Singapore was once infested with rats and centipedes, Farquhar rewarded the people with coins for every pest they catch. This solved the problem quickly, as he held to his promise.
1277	There were pests like centipedes and rats all over the island. These pests hurt some people and the rats also destroyed the food supplies. Tigers were also a threat to the people here. He solved it by giving rewards.
1278	Farquhar ordered his men to go to Malacca and bring some food back. The traders in Singapore also brought some of the necessities.
1279	It's not yours, nor anyone else's but the person involved's decision as to whether or not they want an abortion. This is such an overblown issue that people on both sides are being killed over it--it's ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.
1280	Hitler's mother wanted to have him aborted, and it is difficult to say they should have let her.
1281	There is no argument need to be made. The entire scientific community agrees that evolution happened and is still happening.
1282	Everyone has their own desires, and sure women are degraded by pornography, but it's their choice to choose that career path. If they want to be in that business, it's their choice.
1283	The easy access to pornography may be the reason there has been an 85 percent decline in rapes over the last 25 years, according to a law professor at Northwestern University.
1284	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn is degrading anyone. Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
1285	Some people say God is against porn, but we won't know that because the bible does not mention porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?
1286	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. For example, we need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
1287	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport where the players all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
1288	I feel like advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
1289	1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms 2. Okay Look school is for learning not how you look and dress but maybe in some levels it matters and most people that go to school that don't have uniforms take like about 1 hr just to find their pants or shirt. I mean really?? When you have a uniform it takes less than 10 min just to take it out and put it on and
1290	it is a good idea... children should be equal, and do not compare clothes of each other... if they see something new from their classmates, they want to buy it, even it is not necessary...
1291	Means you don't have to worry about what you hve to wear! Less awkward when people say wear school uniform and you wear mufti...
1292	With uniforms there will be less of oh you dont wear this and you wear that. Then everyone is wearing the same thing and 1. it looks nicer 2. you dont have to spend forever trying to figure out what you are going to wear and 3. less drama, everyones wearing the same thing.
1293	I Believe that its better to have a loving father than no father; because growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood.Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also growing up without a loving father would mean you cant prove to your father that there is greatness in him; meaning the son he made turns out to become a bright and better person in society.
1294	I like television because you can watch all the porn you want with your family
1295	TV can be more engaging than books because TV can show the characters' faces and the action can be displayed that is hard for one to decipher from a book.
1296	I'm not sayin this cuz I love the tube, but you get more information than you think in the tube. EX) News, Baseball, Spongebob, etc.
1297	You can watch TV in one sitting where as a book takes all day to read. So no physical exercise will get done reading books. Exercise shows on TV make you move. So TV IS WAY BETTER THEN BOOKS!!!!!!!
1298	GO TV!!!!!! GO TV!!!! TV will win hopefully LOL TV is great to watch anything
1299	The American Water companies are Aquafina (Pepsi), Dasani (Coke), Perrier (Nestle) which employ people,
1300	Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day which is helping the economy com out of this recession we are in. maybe not in a big way but every kid of help counts! Bottled water also only makes less then 1&#xof; the worlds wastes and can be recycled! According to the National Association for PET Container resources, PET water bottles are no the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number! http://www.nestlewaterscorporate.com/bottled_water_things_to_know/Video/index.html?@videoList.featured=31101711001
1301	Why are you discussing a U.S. decision when you are in Canada?
1302	Yes, that is true if they continue to manage the positive and effective economic agenda. The first thing they need is to promote their economic policy to every investors and their tourism. Regards, Jerwin "consultant of poster printing san francisco"
1303	india international institute like nalanda where students of many countries came for studies..discovery of decimal and 0
1304	indian culture,,and languages are established 2000yrs ago where other countries are finding there linguags
1305	ndians has always been powerful why r u forgetting about its ancient history
1306	i think there is no doubt on this that india has the potential to lead the world.
1307	I'm sad to see the way this turned out. With not so little respect and so much spamming. I choose atheism over a Christianity because there is not enough evidence to satisfy my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
1308	Notmymuse, Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. I have yet to see one shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary. Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument). Once you have done this, disprove all logical arguments against Christianity. Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.
1309	there is no god. Science has proven it. It was just an excuse made up so people from simplier times didnt have to think to hard on those big questions.
1310	No one has ever claimed to have waged a war in the name of atheism.
1311	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
1312	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad, they will get hit.
1313	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds and I think it did more good than harm. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
1314	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For a ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.
1315	I DON'T BELIEVE IN CHRISTIANITY NOR ATHEISM. I AM A MUSLIM, THATS THE MOST VALUED RELIGION...
1316	all this debate proves is that the internet is full of conceded, stuck up, narcissistic, atheists who are totally bigoted and intolerant of other peoples beliefs and cant leave people alone to worship or not worship as they chose athieists are bigots plain and simple
1317	Science attests to the existence of a God, its only a question of which one at this point.
1318	Christianity, because I always root for the underdog. The membership of the atheist here is way bigger. Just look at the congregations of both.
1319	Christianity does offer hope in the world. Christianity does tell others to help the needy.
1320	God helps those who help themselves! So i will go and help myself to school laptops then god will help me?
1321	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option. Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
1322	Because if the child is young they dont know whats wrong and whats right the parent needs to teach the child from whats wrong and from whats right
1323	Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them.
1324	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you can give your child.
1325	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.
1326	I'm all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when the line is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it but then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be driven to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
1327	having some choices are good. but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. i have always been pro life. and yes i do believe abortions should be illegal.
1328	Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid yourself of moves away at the first sign of pain, without you feeling it, then "that" is no longer yours, since it feels outside your own.
1329	Gays are human beings just like we are, and should have the right to marriage just like we are.
1330	Definately, the egg and spoon race is a wicked idea! And maybe we should have the royal family breed up a few more uinterbred little kids to partake in the warfare. Imagine them up against the vodka drinking russians. I reckon there would be if there were no ewapons> less control over the masses - which has to be a good thing. And there would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world. There'd be little communes, and then gang rivaled cities. But at least all the fighting nobheads would kill themselves in one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it.
1331	I don't think it's at all charitable of you to donate your old clothes that you no longer want and then expect to get financial compensation ie a tax write off in return. Do you even know the meaning of charitable? P.S. Why don't you sell the clothing to some homeless'street' people? They have money from begging and can probably skip a meal or two to buy some clothes. (Just a thought)
1332	a proposal for an amendment for the Constitution would be to change the requirements to be president. you would still have to be 35 years old and be a resident in the United States for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part. instead of being a natural-born citizen make it be a United States citizen for 40 years. this way people whose parents move here when they are kids; these would be the only ways that they know and know as much as any other kid here. i think this would be a great topic to talk about in your paper and could easily elaborate on with examples. remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
1333	They are treated differently because attemepted murder and an officer involved shooting are completely different things. If a citizen, as you put it, "commits attempted murder", he goes to jail when the investigation has been completed and probable cause has been found. Also, he does get bail for an attempted murder charge. People also get bail in murder charges, so I'm not really sure where you are going with that. If an officer gets in a shooting on-duty, he/she was probably faced with a direct threat to his/her life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed.
1334	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor. This is a good thing as it allows you to invest the money, instead of letting it sit in your bank account. If this is court awared inheritance, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor. Aside from the investing, what the person whants to do with the money is up to them. There really isn't any other steps to worry about. You don't need to tell the government, you don't need to include it on your taxes unless you want to, and frankly, other than investing, there isn't much more for you to do, aside from get the check, cash it, invest it, and live.
1335	If your serious, maybe think about donating some to a worthy cause. A young family struggling to make it and going to work everyday. An elderly person living on social security and can't afford their electric bill. Donate to a children's hospital, animal protective society, or senior center in your area. Lots of things you can do with it. I hope you find what your looking for.
1336	If he does not already have a competent attorney, you need to hire one immediately. These types of cases can be especially complicated, as there is more at stake than you may realize. For instance, a conviction on a drug charge may mean reduced or little eligibility for federal student aid in college, (if he decides to go that route). Although it IS against the law to give anyone a drug that is not prescribed for him, there is always grounds to review this with the prosecuting authority. I urge you to contact a criminal defense attorney in your area. Be prepared to pay a sizeable retainer. For a referral to a criminal defense attorney, contact your local or state bar association.
1337	Is this a traffic ticket? What does it say on the ticket? If it says that there is a mandatory court appearance, then you need to go. I wouldn't listen to the cop. Unless it's printed on the ticket that you need to appear, just pay the fine or whatever it says on the ticket. It is important that you follow the printed instructions. Or just ask your husband. He probably knows the city's counsel and can get you out of this whole thing.
1338	Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized; let local governments decide if they want it or not and handle it either through ordinances or zoning laws. Same thing with drugs - decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades. There's no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.
1339	He is doing exactly as he should. These cases can cost a firm a fortune to pursue and he needs to make sure that taking this case on is a good financial decision, meaning that not only is it a good case that they can reasonably expect to win on but also that the recovery involved will be sufficient to justify the time and expense involved in taking it on. He can't do that without an informed opinion on the facts involved. What more are you expecting him to tell you? He will either agree to represent you or decline based upon the others opinion weighed against his risk factors. And even if he declines to represent you, it doesn't necessarily mean that your case isn't worth pursuing in general. It just means that it isn't worth it to him. If he feels you have no case, he will tell you that also.
1340	Well, if that someone was under oath and was "giving himself in" I'm sure that they would accommodate the person! Seeing as how you said that there was a Court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served. It would be a time-consuming process of course as are any arrests but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork. Anybody who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow. Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth So Help Them God. So God if your listening, Help Them!!!
1341	What?!? And all these years I've been paying... No, we are absolutely required to pay income taxes! We actually OVER-pay each year, and then in the Spring we get a partial refund. That's always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas, or to do a home improvement project. But many Americans end up having to pay in even more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year.
1342	Even if there arent any minors, the language which you use should attract the people and not distract. There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep'I dont care'kind of the attitude. They think that you cant catch them. They dont even care to see your reaction. They dont wait for one. They know well that thier answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care? Just vomit and earn few points. Moreover it takes some brains to answer a question which they dont have. Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in thier approach. Come on....'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term. The ethics, values etc are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. You have got plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one cant find them and starts using fowl language. Therefore I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and keep on sharing your knowledge with us. Hope to hear from you soon.
1343	Is it legal to push your religeon on those that dont believe in it?!?!?! I think that answers your question. Better yet - if it was Islam they were pushing in school, would you want your child present??? Not only is it moral to remove religion from schools, it should be mandatory. Children are in school to LEARN, not to pray, not to learn about God. God cant get you a job or pay your bills. If you insist on God being present in schools, send your children to the seminary for an education.
1344	well strike the 3rd answer down dude.false imprisonment is something that happens more than you think especially in states that do not have discovery laws.and in my opinon they do not have those laws for the simple reason they want to be able to railroad the poor and innocent and "falsely imprison"them.the southern states ars real good at that. as long as there is no discoverly then the prosecution can hide facts that downright prove the charged person is innocent.and yes they knowingly do this just to embellish their conviction record to help futher their careers down the road and the part that kills me is not only are these low lifes still able to sleep but,the Law lets them get away with it and when it is,(years later usually)discovered there is nothing the innocent person can do to get back the freedom that was taken from him.
1345	Your odds are not good getting beyond his limits. Your attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case you would have to go after him for garnishments,etc.. If he does not own a paid home or other material goods the attorney probably won't bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance. That will usually cover for uninsured motorists if you carry that coverage but he would have to determine of you could use it since you weren't driving at the time. Since you say you have $170000 in medical bills I am guessing you don't have any personal medical insurance either. Your attorney should be able to tell you what to expect to receive after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
1346	Depends. Both are given due to obvious and extreme criminal offenses. But then, I would really agree with you that death penalty is something that should be abolished. I dont know, I am not talking from the legal point of view, but on a moral level that no one has a right to take another persons life, if crime is committed the punishment should be ''corrective'' and something where the criminal should go through repent. Entire life in jail, made to rot in jail, or made to work, is better than putting someone to death.
1347	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)?
1348	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc. So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us. Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically. So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smoke satellite that it was for decades.
1349	You have all missed the point. Confidential sources within the Government that leak classified information are not covered by the freedom of the press. When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another. When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American People (nuclear secrets, etc), you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole. Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want. It doesn't mean that you are free of the consequences. Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle. He shoulda been hung.
1350	Our constitutional right to privacy was definitely negated in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I do not think it would be too hard for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop the legal way. Bush is just trying to cover his butts, as well as other members of our government are doing likewise. There are many conspiracy theories floating around concerning Bush and a few other members of our government, I think it is time the people of this nation take our government back, too many "actors" in power with selfish intentions!
1351	Scott Peterson was the white juxtaposition to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman." Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were nice looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us. 1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant. 2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
1352	I disagree. Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision. Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society. Singapore is a society which tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created. Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.
1353	Be careful. If you keep making sense, they'll start listening to your phone calls and reading your e-mail.
1354	The concept that people have this *right* is an ethical question and I support the position that all have this right. Whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive. In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights, including that of information. (1) Every country has a segment that would restrict information and any of the other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of political party there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish controls and those who do not want controls.
1355	Sure lets substitute one form of discrimination for another good idea. Now instead of being proud of what they accomplished they will always know they didnt have to work as hard as other people because they were given positions. I think reverse descrimination fuels a new type of racism. I hate the people that got into college with low test scores/gpa just beacause of their race. And on top of that they get money for being their. So congradulation R.D. you have made me into a racist.
1356	Blame the sanitation workers who fought for better wages, benefits, etc. instead of fighting for an education. Blame the unions, and blame the employers for falling for their diatribe. Americans are doing themselves out of jobs. Don't point a finger at immigrants or the employers. Where else can people who don't fit well within society find work at $20 an hour with health insurance, vacation and paid sick days?
1357	Marriage is a business, and the license makes it legal. It is there to protect women's interests as far as property is concerned, and for raising children. It is a protection. if you don't plan on staying with someone, or having children, or making property community, there is no need for it. People shouldn't enter into it lightly, and I think it would help the divorce rate if the benefits of marriage were eliminated. People couldn't marry for money, or insurance, etc...
1358	No. Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include floogging and capital punishment in their justice system.
1359	The church has a tendency to exonerate itself when ever it sees fit on what ever the matter might be. I don't see where this would be no different. The idea that the church is NOT flawed and IS the body of Christ is something that it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since its conception. If it shows flaw. Misjudgment, mismanagement, what ever the case might be, can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections? So to answer the question yes I feel it does exonerate itself.
1360	It certainly can if you have the right attorney. Racial remarks are a form of sexual harrassment and the company, along with the person, and the supervisor can be held liable for it.
1361	Saying it with an "a" and saying ith with an "er" is no difference. Think about it, Most Black people cut the "er" off of words in the first place, while white people don't. So the actual pronunciation does not take away form the degradation of the word. I have been black all my life. I have listened to my mom say it, I have listened to my dad say it, but I never really used it.(sometimes by mistake if the people that I am with say it a lot, but I ALWAYS correct myself). I hate that word, and its use. I think people use it because they are afraid of saying something else and looking "corny". When I was in college, I suggested Not my "ni99a, my brother" day, and it worked.
1362	annie red I am unsure about religion and I am a woman. I have yet to hear a logical reason why abortion should be allowed at any time for any reason other than to save the mother's life. Partial birth abortion is not only murder. It is murder by torture. Stop stereotyping members of the pro-life movement. By the way. Why do liberals assume that conservatives have been brainwashed into their beliefs? Has it never occured to you that the asker has already looked at all sides of the issue?
1363	Money is NOT the root of all evil...the LOVE of money is the root of all evil. What this means is, people put money above the Great Spirit (God, Buddha, whatever you call your higher power), before family, friends all they care about is getting more money, greed. Love IS the greatest thing in the world, the problem is people love money!
1364	It all depends on the crime. For the most part i believe if your grown enough to go and do an adult crime then you need to do the adult time. If we continue to let the youth get away with serious crimes then older crimebodies will continue to get our youth in trouble. We must raise our children correctly so they want end up in some prison but there are certain things that is morally wrong no matter if your 15 or 35 and those are the crimes our young "adult" should be charged for.
1365	If you have a lawyer, notify him or her right away. If you don't have a lawyer, get one. You should contact the court to determine if a hearing is actually set for Friday. Even though you might not have been served with papers, it would not be a good idea to ignore this situation. For you all you, your ex might have gotten someone to falsify a proof of service to show that you were properly served. You might have to request a continuance and properly prepare for the hearing. If there is a hearing and you don't show up, the court might make and adverse ruling against you that could be difficult to undo.
1366	Youtube is a big video website that hosts many videos. Twitch is a streaming website where you mostly watch someone playing a game. If Youtube were to take over Twitch, they could help a lot with the servers and so Twitch would run faster. This is just my speculation though. Also, Youtubers could get help with streaming and this would help promote their channel. Youtube could also be then catering to a wider audience, thus making Youtube bigger.
1367	The government does have the right idea that teenagers shouldn't be drinking alcohol, but in my view, nobody who has passed his or her teenage years should be denied.
1368	In the UK every few years the government's 'cabinet' has a reshuffle and the minister in charge of, for example, education moves job to become minister in charge of transport. Surely it would be more sensible if every few years elections were held where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position? The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me - CMV.
1369	I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or and extremely bad start in life. However the majority of poor Americans are content, and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society.
1370	My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat the entire school must pile up in our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad come. However a smart terrorist (or whomever) could easily find this out (every school does the same and says it on our website) and plant a bomb in said stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to just run to my car (off campus) and escape. Its worth saving my life 100% of the time. My school tells us whether or not we have a drill that day or not so I would know if its a legitimate threat. CMV.
1371	"Public officials" might really be elected, though the process is hardly transparent and verifiable by most voters, but they rarely face penalties for making their bad ideas into laws that others have sworn to enforce. This also applies to the enforcers. If they do experience scandal for their wrongdoings, the worst that happens to them is losing the next election. In extremely rare cases they might spend some months in the fanciest prison, whereas those who are not politically connected and do the same crime face long prison sentences. "Public officials" take advantage of ample opportunities to accept donations from special interests in exchange for passing laws which favor the special interests. The officials then continue to cash in on this exchange by investing in the firms they have helped to protect from competition, in addition to numerous other kickbacks; namely, lucrative "consulting" gigs and the like. Why are most people okay with this? Are they just ignorant of the mechanism of this political machine?
1372	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced. But I don't see why anybody cares. The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there's a handful of titans ducking it out, not a mediocre field where anybody can win. Sure, Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga. But tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other. People don't tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in probably any sport. True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a middle-of-the-pack team. Why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?
1373	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the latter of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way). The argument is that it's considerate, but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out. And in a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again. Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
1374	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to the public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).
1375	Basically I think that the public has a right to know about stabbings, robbery, etc. but should not disclose the name(s) of the perpetrators to the general public unless it's a matter of security (the criminal is currently at large or imprisoned.)
1376	It seems the more we learn about climate change, the scarier the picture becomes and the more it seems that we've only just begun to scratch the surface of how the Earth's systems work and interact.
1377	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I urinate. Over time I began to do it more often. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean tha it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.
1378	I'm a really young male (19) but I am seriously considering having a rhinoplasty, chin, jaw and cheek augmentation. I would never say that I'm ugly but I am pretty average. I think that once I get the procedures done I will become dramatically more attractive/handsome. I think that more girls will check me and that would boost my confidence to approach them, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face(and a strong body which I'm gonna build) will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.
1379	Get over here...the most over-rated saying coming from that desert-dwelling sand wanderer. I'd much rather be too cold vs too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the most of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and be able to walk up and smacking them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a complete use of magic. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Change my view?
1380	I honestly have a problem with the whole "rape culture" thing. We live in a safer time than ever before. The odds of being a victim of violent crime at any given time are lower than they have ever been.
1381	I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly have my life we have "at war" with al qaeda/terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expensive of using that GDP to help our own citizens.
1382	I am a casual smoker. I usually buy a pack maybe 5 times a year. In times of stress. This time it was an ugly break up. Am I fooling myself by rationalizing that American Spirits aren't so bad because there's no additives? To me, I think it's just tobacco so it's the harm of smoking which isn't good but there's no FSC or arsenic and all that sooo I mean it's a pretty decent option when I need to unwind, no?
1383	I've been to 4 methods of schooling. The problem with all of them is that they base on memorization instead understanding the concept of what is being taught. I have honestly learned more from reading. I think the education should be improved where students can pick their classes. Though, I understand, some classes are needed. But, others aren't.
1384	If you clearly did or did not commit a crime, your punishment (or lack there of) will be consistent with whats fair in most cases. However, having been put through the Illinois Court System, i now know that getting what you want legally is based much more on who you know. Its very much about connections. Connections between Prosecutors and Defense, Prosecutor and Judge, Defense and Judge, etc... Such is life though. The best way to be successful is to have an advantage over the other guy IMHO. Something that distinguishes you from them.
1385	Europe In physical geography terms is not a continent. Rather it is a cultural realm. There is no major division between Europe and Asia. Some might argue for the Ural Mountains as a barrier if you look at it from a satellite view, but no other continents are divided by a single mountain chain. Continents are divided by vast oceans and seas. Powerful Europeans just didn't want to be associated with Asia and wanted to be considered their own physical continent.
1386	The impeachment of a president at this state in our nation's history would be disastrous, and catastrophic. All of those who believe president Obama is such an awful president must not realize he is not the one who originally put us into such a sorry economic state, if he does continue improving the economy it is possible we can set ourselves back on the correct track.
1387	You can't (at least in America) legally tell other people what they can and can't read, write, or listen to as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, if you are reading, writing, or listening to a direct order to kill someone innocent, and intend to follow that order, it's illegal. You certainly have no right to tell people what they view in their own homes, away from you and impressionable minds in society. Viewing porn in private is and should be legal.
1388	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, then if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However this would only be the case of course if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
1389	I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons. 1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult three times over. 2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person. 3. His credit card was reported being used after his death. 4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but with this kind of evidence, I feel there is no question that he was murdered.
1390	i believe that (thats what she said) is better because yo mama is just yo mama and (thats what she said) has not been around as much as (yo mama) but it is as clever. (thats what she said) goes with every thing and can be used for a good laugh every once in a while and it is a joke. unlike (yo mama) is more of an insult to people's acual mothers. of course there as been a tv show on mtv named "yo mama" and has major success on mtv and mtv2 but the show is nothing but lots of retarded people making up sencless jokes about each others moms and they all r different! but as to where (thats what she said) can be said to everything and anything! and it is alot more entertaining than "yo mama". and thats all i have too say about that.
1391	Nothing the US can do with China standing right behind North Korea, any action you take they can counter act. You just have to hope the Chinese can talk some sense into them. After all, there isn't a more westernised communist nation on the earth than China. Besides, sanctions only harm the innocent citizens, it does not do much to stop the leaders. Maybe proving Japan with nuclear weapons would combat North Korea, and act as a buffer? Who knows.
1392	Every one has the right to have his own opinions, to be open about them and to speak out loud his own thoughts, logical or not, you also have the right to listen to that person or not, to come back with your own ideas and opinions or to simply neglect him like if he doesn’t exist (of course if his ideas aren’t logical or acceptable)... It is a kind of oppression to define to people the way they should think and express themselves.
1393	Pascal's wager is not the best argument for the Christian faith, in fact I would not call it an argument at all. It is logically coherent, but really does not provide any good reasons to believe. However, it has persuaded some people to believe.
1394	I believe that euthanasia should be available to those who would like it. Euthanasia offers a painfree way to allow the patient to leave this earth on a happy note, for both the person and their families. Euthanasia can be a way that people in huge amounts of pain could go to and be put out of their pain instead of waking up each and every morning hping that tomorrow they won't. Euthanasia provides everyone with a safe and simple solution to end the human suffering.
1395	Trapper was a pretender, a goofball who got out while the gettin' was good. While he was back in the States starting his private practice (Trapper John, MD), BJ was with Hawkeye until the end. As the war dragged on, and Hawk was starting to lose it, did Trapper call to see how they were? No, but BJ was delighting his comrades with home films of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over surgery while Hawkeye was seeing chickens on buses.
1396	This is what I have learned from the "convinceme" pro choice debates. Living cells in a mothers womb, though possessing Human DNA that is distinct from the mother, is not human life. The fact that the unborn have a heartbeat AND a distinct DNA inside the womb does not mean it is human life. The fact that an unborn may have a distinct blood type from the mother, does have a distinct DNA, the DNA is Human and the cells are all replicating and living...Does not equal human life recognizable human hands, feet, eyes, facial features, reproductive organs and formed human organs in the unborn are not human life. i wonder... If none of those things are human life... What makes anyone reading this human? (take a pass on sentient being and souls and self awareness and all the other quasi mystic nonesense that science and the law don't concern themselves with) We have reasoned ourselves away while rationalizing the atrocity known as abortion.
1397	I would rather be deaf because they can practically cure deafness with a pretty advanced device. I'm not sure what the device or procedure is called, but what you wear a device on the outside of your ear that picks up sound. That device sends this sound to a device that is inserted into your brain, and through a series of nuerons, impulses, and electrical thingies "scientific term", you can hear. It's not exact, and it takes months for your brain to "learn" sound, but a lot of deaf people are having these surgeries. They are working on something similiar for eyes, but it is much more complicated, as the eye has so many nerve endings/connections.
1398	Debates are based on evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
1399	The Cold War is over, there's no more USSR, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, communist and or dictatorship countries. There are many US bases agricultors and companies wanting to trade with Cuba which will help open Cuban society as US business take hold on the island along with increased tourism making contact with Cubans. It is obviuos that the current political stance is a failure, there are 48 years of non-change to prove it, a new policy should be established, why continue with the same old, same old with no change? Jon Jax 71
1400	Yes....I feel it is a little much. On top of the religious aspect, I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools period. School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination. So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs. The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P). Further, I think Issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
1401	I think the worst problem can be when debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating about trivial things...such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion...don't we? I could argue about the member who posted the debate on being illiterate...and rant on about how ridiculous it is to make such a remark...after all, how could posters be illiterate, if they read and write? The person who created the debate obviously doesn't get that...even if it is just an attempt at being sarcastic...but what's the point?
1402	Jon Stewart has a much more sophisticated humour style, and tends to cover more important issues. He always has great interviews and the special reporters he has are great too. He also gets bonus points for being there first Stephen relies too much on gimmicky things and has a less sophisticated comedy style. The whole arrogant act he puts on can be irritating and he's generally not as genuinely funny as Stewart.
1403	yes. say that you only get your news from "fox news" and no where else, they put on wrong statements (such as labeling a congressional republican sexual predator as a democrat) and never make a correction. you now beleive that the sexual predator was a democrat congressman, your reality has been altered. but thats just a factual reality and can be easily remedied, i suppose the question meant as in making a person schitzophrenic or dillusional,
1404	This marks the first time I've ever given a five-star review to any form of chain restaurant, but it's well-warranted here. I've visited this location four times since it opened, and even at the height of the "NEW FOOD! EVERYBODY EAT THERE!" commotion, the staff was unfailingly polite and cheerful, the chicken was fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits were perfect and the dirty rice was great. I've even tried the Cajun tenders, and unlike most places where any form of boneless chicken has as much seasoning as the box in which it is delivered, the tenders here have some real kick. Make sure you get the "mild" ones for the kiddos. I'm taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and pondering picking up a big box o'bird to share with the teachers...
1405	One of the most disgusting restaurants I've ever eaten at. I was on a business trip in Phoenix and decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The place was bad news from the very beginning. The hostess was super unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell onto the table from the lamp shade overhead-- I should have gotten up then. The chips were greasy, margaritas straight sugar w/ very little liquor and the enchiladas bland as can be. In addition to this, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom. You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant.
1406	This place not only has burgers that aren't very good but the service is horrible! After I ordered people were waiting for over 40 minutes and there plane was boarding so they started yelling into the kitchen "JUST GIVE ME WHAT U GOT!" PUAHAHHAA thats when I relized i should of gone elsewhere... I ordered the ruby burger and realized there was no cheese with this burger, but come on plz put some mayo on my burger and dont over cook my paddy! I felt like I was eating a card board burger! SOOO nasty i only ate most of it cause i paid for it and i was hungry. Fries were fries nothing special. Wanted to go to burger king originally but the gate was closed to go there! NEVER GOING AGAIN!
1407	My husband and I came to celebrate his new position. We had excellent service and our food was great also. I had the Steak Diane and Salmon combo, while my husband enjoyed the shrimp and chicken alfredo. I chose to write this review because we also witnessed the staff accommodating a woman with a visual impairment. Her waitress literally read her the majority of the menu until she found something she wanted.
1408	We ordered margherita and diavola pizza and both were outstanding. We have been to Naples and had pizza there and the pizza at Inizio is the closest we have been able to find in the US. The sauce is delicious!!! The restaurant is really well decorated and has a great atmosphere and we loved the tables. The staff was also super friendly. Loved every bit of it; we will definitely be back!
1409	This place is not 5 stars, but with a few tweaks, it could be. I am giving it 4 stars because the ranking on yelp doesn't go any lower. I hope management is reading these reviews as most people are spot on. Needs: better customer service training for your staff, better lighting for night time sports, additional seating. These stuff is easy, but will be the demise if not corrected.
1410	Personally, I really like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. If you're looking for a rustic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, with the regular salad and rice, and an entrée of tzaziki, go ahead. Try it! The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time;) What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse. It's very cute. Like for a lot of people in the area, this is more of a summer destination rather than a middle of winter spot.
1411	Their gay! Actually this is just experience... I'm not gay but all the kids that are at my h-school are trying to get a petition signed for uniforms.
1412	Another reason argued against school uniforms is that they deprive the children of their individuality. The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.
1413	Kids don't want to wear the same clothes every day, and I know I would hate it.
1414	in my own personal opinion i think that school uniforms are not a good idea. adults are always telling us to be our selves and to express who we really are. but we cant do that while wearing a school uniform to school!!
1415	i dont think its a good idea to keep restrictions becoz thats just going to make students especialy teens more hungry for fashion.its better 2 feed them than keep them hungry.and once they r away from these restrictions,we will c d other side of them which is way worse with no morals.so alow people 2 b free with their personalities instead of stoping them.
1416	Firefox has nothing to do with apple or Steve Jobs. I'd say you're the fanatical zealot fanboy.
1417	Mozilla Firefox is considered to be better than Internet Explorer because it alerts you that it has blocked pop-ups and automatically updates the older version to the latest version along with a google toolbar and it downloads very quickly
1418	Internet Explorer uses extreme memory when running multiple tabs, and more than Firefox. And probably more; it could spawn multiple SVCHOST.exe instances and use those as a blind.
1419	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)
1420	While there are benefits to TV, i think books are better overall for learning as they require more focus.
1421	Television is almost the exact same thing as books, the only difference is, you actually have to move your eyes for books.
1422	When the U.S. fought the British for their independence, the British wore a red uniform. Every time the Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell, "The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming." If India ever tried to takeover the U.S., Americans would be forced to yell, "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming." ;)
1423	I think it's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father than having a uncaring and bad father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
1424	I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "bad father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a bad father I might then be a bad person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
1425	I think in any case its better to have no father then to have a bad father. Either way you still lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a bad father then whats the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a bad father figure.
1426	It was Raffles who signed the treaty with the Sultan Hussein,not Farquhar, who was just a subordinate.
1427	The Singapore Treaty is signed between Raffles, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong with Commandant under the accompanying seven ships witnessing the event.
1428	now tell me this evolution beleivers... how is it that evolution is true, and humankind is currently not evolving? and how is it (for those of you whom HAVE religion), that adam and eve were the first of the human race to walk on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? in arabic makind is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of adam...
1429	Coming from a casual internet user, I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I'm using firefox though, cause I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
1430	Kids are fat these days.. p.e. helps!!1!!!!!one!!!! and itll help them relize heath is important for their futures.
1431	I think it should be manditory. when you look on to the streets at kids playing they are most likley over weight because they eat to much and dont get enough physical exercise.
1432	Farquhar did all the ground work to improve Singapore while Raffles only dreamt about what to do.
1433	Without William Farquhar Singapore would have perished. Only because William was there to govern the country, Singapore continued to exist. Raffles left to govern another country.
1434	You don't know these girls'/women's stories, who are you to judge what they can or can't do? Until you've walked a mile in these girls' shoes, then you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.
1435	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly.
1436	Were we magically created in a few days or an outcome which was processed throughout billions of years?
1437	think about it, it's impossible for evolution to NOT happen. the weak die, the strong continue to breed. this strengthens the species. argument over. however, creationism and evolution are not exclusionary. i don't believe in a god simply because of the unbelievably minute chance of a god (or gods) existing
1438	whatever? porn is a way of life? i bet yous any money that all the people on the yes argument on how porn is wrong are virgins :L
1439	No porn is not wrong. Mabye some people thing it is wrong but really it is not. Come on if their was no porn and sex how would we have children.
1440	Advancing the common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
1441	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
1442	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have a small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.
1443	I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff. But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was ridiculous.
1444	it is good to follow to proper school code and the right to express emotions is right but not necessary as we have come school for learning
1445	I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be doing any important thing which help you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.
1446	I think that such a policy is a good idea because uniforms make students equal on an economic level. This can prevent envy and jealousy.
1447	Having a lousy father would be better than being fatherless. If you have a lousy father you can look at his mistakes, and avoid them. Also being fatherless would be hard on you and your mom. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father there to lend you a hand, even if he isn't very good.
1448	I believe its better to have a father than to be fatherless. I myself know what it's like to not have a father, so to me it would be better to have a bad father than no father at all. For some people, to have a bad father is like having no father. But in reality you don't really know how good your father is or how good you really have it until he is gone and never coming back.
1449	It's costly, wasteful and distracts from the brass ring of public health: the construction and maintenance of public water systems.
1450	Water bottles are bad because they cause pollution. Also some people sell water battles that have bacteria in them depending on were they get the water. Water bottles also cost more than tap water. Water systems are aging and there remains hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.
1451	can people say some points on TV is better than books because at our school were doing a debate can you please help!!!
1452	why would we ban a product that more than a million people buy when we are in the midst of a recession?
1453	When the most interesting man in the world is not drinking Dos equis, hes drinking bottled water.
1454	I don't know about you guys but water bottles are so convenient to me. What happens when I'm at the beach on a hot summers day and I'm getting all dehydrated and my only option for water is the ocean which I wouldn't drink from..I have two options, pass out from the heat and lack of water and waste the rest of my day sick/in the hospital..or drink out of a WATER BOTTLE.
1455	the last comment was put on the wrong side, my fault
1456	Of course its wrong. Why do you think homosexuality exists?
1457	Is marriage really just about "love?" I think not. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about "love" then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle-school could get married as well.
1458	Or do you mean that gay _sex_ is helping spread AIDS? In which case gay marriage may help reduce the problem. What is 'gay sex'? I think (and this is a wild guess) that the original argument the person was attempting to make was that UNPROTECTED ANAL sex can increase the liklihood of AIDS transmission. That might be true. But if it is, it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
1459	I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them. A law requiring separate schools and public accomodations for homosexual people would violate "separate but equal." However, law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.
1460	Yes. India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states of 28 ways, culture, geographical and language, it can certainly lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur, while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most technological developments. Economically also India isn't that low. Eg: Chandrayaan from India discovered water on Moon. What do u say about that? And the father of astronomy, aryabhatta was from India.
1461	I'm Christian and very religious, but if the description of this argument is the qualifying factor, I'm going with Atheism. God isn't a Christian.
1462	If god loves everyone then y does he hate gays and the bible is just a book, have you ever wondered if the one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "god" look good
1463	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worse because you were told not to already.
1464	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their kids but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
1465	Well though I behave as an atheist certainly I don't forget the principles and norms of Christianity;As this argument has heated up,Its better to conclude that this trend of atheism has not really gained that much ground and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
1466	You'd rather die believing in god,than not believing and finding out he exists!
1467	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more then what your kid had done like if some one else made them mad thy let it all out on them
1468	I think parents should not spank because there's other ways to make children behave.
1469	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. For example, there are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
1470	does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school then your parents steal your favorite toy. you stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. hm. same thing applies to this. you hit somebody then you get hit. you get told not to hit somebody, then told not to hit, then hit by the saame person.
1471	I would turn them in, because that is just crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime, I don't care who you are to me, or what you mean to me I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime as well, and I'm not going to jail.
1472	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premedicated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.
1473	i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.
1474	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and or is an acomplice is always caught. I dont want to be the one that is caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.
1475	I would say that most likely I would turn my husband in because a murderer is not who I wanted to marry. And also, if my husband killed someone else, who knows if his next attack will be on me. Obviously he is messed up in the head if he committed murder and thats not who I want to spend the rest of my life with.
1476	Sport should not be compulsaryy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1477	I'm in school and P.E. just makes kids unhappy,a lot of people get sad because they are chosen last,they can't play for example I suck at P.E. class I hate I'm always the last to be chosen for the teams and it's not cool and it's not just obese kids there are many obese adults who did P.E. and didn't helped in anything
1478	P.E. should be optional in 8th grade. If students want to participate, then so be it. However, in 8th grade students have a lot going on, that time may be used more beneficially by studying.
1479	The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of stupid jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
1480	it is simply too tiring. so that is the reason why physical education should not be compulsory.The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of stupid jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
1481	some children simply cannot take pe. 4 example some r already in athletics and they are alreaddy training like crazy
1482	i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsibility to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.
1483	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to pursue your personal interests first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.
1484	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursue your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
1485	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to pursue things for themselves, not for others.
1486	The person who threw the cup away is out immediately...The person who helped roll the cup rim down shouldn't have a leg to stand on..........unless there was an agreement made by the finder of the cup. If your neighbor asked for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigs, and a lottery ticket, do you deserve half the winnings.....NO.....So I would have to say the finder deserves the prize.....
1487	Look, this is what you need to do! Try and get the money. The hospital bills can be paid in full by the hospitals billing department, all you need to do is put a statement in writing stating you can not pay the bill and most hospitals have to clear the account. Thats most hospitals,,,not all will. But its worth it. If you have no means to pay for it, then you dont. My father just passed away and he had not a potty to even use, and I thought once I went to the showing they would try and get me..well they didnt, cause most states (if u look into it more) will grant you so much to lay them in the ground. My state here in Ohio gave my father $6000.00 for his..they have to do something with the funds for tax write off reasons. So call Legal Aide in your state and see what they tell you.
1488	Well, being a Christian does mean forgiveness; however, you shouldn't suffer do to the bad decisions of others. If you do plan to sue, sue only for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income. You are entitled to that amount. Make sure you have receipts for everything. It is not unethical to sue if your only in it for exact compensation and not for greed.
1489	Yes if you feel he is doing more damage than good by being involved in her life, you have the right to ask for sole custody. This can be hard to prove, especially if there has never been a court order in place as far as visitation. In my opinion, the judge would order specific days for visitation first. If he did not follow the visitation dates, the judge will assume that is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. Again, this may take some time. As for child support, definitely. He will be subject to back child support from the day she was born unless he can prove that he was paying. You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support payment/custody documents. Not hard to fill out and they will assist you in doing them. The more information you have about your daughters dad the better i.e. job information, social security, drivers license, address, etc.
1490	yes!!! the effects from "weed" are far less than the effects of alcohol, if it was legal it would free alot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime, and i believe it would cause alot less people to use harder drugs! and people who need it for medical reasons wouldn't have to go thru all the garbage they need to now for relief!!!
1491	I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise. However, a petition is not an actual "legal document"...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.
1492	No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman. So no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's just better to stay away from that kind of temptation.
1493	ethically, if your fathers insurance goes up you should pay it. it will probably get reviewed within six months. however the good news is this is just lifes lessons learned. you got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. she got a ticket because she was half to blame at least. lets assume there is a big doctor bill. you are probably insured on your fathers policy had you been at fault. your friend has the problem and he is totally at fault. he let you use the car. now if there is a big clain he is not insured because he didn't list you as a separate driver and he might have to pay out of his pocket. this is his problem not yours. i don't see this as an ethical problem for you because you are insured.
1494	Wow that had to hurt you alot. i Cannot imagine the thought that you were holding back someone you loved. BUT i do not think you are. If hes not worried i wouldn't either. Sounds like his boss needs to get with the times and realize that gays, interracial couples, lesbians and most relationships are common place. I am sure if he keeps pushing your boyfriend that he will make a decision to find another firm rather than loose you. Good luck.
1495	I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics. Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up. This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly). It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution.
1496	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's. Since most departments don't have in-car cameras, I don't think they "forgot" to tape your FST's. Your license is done and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you weren't drunk, you should have taken the breathalyser. Then again, people don't usually make sound decisions when they are drunk.
1497	Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. Sorry to say that those are not good legal grounds for a lawsuit. You will never find an attorney to take this kind of case on contingency. So, if you really want to pursue this you'll have to do it out of pocket, which will be obscenely expensive. If your reputation was not in fact harmed then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, etc and then let it go.
1498	Dear Friend, Do not let them do this. A person listed as "payable on death" has ZERO interest in your account while you are still alive. They just get any assets left WHEN you die, they are not on the hook for any liabilities -- certainly not while you're alive. Let them know you'll get a lawyer if they don't change their tune -- and that it'll cost them a LOT more than $800. Bank stealing money from poor children? Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up. Yours, Francesois
1499	It is very difficult to get sole custody. You have to PROVE that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail sounds bad but since she is in jail she can not be doing anything harmful. (In the courts point of view) Fighting this will be tough. You would be better off trying to change visitation. Try to get it that it has to be supervised. I would go talk to a lawyer. The first consultation is usually free. (and custody battles can be expensive)
1500	I am sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assault. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsable for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesnt help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse. Best wishes.
1501	If you purchased the dog in Florida, and you have resided here together and or apart for over a year, then the courts in Florida would have jurisdiction over this case. You can retain an attorney to file your claim here in Florida and have her served with papers out in Cali. If the dog is registered in your name, I don't foresee a problem with you getting the dog back. Good Luck and Take Care
1502	I am also for lowering the drinking age back to 18. I am 31, mother of 2 girls, and a health teacher. I would definitely vote it back in.
1503	I just don't know if you are referring Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people that were born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have sort of similar accent. But let me tell you something, not all "Latinos" are the same. Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latinamerica. You don't say to an Irish he is British or to a Canadian he is American or to a Basque he is Spanish. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture i do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
1504	The only problem with this form of punishment is it does nothing to remove the mental drive of the perpetrator. He will still have the same thoughts. Maybe a combination, frontal lobotomy and castration, will do the trick, but I can't see any State passing this into law. I'm more in favor of the two strikes and your shot approach. Besides, bullets are so much cheaper than surgery.
1505	Wow, that's tough. Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself? This is what I can think of: Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social "harmony" or "balance." Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance. Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion. The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socially cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is. In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.
1506	The bad thing about this, really there are still alot of people that are displaced, looking for jobs (in which our state doesn't have because the economy and crime is so high), and have no permanent place to call home.
1507	As far as an actual statistic, I'm not sure. However, I think that people lie in court all the time. People are either honest or dishonest... I don't think that swearing to tell the truth will automatically want to make a dishonest person want to tell the truth... it just means that if they don't tell the truth when they swore to, then it's illegal. And hey, if they are already on trial for something illegal, it's probably not going to bother them if they do something ELSE that's illegal.
1508	Yes, fight for your rights, and don't give him any sex (charge him, just kidding, had to say that in the moment), the most important thing of course is the welfare of the children, and remember, documentation, documentation, I hope you have paperwork on everything that has happened in your life, and witnesses, he has to pay child support no matter what, he is their father and has to support them (like it or not/wage garnishment). And don't question yourself if you need financial help, you do and you deserve it. Good Luck and I hope things work out for you and your children.
1509	i beleive when you get to a point where you can't move to get something or do something yourself, or have a very hard time doing it,you are too fat. My father weighs 600 lbs and he can't even walk anymore, but it is not a criminal act, although it is one of the seven deadly sins of the bible known as glutiny, no one else can be held responsible for someone eating their selves to death. cause even if someone else is giving them the food, they pretty much have to feed them til they are full or it won't let them rest at all. p.s I am a big guy too. but i am perfectly capable of everything anyone else does with a lot of ease. i work a factory job and work 12 and 16 hrs a day and can't lose weight for the life of me, i don't consume that much food. some people are naturally heavy, and those are the ones that are the most misunderstood.
1510	PUT IT THIS WAY, IF I WALK IN MY HOUSE AND MY ONLY CHILD IS LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR AND I DISCOVER THAT MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE HAS JUST BEEN RUINED BY THE KILLER, AS I WALK IN THE ROOM HE DROPS HIS KNIFE AND TELLS ME HE GIVES UP BECAUSE I HAVE A GUN IN MY HAND. YOUR DAMN RIGHT HE IS GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL THAT NIGHT. WHY SHOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT IF HE GETS CAUGHT SEVERAL MONTHS LATER.
1511	This is not an easy question to answer, since in most states, the answer is not simple. In general, a parent may use "reasonable force" in disciplining a minor child, but what is "reasonable" from one situation to another may greatly differ. For example, the use of force would be more reasonable if an older child is at risk of seriously harming a younger child, than if that older child was simply late for dinner.
1512	Why don't we just legalize murder and fraud and robbery and rape. Smoking Marijuana is illegal and just because millions do it desn't make it right. Millions of people around the world supported the 911 attacks, does that make them right?
1513	well, you see people these days are to busy to see what is going on in the world. I may not know everything, but from what I can see, people are just to stupid to just watch what Bushy (please do not sue me because i just said "Bushy" instead of Bush,I just like the name like that)here is doing. Also, people are sometimes to poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper (or they're just to lazy too) because of taxes, gas prices,and ALL OF THEIR LITTLE STUPID FRIEND!!!!!!!!
1514	Pro. Once a murderer is executed they will NEVER escape and NEVER harm anyone else. It grates on the hearts and minds of the families of the victim that their loved one will never get another holiday, another birthday or even just one more day, with their murderer still alive. It brings a measure of relief to families. There is just something inherently fair about executing a murderer.
1515	This type of question only reinforces the view of anti-gunners about how they view legal gun-owners. Your question should be, "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?" Or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?" See how that's more diplomatic, and more inviting to a thoughtful discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hositlity and open biases into it?
1516	Well, here are a few ways: 1. Don't cover his hate-mongering on the daily news. The whole reason that "church" keeps going is because they get publicity. Complain to TV stations that cover them. 2. If you are at a funeral or event where they are present, either tell them how much their actions hurt and offend you, or stand in front of them with your backs to them. You have the right to do this from the 1st amendment, just like they do. 3. Support organizations, such as PFLAG, who work against discrimination, bigotry and homophobia. Support the same causes yourself. I tried to limit my answer to things an individual can do, vs. staging a counterdemonstration and other things that require lots of people and money. Thanks for your thoughtful question.
1517	I'm still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non smokers have had their non smoking areas with fans, wasn't that enough? I guess not. People just want to dictate what others do so they can get their way. If non a smokers right were seemingly violated they would and do get their way. What about smokers rights?
1518	i think because the entire un was against the war in the 1st place.bush made this stupid meaningless war,it was an unnecessary war! completely! maybe thats why the world is just watching to see the mess the us made & how there trying to fix it. but bush will never admit it was a terrible mistake going there & starting this war....well maybe on his death bed he would. i do agree though,that if all of the world helped,the insurgents & terrorists would be eliminated.but thats not going to happen because i would guess 90% of the world hates the us,especially now.
1519	Or if you,re called a fat@$$ or a b!tch or a sl*t or a whore or a wet-back or a chink or a red-neck..... I mean come on where does it end? It's so stupid. If someone one wants to be racist, then by all means let him be a racist. There are worse things a person could be.
1520	If you're asking for yourself, I'd say that's embarrassing, you want to sue a bar because you got arrested for public intoxication? What did they do? Hold you down and pour tequila down your throat and make you turn into a jerk? I'd love to to sit on that jury...someday I hope you're able to practice some personal responsibility.
1521	in certain situations it would be permissible. for example, if what somebody is doing affects another person or group in a negative way then the government should be allowed to step in. the government works for us as a whole, not each individual person. we are allowed certain freedoms and to do most things the way we want to but there are limits on everything. if protecting society by limiting one person's freedoms is the best plan of action then the government should have every right to do so
1522	I'm having trouble finding anything positive about this decade. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that I have food and shelter and a good job, but I find that there isn't a lot to look positively on. For example, everyone is always buried in their smartphone.
1523	In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Everything in society, such as wealth, income, education, and etc are just there to make our lives appear meaningful. They don't exist in the physical world. Hunter and gatherers don't need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Okay, they may have shorter life expectancy. So what? There's no philosophical explanation on why life has to be long. The fact is that we, civilians, have to create allusions to make our lives content.
1524	Everyone in school has to learn what happend in the past with the argumentation: We have to learn from our mistakes. But why for example are we tolerating dictators when the past showed how awful Hitler was and how he abused his political power? The only thing we are learning is how it was in the past; it might be interesting but it's unnecessary for the further improvement of our life and society. The only thing I see people with a degree in historical studies doing, is teaching younger persons or writing historical texts. I don't understand why it's so highly regarded altough it's all for our enjoyment. I don't think it should be called as an subject in scientific discipline.
1525	If we stay around here for the next 11-12 years it might end up being a dodge charger or a crown vic. It'll have a roof-rack shaped like their siren lights, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram-cage on the front and maybe some numbers in the corner on the back, and maybe the side too. I think writing something close to POLICE on the side would be too far, but the color will be the same and I'll make sure I slap on everything I can. We don't live in a dangerous city/area and we never plan to be anywhere near one, so I don't see him taunting neo-Nazi types messing with him. I think he'll bring intimidation to every neighborhood he goes to and people will drive carefully and slowly around him. CMV?
1526	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry.
1527	As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched. Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the work I think supporting the basic concept of feminism (all human beings should be treated equally regardless of gender) is a no-brainer, but I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. The comments of construction workers don't determine the wage of women, or their ability to participate in American economic or political life. The actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do. So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices? Why do street harassment and terms of address merit more attention than institutional discrimination?
1528	Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects.But lets take a look at the frontmen: Kurt Cobain: Good looking, blonde blue eyed, looks like hansons uncle Eddie Vedder: def above average pretty man Scott Weiland: in his pre anorexia days a very handsome man Chris Cornell: Not so sure...think he is good looking? Ladies? Layne Staley: I think he is probably the least but still not ugly. They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen? I mean even outside of grunge, have you seen younger pictures of Michael Stipe?
1529	I watched the Spider-Man movies (Toby Maguire) probably sound the age of 6 the first time and saw absolutely nothing wrong with them. Watching again 10 years later I though maybe at times Toby could seem a little bit mopey but I don't understand why there is so much aggression toward the actor. He was decent in the great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? People on internet constantly complain about his various faces. I have only notice the one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please elaborate as much as you can on this subject please and thank you.
1530	I'll add some arguments here, but please don't feel obligated to address them point by point. There's plenty of stuff I've probably missed/gotten 1. With the advent of Constantly Variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts - even well driven ones - no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy. 2. The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety. 3. The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term. 4. They are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. 5. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys. 6. They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear. 7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving. Please CMV.
1531	I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusion: I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number which I answered due to the fact that it could have been important. I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person (I can usually tell if its automated). Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though). I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for. I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong. Thanks.
1532	Let's start with the numbers: Arizona Iced Tea (lemon): 24 grams of sugar in 8 oz. Coca-Cola Classic: 27 g Pepsi: 28 g Ingredients: Arizona: tea brewed in filtered water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, lemon flavor. Coke: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, flavors, caffeine. Their first two ingredients are basically identical: water and high fructose corn syrup. Of course, Arizona gets its flavor mostly from tea leaves while Coke gets it from flavoring. They both stain teeth; Coke has caramel color while Arizona again gets it from the tea leaves. I like both drinks, but I feel at this point that they are both pretty terrible at this point and that they should only be used sparingly. CMV.
1533	I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. I find it puzzling how Special Education students (at least in New York) get one or two teachers that personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. However, many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while Special Education students each have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reforming, but if anyone can refute this argument, I'm open to thinking differently.
1534	As far as I can see, they want independence but they want to stay in NATO and the UN, they also want to keep the pound as well as all of the infrastructure that we've (the UK) have built up such as the NHS, military, police, fire services etc. My view at the moment is that if they vote for independence they should get complete independence. A full and immediate cease of all funding from the UK government to Scotland and Scottish nationals, immigration controls, them not being allowed to use the pound, be expelled from the UN/NATO (and have to reapply to join if they wanted to), the immediate withdrawal of the NHS and other services such as British police/fire services and armed forces. At the moment they seem to be like petulant kids that are biting the hand that feeds them. Of course, if this is incorrect I would love to be corrected. I'm not interested in being wilfully ignorant.
1535	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. In my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.
1536	I am generally against the use of the death penalty for moral reasons for practically every reason other than crimes against humanity, as I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I don't think it has moral use for other heinous crimes such as murder or rape in practically every circumstance. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion and so I'm willing to change my mind. I'm hoping to hear something new though, and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.
1537	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act).
1538	I'm wholly against pirating content online. Most people seem to feel it is harmless, since you're stealing from big companies like Fox or EA, but those are just the producers, not the actual company that created the content and deserves the money they worked their asses off to earn. The pirate bay doesn't even attempt to hide that it's soul purpose is to circulate torrented files of copy righted content. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his involvement in both creating the site, and developing methods to make it harder for the site to be taken down is wholly justified.
1539	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "your honor," or "Captain." In certain situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorificstitles. However, it is my position that nobility NEVER deserves to be referred to by their honorifics/titles (King, Queen, majesty, Prince, ect.). Why? (1) Nobility is completely unearned. Nobility is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns their title, a duke does not. (2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society. These two reasons remove all obligation to refer to nobility by their honorifics in any social context.
1540	It's not that our generation puts money over people, its just that our generation has learned from its past that people aren't forever. People die, people leave, people change and most importantly, people can't always be there for you.
1541	Opera is very good. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the least recognition. Take "Speed dial" for example. It puts your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add ons, but it's community is just beginning. Also, it was recently rated very highly in CPU magazine, with its only flaw being it's lack of add ons, which is greatly increasing. Opera will be releasing a new version of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of it's competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
1542	Although I believe both baseball and football are both deeply rooted in America's history, I believe that baseball has to be America's number one pastime. It is with that type of popularity or attention to one specific thing that brings people together. Baseball definitely has to be America's favorite activity, well at least in my book.
1543	I care about it exactly as much as I care about the regular flu, which is to say "not at all." As is so often the case, common precautions such as washing one's hands regularly (with non-antibacterial soap, please!), sneezing into tissues or handkerchiefs, and just plain staying home when you feel sick would go a long way toward ending this "epidemic."
1544	By many of the fundamentalist Muslim's own statements they hate the US because we are not Muslim. There is no rational way to argue against that as it is simple fact that they issue the statements. Whether or not they would be bombing, attacking US interests in the Middle East and elsewhere is more easily arguable because of US support for Israel and meddling in mid-east poliitics.
1545	I am sorry to say this to all u giants fans but this season i think i recall that the eagles won 23-11 or maybe i just cant remeber. Plus with Brian Westbrook and Donovan Mcnabb healthy with their helpers like desean jackson and kevin curtis the offense just wont be stopped nexty season. Also with there dominant defence with people like asante samuel and their new addings its going to be like pick paluza with the eagles. Lastly they have defensive lineman like jeramiah trotter and other people that could kill any quarterback they see.
1546	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most disgusting act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the subjugated individual must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil". However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
1547	Seeing as how I don't believe in the Big Bang theory and I believe God created all per Genesis, I have to say that God created photosynthesis. Although for those of you who disagree, I wonder just how likely it is that you think photosynthesis evolved. Something as complex as that process occurred by evolution/accident? It is things like this that make me wonder why we can't all believe in a supreme creator whether it be God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other god that people choose to worship. It just seems that somebody/something had to design it all at least in the beginning.
1548	Yes, the fix is in just like in boxing and wrestling. Same goes for the NFL because of the billions of dollars in gambling money it generates, ditto for baseball. Let's not forget that all sports are a business first and foremost and entertainment second, they must control their products. Look at the WNBA, now they are allowing sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys and Stern will do the same for the NBA reel soon, the sister league is just an experiment. NASCAR and the Olympics have allowed sponosrs on jerseys. College sports is the biggest revenoo for them too and unlike so called pro sports the atheletes get shafted with very little pay and no contracts which is why they are jumping to the pros fromm hi school.
1549	I dunno... the open platform seems extremely weird. Game producer's will, of course, have a much easier time developing games but I don't see the point to buying one box and then having an "Xbox", "Playstation", and "Nintendo" station for it... the only reason those names exist is because they make their own consoles. The three big competitors in this industry would be strapped to one box... making money off of their interfaces? Compared to third-party producers, the three companies very few games so it seems like there would be a substantial loss of profit for the giants. I want to see the competition, competition is what keeps the hardware advancing and taking everything to next-gen.
1550	Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education was forced to have fees the people in poverty would not by able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper. (it's bad enough as it is). The people in poverty will never learn how to prevent diseases which plague their society, nor other resources to help them live better lives. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate.
1551	Elvis has music known all over the world. He may have died but look at how popular his music is still. You can find Elvis CD's at just about any store that sells music. And even with all this hip hop coming out. Elvis is still being sold. And even to teens and children. Elvis is likable by everyone. And even if someone doesn't like all of Elvis's stuff it is pretty much guaranteed that they know one of his songs.
1552	The processes of the Engineering process category in SPICE are more beneficial for designing or assessing processes of typical projects developing software-intensive systems. SPICE shows the relation of tests to requirements and integration tests to architecture and design much clearer than CMMI. Additionally, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.
1553	Very interesting topic. Yes I think it could reasonably happen. I mean just look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect it has. When Tianamen Square happened there was a reaction all over the world. There were not mass riots but there were really strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports. The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these. I can really see how it might happen.
1554	Trucks are better. Not only are they more useful because you can haul and tow things; but you can also have the power and capability to haul yourself out the ditch that you might accidentally drive yourself into whilst talking on your cellphone. Also; there are many trucks (the Dodge Ram SRT10) that are fast enough to keep up with many cars.
1555	I just wish my President would have specified where the 200 ish prisoners were going to go instead of Guantanamo Bay. If he had, pending where they would go, i would be more inclined to agree. But with the waterboarding incidents that a lot of people call torture and the whole "Its Cuba's property not ours!" business alone, i think the base should stay open. But then, what do I know? I'm only 19 and i've never been to Guantanamo so i don't know the exact happenigns of the place. I've never been in the Armed Forces or personally delt with the terrorists so this opinion of mine isn't based off of much.
1556	I believe it can be justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures. For instance: "But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)....." Surah 9:5 or: "O ye who believe! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him” (Surah 9:123) And while I understand that many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war. Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism. Based on this, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified.
1557	To start off with, Im a newbie at this website, so please be gentle with me. Saga was ahead of its time, that is why it never really took off like Nintendo or Playstation. Saga Dreamcast was the coolest system ever! And it went CDs before any other system. The gamegear system was also awesome and before its time. I would love to see saga make a comeback. And bring Sonic back home where he belongs.
1558	Three debates in one day criticizing my views on upholding convinceme's seriousness. Convinceme is the ONLY administrator for this website. What he says goes. If he wants to post rules condemning or dignifying anything, I will follow them. But he hasn't. He has left us as a community to make our own decisions. I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community. If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it. I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve. I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions.
1559	The credit goes to the troops. yes i know obama signed off on it( which i guess you can screw up in that respect as clinton has osama in his croos-hairs but chose not to fire) but besides that he had no involvment in it. But people say this is a victory for obama, it is not, nor is it a victory for bush, democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives, but rather a victory for the U.S military and the american people.
1560	I loathe Vegas but can't avoid it for work. It's restaurants like Mesa that make it bearable for me.
1561	We are staying at Paris hotel the first morning we had our breakfast here the food tastes good and the guy that served us was friendly and helpful so the following morning we did not hesitate eating breakfast here again. Unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us was not friendly and helpful at all! They have dish that are not on the menu this guy mumbles those dish that are unfathomable, gave us a lukewarm coffee and after he served the food no follow up if we need anything, i have to ask a coffee refill from the guy clearing the other table. The food was good but the second waiter we had was a total let down.
1562	Been here a few times. It's very popular, but I can't figure out exactly why. Service is slow, food quality iffy, not much flavor in the things I've had. And the place is very noisy when full. So I'm sorry but am not impressed. The dishes I've had include marginal hummus with pita not cooked enough, a dry bean burger, and a spicy chicken wrap that was dry and lacked flavor actually.
1563	My coworkers kept on raving about this place so I had to go check it out. Maybe my tastes are just different, but I wasn't all that impressed. Apparently the place has won awards for it's Thanksgiving themed turkey sandwich, which I got, but I found the sandwich to be passable - nothing spectacular. Food was decent, service was so-so, and I think everything was a tad overpriced. I mean if you're tired of the normal chains like Subway, Quizno's, etc... going to a "mom and pop" shop like this one may break the monotony, but this one is actually a chain too...
1564	One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had! Our food order was lost somehow and after 2 hours, we finally received our food. Management was very accommodating and comped our meals, but then said that the gift cards I was using would not allow them to use the last 10.00 on each of them, and they needed another 30.00, unknown to us was the fact that they had already taken all of the money off the gift cards. So they actually stole 30.00 from us. No way to prove it, but be careful if you use a gift card. I will be letting all of my friends know about this!
1565	If you have read some of the other reviews you'll see that service is an issue. Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday. The staff were all young. I did not see anyone who appeared to be older than 22 years of age. Perhaps they need someone older with some customer experience?? The food was great. The bok choy was outstanding. However, we did not find them to be all that spicy. The 3 stars is for the service. 5 stars would be for the food. We'll return here but allow a little more time to pay the tab since they are slow at cashing out. So, if you have a certain time available to you for lunch you may not want to dine here.
1566	I like fried fish so gave it a try. Don't bother. It is a cheap meal for sure but not good. Think frozen fish square on a bun. I got the deluxe which added mayo, lettuce and tomato. No tarter which is incredibly stupid as it may have salvaged the bland sandwich. Especially since they barely put on any mayo. Won't be back.
1567	School uniforms are a bad idea because kids won't be able to show their color.
1568	Very Very bad!! Though I know I'm going to miss the days to wear a uniform!! So when I'm a student I hate wearing uniforms and when I'm a college student I MISS wearing their uniform!!:d
1569	I have always maintained that it is a good idea to wear a uniform to school. Why not? because it looks very nice and respectful. This shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a schoolgirl, and brought up.
1570	Really great arguments why IE is supposed to be a better browser... hmmm!
1571	Cool skins that let me pimp my browser and a built in spell check along with everything else that IE provides. Can't beat it.
1572	IE sucks and makes development harder, i just can't stand doing separate stylesheets for IE
1573	No I would not turn them in, because it would be to weird for me to turn them in to the police. I would probably wouldn't tell anybody. I would hope that the police catch them but I would not say anything. I would tell them to turn themselves in.
1574	All TV shows are written down as scripts (a form of book) first...
1575	Books are better than TV because books have each and every detail briefly. we get to read books like story books, fairy tales, ghost stories etc these books help us in bringing imaginary power in us. In TV only some points are explained and sometimes we cant remember it easily but in books if we forget anything we can now and then read it.At last I only want to tell that books are much and much better than TV.
1576	Having a bad father does not just leave bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child.
1577	I rather be fatherless then having a bad father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.
1578	I think it is better to be fatherless because a bad father cannot do anything for the family. Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you always feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.
1579	Before leaving Singapore, Raffles left some plans and policies that were important for the development of Singapore.
1580	the definition of founder discussed in class that day that founder was not the person who discovers the place but he is the key in the development of the place and raffles came to singapore and established it on a global level...although it may have been farquhar who suggest this to raffles
1581	porn is wrong..... it's wrong 'cause it's not any good. if it were REALLY good, then it would REALLY be wrong.
1582	Biblically, yes it is wrong. But aside from that, it can become an addiction that destroys lives just like drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.
1583	hells yeah porn is wrong. i mean wtf film naked girls to publicly distribute it on the internet so jerk off's can jack off to them. porn is only here because it makes so much money and dumb people are buying into it. if it's not wrong then try watching it in front of your family, friends or the younger youth. yeah you would feel uncomfortable and you know why? because of common sense and our conscience deep inside we know it's wrong.
1584	What do you see in porn? -> sex What is sex for? -> baby making why should you watch others make a baby? -> pleasure what causes pleasure? -> temptation what do you do to control temptation? -> then do it... conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there is temptation to increase the population of the next generation...
1585	you cannot argue with the theory of creatoinism without getting into an extreamly dumb argument because anybody who believes in creatoinism who is arguing with anyone who doesn't can say that god makes them think what they think TAKE A HINT EVERYBODY THIS ARGUMENT IS MORONIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1586	IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a security context that has minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are internet facing apps with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
1587	YES, because some children do not understand anything expect physical education, especially rich children of rich parents.
1588	Raffles came and left Singapore, returning after a long period of time. Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
1589	Faruhar carried out the 'grand plan' of Raffles, but Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the operation, Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today.
1590	William made the initiative to understand the locals and to communicate with them. He even learnt Malay so as to make conversation easier.
1591	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.
1592	sabrejimmy, I have not tried to prove anything. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
1593	Peppered moths is the ultimate straw man. The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. That however doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.
1594	Radiometric dating can be done in many ways. Today there are over 40 different techniques to do it. The fact they are independent, observable, and falsifiable that makes them scientific rigor. I would recommend going tohttp://www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html for more information on radiometric dating.
1595	Porn kills nobody. It's a profitable source of entertainment for some. Can somebody really tell me what's wrong with it without imposing their moral standards into the argument?
1596	I don't feel degraded by porn. You don't like it? Don't watch it. There are more important jobs in life than to be my personal morality police.
1597	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.
1598	i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.
1599	It is better to have a bad father because; when it comes to a father he is not only a provider but also a protector. Almost every father is bad because they go out and work without giving much time to their children. Some children grow up without a father but think that they had a father, in any shape or form.
1600	I say lousy, if by lousy you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad. However, if pops is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc... Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.
1601	There are direct links to drinking bottled water and certain types of disease, including cancer.
1602	tv is far superior due to its wider variety of thing to do and some people say that tv is incontinent but now you can watch tv on a smart phone witch is very convenient
1603	A picture is worth a thousand words. TV lets you see and hear a story, or information. Imagine just reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama and Missouri vs. seeing them and seeing interviews with survivors. Much more powerful and immediate on TV. Books take too much time. TV gives the info much faster.
1604	Without TV actors/actresses wouldn't have jobs. Without TV you wouldn't know what's happening around the world. I mean the newspapers can't fit all that in. Books and newspapers can't give you emergency warnings or updates or new flashes
1605	Western Europe consumes almost 50% of the world's bottled water. Some claim that this is due to European culture, since the continent has had very polluted waters due to agriculture and industry dating back to the Industrial Revolution. The water bottles they buy help us.
1606	craig is a hypocrite with bottled water and should not be taken seriously
1607	bottled water is not bad for the world because after youre done drinking your bottle of water you can re-use it several times to have serval bottles of water using less plastic. plastic is also recyclable and can make new objects such as more plastic bottles so technically you can re-use and re-use the same plastic bottle over and over again. it will not be bad for the economy if we figure out how to reuse properly.
1608	In 2006, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together to develop a set of National School Beverage Guidelines. This was prepared to reduce the calories delivered to schools by beverage companies and in return promote healthier school choices for children.
1609	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
1610	Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, not.
1611	homosexuals are overrated. it is another "look at me" stunt. i think homosexuals are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (it should be a disease). if you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1612	I'm an avid christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.
1613	ooooooooh really David then why people from your country knock their doors in India for gaining peace and get rid of depression,why does most of the named firms of the world have highest no. of Indian employees cuz we are genius,and we are actually intellectually superior.in past we have lead the world and we'll surely lead the world again in near future wait and watch
1614	India has the potential to lead the world. Full of natural resources, filled with highly spiritual people and country with diverse tounges and races. India has the potential to flourish.
1615	aah...u r saying like that only india has this things.....other countries donot have this.....does the america which seems as leading the world doesnt have bad qualities.....it eats less and waste more.....the amount of food they waste can be utillised for feeding whole indian population...it produces more pollution and blame us...what about it!!!!!!!
1616	INTELLIGENT DESIGN THEORY IS A FORM OF CHRISTIANITY MASQUERADING AS SCIENCE, BUT THERE IS NO REAL SCIENCE BEHIND INTELLIGENT DESIGN.
1617	Religion in the past has caused many wars. It encourages racism, sexism and homophobia. It is something that gives us prejudice. It makes us hate one another.
1618	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.
1619	Yes so they can give the children a reason not to do it again.
1620	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. However, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
1621	It's acceptable for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.
1622	Atheists rely on proof even though they have none... So if my religion has no proof then that gives your religion proof? That doesn't make sense. Where atheists have nothing to back themselves up with, when Christians do, and the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do the atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.
1623	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.
1624	Some kids don't learn by being spanked, so why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.
1625	I say yes i would because no matter what nothing should make you kill any one, how are you going to kill someone and say it was a mistake.thats not right. I dont care what nobody say if it was a mistake or not.
1626	I would turn him in because it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person then what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.
1627	In this situation it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then YES I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
1628	I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So for doing a wrong and to become better you have to take your consequence's.
1629	Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. Basicly no one is above the law.
1630	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to get an abortion or not. However, if people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Have the baby and put them up for adoption. Otherwise people are going to abuse their power to chose and will be killing children because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
1631	One word: Adoption There is absolutely no reason to receive an abortion when you could continue through to birth and then put the child up for adoption. This is a commonly ignored fact in the abortion debate, but I think it is by far the best choice.
1632	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
1633	That situation is very rare and can usually be countered with a contraceptive drug if the woman seeks medical attention after the assault
1634	Core classes are more important, because kids should be more focused on learning, and the competitiveness can cause bullying.
1635	phy. ed is just another class, students should start to be responsible for their actions by the time they are in highschool. if they are responsible with a car, then they should be responsible with their health. the tax payers also dont realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the whole hour.
1636	if students so not have a physical education class then the obesity rate will go even higher than what it is now. that one of the reasons why also physical education reduce heart failure, improved physical fitness, weight reduction, self dicipline, and also stress reduction.
1637	Why does it matter? If two people regardless of gender love each other to the point of which the two marry, shouldn't that follow what the bible really teaches us. All you bible nutjobes by the way are making me sick. The bible teaches love and forgiveness, and lets not forget dont judge others before you judge yourself.
1638	Just beacuse they are gay does not mean that they dont have a right to be happy! how would you feel if you were denied! we live in the 21st centy! everyone else is allowed to get married so why should not they!
1639	It might be against the teachings of the bible etc... but only because a gay relationship bears no offspring which is why it was banned. Also it was seen to weaken the position of men. Time have changed... its time to accept.
1640	I believe personal pursuit is better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching your goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach and succeed their goals.
1641	I feel like it is better to do both, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal goals before you can help others.
1642	Although we have free speech in America if our speech incites a riot or if it is reasonable to assume that what you say could incite others to do harm or break the law then there can be legal repercussions. The reason this so seldom happens though is because it has to be proved that the actions of others were the direct and sole result of the words or actions of another and this can be hard to do.
1643	If it proves to be true, assuming we're talking about a reasonably short time-frame here, then you're probably okay. But it also depends on "how" you say what you say. The facts are one thing, but if you selected a hurtful way of conveying the message, it could be viewed as an unjustified verbal assault - and depending on the circumstances, that could be actionable.
1644	Prostitutes have been abused growing up at home. It seems like they already don't like themselves very much. They know they can be murdered any time and they seem to still do it. It's an issue of being stuck in a bad life for them. The money they make pays for the drugs they use to blank out their minds as to what they are doing to themselves. There are some who get out of it.
1645	Strangely enough in New Zealand the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the intengenous people. Despite the treaty not being recognised at international law. There have been a number of other treaties established during the colonising period, which if New Zealand is precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally I am in the view that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that has been a corner stone of international law. I think that if Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of Kings peace. I think there would be a indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today.
1646	I think by your name you may be a Marine. Crimes are crimes, and some, can be forgiven with hard work and a real change. I am an NCO and I have seen troops grow up and take their duty and the rules seriously. You can change, even if you get discharged. You can ALWAYS choose the right path, just hope it is not to late, like for Tookie Williams.
1647	Since it has been 8months I doubt you will get anywhere with it. Not only that you have to prove that they knew about the damage...the court doest side on just assumptions. If I would you next time you buy a used car take it some place and get it looked over. If the dealer wont allow it have the look it over and sign off that there is no damage. If you dont like this answer I would seek legal help!
1648	What you describe is sad, and the system we have devised. The courts are the best that human beings have come up with so far in the history of the planet, but they are far from perfect and mistakes happen all the time. As you point out, public "pretenders" are anything but helpful. What is important is to not quit, ever. Even while imprisoned, a person can use his or her wits, and study the law and work actively on the appeal. Deadlines are critical. Bad things happen to good people. And life is anything but fair. Instead of focusing on what happened, sometimes all a person can do is look to the future and make the best of every day.
1649	The bill should pass, this is a country of law which is be ruled by law. There should be no way for anybody to break those laws because they want to survive?
1650	It really can't in a common law jurisdiction. The concept of common law is that valid decisions/interpretations by courts are binding authority on lower courts. So, it can't be illegal for courts to do what they are designed to do. Civil law systems (such as France, or Lousisana) work differently, and there the court holdinds are not binding in the same way as under common law.
1651	I always make sure my checks are not printed on rubber. they are just too expensive and not worth it. We all make a mistake from time to time, and usually it is no big deal except for the extreme annoyance and all the bounced check fees. But if you are worried about an arrest warrant then I am sure you are doing this deliberately and trying to defraud the company. You have probably sent them a couple of bad checks already in an attempt to string them along so your guilt is probably pretty well established. You can hope that you do not have to share a jail cell with a gross deviate of some sort.
1652	It is legal, since there is no overtime for salaried employees. However, there is one caveat however, minimum wage law still applies even to salaried employees, so calculate how many hours you work each year then divide your salary by that number -- if the result is less then federal minimum wage(5.15) or your states minimum wage (7.63 being the maximum in Washington) or even your local minimum wage (9.50 in Santa Fe) then your employer is in violation of the law.
1653	Web Master has a point. Not only is it unethical, it resembles the workings of Stalin during the Cold War. But this isnt too unusual. HE seems to make bad and at that HORRIBLE descisions in the oval office, starting with rigging the election. This is a catastrophe, and it doesnt surprise me that his idea of public safety is ruining, ending, and controlling the lives of his citizens, letting the REAL bad guys reign havoc, and be done in time to kill some more of his own people and innocent civilians elsewhere.
1654	Police brutality exists in the U.S. for the simple fact that, they do not give proper screening of individiuals before they give them a badge and gun. They give these gung-ho I-can-do-whatever guys who think they can get away with it cause Im a cop people a job. Also, factor in the race card, because most of the cases are white on black crimes. They fear the black man so they automatically resort to violence to solve the issue. It sickens me that they allow them to get away with it. This country prides itself on freedom, what about the freedom to walk or drive and not have to worry about the people who are supposed to be protecting you. Stop Racism, stop police brutality. And this is being written by a white man, so dont think im a complaining Black man.
1655	please it is president Clinton, and though people are going to say it is just politics it is the same issue. if it is wrong now it was wrong then. if anything there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans. people are screaming about an illegal war can not remember president Clinton asking congress for any wars he got us in. but you have president Bush who did go to congress.
1656	yes and most of them are hypocrites. our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. the whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. we watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, (we followed), but how can you fight it?
1657	The death penalty is not revenge. Instead that, it is the punishment assigned a person after having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers. There are laws that determine what crimes and under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted. This may not be a matter of "revenge" by the state - but might felt so by the victim's family.. In some states, most prisoners only get life imprisonment without any opportunity for parole.
1658	Not unless (A) you are a licensed real estate broker and (B) you have a pre-existing written agreement to do so signed by every estate beneficiary from whose interest the commission would be paid. As a P.R. you CAN seek additional P.R. fees for extra services to the estate involving sale of real estate that either the beneficiaries expressly consent to in writing or that a court allows on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on such factors as additional time and liability over & above the routine duties of a P.R., not on a percentage of the sale price -- which would constitute a commission.
1659	That bunch of cells could instrumental in saving millions of lives,stem cell research. What about my right to live?.The best medicine should be available to every body, but perhaps procedures/treatments that arise from stem cell research could be optional. i.e.'Miss smith you have cancer we can cure it, but the treatment comes from stem cell research.Would you like the treatment or would you prefer to die painfully?,and would you like fries with that?.
1660	Get a new boyfriend. He seems to not be able to change or want to change. Driving on a suspended driver's license is a serious misdemeanor. He can't seem to follow the simple rules to get himself out of trouble. He was sent to rehab to give him another chance and he messes it up. Simultaneously he gets caught driving on a suspended license. If they find out about the driving violation and being kicked out of rehab, he may face some jail time. I highly suggest you separate from him, it is going downhill fast. I know you are dedicated to him, but give that dedication to someone who has a chance at doing something instead of doing time. Just get out of his way or you will be joining him.
1661	The person above is absolutely wrong. Property is property. He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage. His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business, the government cannot take it away just because he is here illegally. But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he doesn't pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status. The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes. So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills.
1662	Not every download is copyright infringement. If someone has legal ownership of a work (as its creator/author), then they are perfectly entitled to grant permission for anyone else to make copies and distribute them. Also, many works are either public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement (such as non-commercial use only). These are again not in volation of copyright laws. So, there are plenty of legal ways that software like limewire can be used. And as long as there are legal uses, and as long as the software maker doesn't intend or support illegal use to occur -- the software itself is not illegal. But using it to make unlawful copies is still illegal.
1663	The idea of "You can't get an ID without an ID". Try to explain this to them and ask THEM for their opinion on your situation. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction. I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. SO, we just asked the DMV what we should do? They suggested official school records, you request them and keep them sealed and let the DMV open them. They just want to make sure it's you.
1664	You are either very young or new to this country. If you have money or you are famous, you can buy whatever judgement or law that you want enacted. If you are poor then you are just out of luck. Lawyers will not take your case unless it means very big money for them. Even if you are totally in the right unless they can make a huge profit they will not touch it. So, repeat after me. Money equals privilage under the law. Poverty equals nothing. Save yourself a lot of time and learn it now.
1665	Conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of the status quo, of stability. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat. Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.
1666	Sorry, wrong, gorgeousleepingwalli. Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison. (You have to actually read the stuff you Google before you jump to a conclusion and post an answer here.) Although she is listed as the first female to be executed by electrocution, on 3/20/1899. Although Louisiana has executed several women, the first by electric chair was Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/42....64 years ago today....good question considering the date today...
1667	If the judge couldn't hear her clearly then I think he has every right to ask for the person in question to remove her veil. If the woman who is a lawyer could not be understood in court then she is not doing her job properly due to the presence of her veil and the judge could not do his job properly either. I can only respect for asking for the veil to be removed, I mean it isn't for very long and she was fighting for someone in court! We're in Britain here where the covering your face is seen as suspicious, these women really need to think about the message the veil puts across about them and their religion.
1668	I do not believe that terrorists should be given equal rights. I do believe that they shold be treated as humans though. If they can't be peaceful, then they shouldn't be allowed to walk the streets. If they cannot be reformed, and they continue to even be disrectful, NO government should allow that! Terrorism is costing lives and well as tax dollars. I wouldn't think it was a bad thing if they were executed for their crimes! It might sound harsh, but think of how many lives it would potentially save!
1669	i'm not sure, but ask if there's a youth court or teen court system you can go through. those are systems where teenagers learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. typically if you go through teen court you end up doing community service and the offense doesn't stay on your record... my one preachy moment: drink if you wanna drink, but don't ever ever EVER drink and drive. it's stupid and inexcusable.
1670	It's not the reaction times -- it's the crime itself you're punished for.
1671	not only that.. she can pretty much just decide shes bored with the marriage and take off with the kid.. force you to sell your house.. and move in with joe-shmoe whos ten times richer than you while forcing you to pay her... the laws need to be changed... no way should a parent be able to just throw in the towel on a whim and leave with the kids... if they want to leave without a judgement that the spouse their leaving is dangerous, an adulterer, or mentally... then they should leave empty handed period...
1672	No it is definately not. There are several rules governing what you can and cannot do to the flag (assuming you are talking about the greatest and prettiest flag in the world - Old Glory). Check the site below to see them. FYI - Bushy Bush desecrated an American flag by signing his name to it for a "fan" (I call fans of Bush "traitors"). He is thereby a traitor to this country, and should be tried and condemned as such. Just my thoughts on the subject. Can you tell I didn't vote for him?
1673	I really feel for you, thats a tough situation. Are you sure that you are really in love with him, as you only said that you believe you are in love with him. Be careful not to confuse other feelings for love. Did you know he was your uncle before you got involved? I know you fall in love with who you fall in love with but there is a brief window in which you can apply the breaks. What about the other woman he is with? Has he spoken to her yet? If I were you, I would try to steer clear and if he manages to end the relationship with the other lady and keep his relationship with the kids maybe you could think about him again. I don't know about the law and deformities. I would say no to both questions, but just think of the people involved in this tangled web and how your decisions will effect them Its tough I know. Good luck.
1674	well i think you know what it is and are probably trying to grow it from the way you are talking. marijuana seeds dont fly out of birds. any idiot knows what mj looks like just from the leaf, yeah you can get in trouble for cultivation, not that much if you only have one plant and claim you dont know what it is. they wont believe you anyway. you wont get caught, if the cops find out then your friends really arent your friends.
1675	Using illegal drugs regardless of your condition or sex is criminal. However, a more severe punishment should be imposed on a woman who would subject her baby to illegal drugs or alchohol. Sure, I would entertain the idea of institutionalizing the mother until the birth if she is using illegal drugs....after that, she should go to prison. The problem is, who is going to pay for that? That's right, the taxpayer. Accountability is the number one lacking quality amoung many Americans today. The fact that we as a society tolerate stupidity and irresponsibilty, is enabling these people to continue making poor desisions, having children, doing drugs...etc. Until we hold people accountable and responsible for their actions, there is no real solution. Good luck and take care.
1676	Not likely. Even with the new Chief Justice and Associate Justice, it is not likely that the court will mess with existing precident. Hopefully, though, the court will see fit to uphold such things as bans on late-term, will require parental notification for teenagers, and will require these "doctors" to become required reporters of abuse like all other medical professionals.
1677	Why not? People complain it is against God. so those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays. MAN makes these rules and uses God as an excuse. There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you hear anyone complaining? Anyway marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain. atheists get married. what's the big deal? all the people who think this is a sin, would leave the "sinners" alone, after all isn't it their God's job to judge them? and to "punish". They do believe their God gave them "free will" don't they?
1678	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math science or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be there own unique awesome person, advancing human towards the next step in our history. Please cmv!
1679	Saying you belong to a political ideology makes you dogmatic. Society is dynamic and can't go by the principles of one political ideology. Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard.
1680	I'm in my 20's, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow (which costs between a third of a million dollars to $800,000 just to transplant my marrow that I'm giving away for free) and, while I'm on the list, I'd jump at the chance to sell it. I'm positive I could sell my liver for at LEAST 100k to a rich alcoholic who couldn't get on the transplant list, and if I'm not allowed to, it shouldn't be allowed to use that as a defense of abortion. The medical industry is making money hand over fist and I want a piece of it. If women have the "right" to abortion because of their "right" to bodily autonomy, I should have the "right" to sell my marrow and organs because of my "right" to bodily autonomy.
1681	I think the proof is in the pudding: take something you consider yourself truly knowledgable about and look at the news coverage. You'll find it partial at best. You'll encounter people who "read an article" related your field and understand how naive they sound. Journalists can only provide so much context and it's usually never enough to give a layperson a foothold in the subject matter. This is not to say that news isn't valuable. But it does mean that if you read the paper every day and gravitate toward the Ukraine stories while having virtually no historical background, having never been to the Ukraine or Russia, never done any research or met people from the cultures involved, you should speak, think and feel with in an extremely humble tone about the subject. In fact it would be more wise to ask questions than to profess any opinion at all.
1682	Of course, stop if a train is there. But, I think that stopping, listening for a train, and going again is much riskier than not stopping at train crossings. I feel this way for 3 reasons: 1. If your engine stalls or you have some other kind of problem as you are crossing the tracks, you no longer have momentum to carry you to safety. 2. The act of stopping could cause another vehicle to crash into you because they are not expecting it. 3. If for some reason you stop but don't actually hear/see a train coming for any reason (unlikely, but still a possibility), you are now on the tracks for a much longer period of time, increasing your risk. I think that the safest option is just approach level crossings like every other vehicle on the road. CMV
1683	- Lobbying is prohibited. No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are absolutely fine. - Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means. The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question. This also means that outsiders can't influence who gets voted by donating toward a certain candidate. I haven't given this a whole lot of thought, this actually occurred to me only 5 minutes ago. This is too simple to be without flaws, so I'm looking for counterarguments. I am also not American, so I do not fully understand how your political system works. I hope this doesn't sound too stupid.
1684	So, little about me is I'm currently a 19 year old male enrolled in college. I plan on majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. In terms of intimate relationships, I have never kissed a girl, nor asked one out. Part of it is that I know they will say no. I'm not an attractive person by any means, I'm very fat and have very poor hygiene. And even, if by some miracle they said yes, the relationship would not last longer than a day at most. I consider myself to be a weird dude. I have weird songs on my iPod and I watch weird videos and have no hobbies other than playing video games, browsing the internet, and watching movies/TV. I feel that a person like me isn't really meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any sorts. I feel that I have to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.
1685	There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Alladin. But then there was lion king.
1686	A pretty simple google search will result in many horror stories surrounding lottery winners. Many are forced to move from their home towns, face lawsuits from people looking for a quick buck from a deep pocket, and even have a much higher chance of being murdered. I feel that it should be a person's right to choose whether they want the public to know about their winnings.
1687	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his shits in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system. They are a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness. I think for any major city to develop faster, it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. I think homeless people should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way major downtown areas could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy.
1688	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around 2 hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until 24th July, or offering to change bookings to a later date. I now have doubts about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysia Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure. In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund.
1689	Bungies next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, but I don't see how it's going to be such a revolutionary game. Frankly, it looks like Borderlands with a different setting and tone. But otherwise it's a solid looking FPS that focused on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas. How is this so revolutionary? I mean the setting looks good, and I like the idea of an epic quest across the solar system in my trusty spaceship, but the revelation of the ships not being flyable and there being no space combat -they're just cut scene machines- was a big disappointment for me. Please, I want to be more excited for this game than I am. But it's being hailed as the next big new thing in gaming and I just don't see it.
1690	I am Canadian by birth but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I found this was a good thing and clung onto it myself for a time but discovered I don’t need to define myself by a single (or two or three) nationality/nationalities. From what I have seen, particularly with people who have moved from their mother country and settled permanently elsewhere, it only seems to lead to bigotry and a stagnation of one's own cultural and personal development. To be Serbian or Croatian or Indian or Saudi Arabian or whatever seems to be interpreted as boldly representing the country’s main religion, beliefs, traditions, etc. at the time that the person left that country. Why can't we accept our differences and that we as people have a developing cultural identity, and not see this as “losing” our identity? The fear of losing this causes people to ignorant and bigoted.
1691	I think kids owe their parents everything because the parents brought them into this world and gave them life and kept them fed and sheltered and relatively healthy during their childhood. Kids should stay at home (or as close to home as possible) for their entire lives, so that in case a parent has any need at all, the kids can drop what they're doing and help the parents, because they owe them their lives. I believe that kids don't know what they're doing, ever, and that parents always know better than their kids.
1692	Men such as I, don't have half the balls to make a pass at a woman, let alone the balls to ask a woman on a date. All the things SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about is something that most men don't do. It's massively a stereotype. Anecdotal evidence is not a clear indicator of "oppression" that's blown out of proportion. In many cases, men don't even get half a chance. For example, Women claim equal rights, but don't even pursue a man because social norms claim they are to be pursued.
1693	I think the japanese need to protect themselves a lot better against China. The chinese are becoming stronger both in their economy and military, and i'm sure they have plenty of generals just aching for payback from all the atrocities commited by the japanese in ww2. And the japanese won't even acknoledge the genocide in the same way germany does with the Holocaust, that's just rubbing salt in the wound. On the other side, i know japan is being protected by american forces, but how much can they trust on the US? Would the US go to war with China over Japan? (Or South Korea for that matter) I think it won't happen, and in a tight spot, they would just choose to abandon those allies.
1694	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a change to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a person, but given at birth by parents. Why should this unearned, pre-decided trait determine the scholarship a student receives? I believe that all scholarships should be merit-based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill "race quotas" to "diversify the campus" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.
1695	I understand the democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I understand as a union guy that our dues are paltry, and the Teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
1696	I'm not sure what the popular view on reddit is about this, but in the real world, I hear arguments from both sides of the political spectrum regarding what the founding fathers would have thought. I don't really think it matters because the founding fathers were not gods who could prepare for any problem or know everything, they were just people. We live in a different time than the founding fathers, and even if we didn't, it isn't like the founding fathers were infallible. I'm not saying the founding fathers were always wrong, but I don't think a view deserves any more merit just for being the view of one of the founding fathers.
1697	I've long struggled with this and I'd like to hear some strong arguments from the other side.
1698	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is a healthy body type that people have naturally. Fat isn't healthy. Curvy women don't fit into the "skinny" category because of their assets, but also aren't an unhealthy weight. I feel that it is unfair and misleading to actual curvy women for fat women to use the descriptor curvy. That being said I have nothing against someone for being overweight.
1699	So creationists like to argue that evolution is wrong and creationism is correct. Yet the fossil record shows that ancient clams are in layers below giant land sloths. If all organisms lived at the same time, how did a giant land sloth which moves at 1 mph or less manage to outright and outlive an organism that thrives in water during a global water flood? It seems to me that such a question is preposterous and that the flood never occurred.
1700	Reality TV is garbage... First of all it is scripted... just meant for amusment and it is not really reality. People live vicarously through reality tv shows. Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative manner. For example, the bachelor, teaches our young teenage girls that we have to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different women to get their attention to have a fairy land wedding, that is not reality. Also, many of the reality shows, such as rock of love, flavor flav, demean women in a sense and this is what our children grow up watching.
1701	I'm embarrassingly ignorant on the status of this project so perhaps some of you kind souls can fill me in. I'm wholly convinced that a useful stipped-down laptop can be manufactured for less than $100. When travelling, I was always issued this super-handy Asus EEE which cost about $300 USD. I'm also wholly convinced that access to information infrastructure is an essential part of nation-building, but Microsoft Powerpoint is not. (In fact, that inspires a new debate topic!) Perhaps somebody can clarify for me, will these laptops have access to the internet?
1702	yes. Friends come and go over time. but i have lived in the same house as my family my whole life. they have been the most constant presences in my entire life. more than that we all share the same blood. we look alike, and have similar strengths and principles. even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. i am more connected to my family then to any other creatures on this planet.
1703	I'm not entirely sure if the creator of this debate had a specific event in mind when they posted it but I'm willing to take part regardless.
1704	I would say before..........I have never been married but have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw so I will consider it the same thing. As far as sex comes it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage/long term commitment. It seems when your new all your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new/ different. After a long time having sex with the same person the quanity and quality both began to subside. It seems after a long time it seems like a routine with less experimentation same positions, same girl, same everything....I find the excitement of having sex with someone much better, constantly being turned on not being able to keep your hands off each other.
1705	Well let's take a look at the facts, shall we? Known for holding extremist Islamic views? Check. Shouted Allahu Akbar during his attack? Check. Ties to extreme Islamic terrorists? Check. Expressed hatred of infidels? Check. Frequently went to Jihadi web sites? Check. The man was clearly an Islamic Extremist and this was clearly a terrorist attack. The better question would be: Why can't we admit it?
1706	Death should be celebrated as a part of life. The empty vassal you see is a reminder of what the person was, not what they are or even what the deceased was to everyone around them. funerals just remind everyone that the dead will no longer be what they were to their survivors. its selfish, celebrate the dead, everything about them, remember and be happy. Dont mourn over your loss, celebrate their life.
1707	we r not talking about killing for fun rather about putting the animal out of its misery so ur argumnt isnt relevant. what we are saying is wirh animals it isnot worth much to put a sick animal through an ordeal just so its mate wont pine for it. with humans the case is different. besides the emotional trauma which is much more complex in a human than in an animal seeing as we r much more complex beings, humans bear a responsibility to those around them their wives n especially kids who depend on parents not only for food but for education among other numerous things. reptiles on the other hand desert their offspring as soon as the eggs hatch. a snake will eat its own eggs if it cant find the food.
1708	I'm actually not sure you can. You see, since video games and movies are all we really have to go on, is it truly possible to kill that which is already dead? we don't really know. I think that if something possessed the undead to come back to the land of the living, I don't think we will truly be able to kill them off, since they are dead to begin with, and not be able to be killed by our normal means.
1709	Yes and no. Art is art, and that is true. If in the correct area i.e. one's nieghborhood, night club etc. It's part of the culture and a good thing. But no because if it is defacing public buildings, historical sites, bridges in public areas and otherwise beautiful landmarks of the city, it is wrong. Those things are intended to look professional.
1710	Runes were discovered magicaly after Odin hung from Ygdrassil the world tree for 9 days, in his agony and delirium he saw visions of runes on the ground below him him. Runes were originally symbols with magical properties and later they evolved into a kind of writing system
1711	Animal testing should be allowed (under strict conditions) until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing. Those strict conditions should include: a suitable habitat for the animal, a decent diet, no cruel treatment, and only for certain, specified diseases or malaises. For example, they should not use animal testing for products such as make-up or perfume, but if they are testing a drug that may be a cure for cancer, animal testing is possibly the best route to take, as it is cheap and yet one of the most effective tests available.
1712	Not at all because everyone's sense of morality is different. Thus, for example, if a pro-choicer was engaged in an abortion debate, the pro-lifer could call them moraless all they want but still not change the fact that the pro-choicer has valid points. Indeed, in many cases, morality is extremely subjective and thus saying that someone "lacks morality" is about as valid an argument as "you suck".
1713	Isn't barely helping better than not helping? And if I am going to buy an iPod either way, isn't it better to buy a red one that sends even a tiny fraction of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green one that goes better with my wardrobe but doesn't raise money for anyone but Apple? Gestures like those Livestrong bracelets are weak, but when it's something you were already going to buy (read: NOT a stupid-looking rubber bracelet), I think that having a philanthropic option is refreshing--even if it's just a LITTLE philanthropic. The previous options weren't at ALL philanthropic. If it's no worse and it's not the same, odds are it's, well, a little better.
1714	bad company is boring its hard to kill people on there and the controls are weird the vehicles are boring and are hard to control for some reason also the maps are to big.on cod the map called wastland is one of the biggest and people hate that map.mw2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering whats about to come from around that corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head or if your about to get hit by a thrown grenade but through all that that goes through your mind as your playing you get hit from behind and your down.battlefield is boring because you always no where the enemy is and you dont have to go get them you can just drive around being bored and the maps are to big to go out of your way to kill someone unlike on mw2 your thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to developed.plus weapons on mw2 are realistic except for the at4 which is not a guided munition.
1715	School uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights because of what they are wearing, but that's just us high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we wouldn't notice who's who, and we would still get made fun of. I believe that school uniforms are just another way for the government to get money.
1716	Valet fees $16 for first 2 hours. Hotel claims People are using parking for airport bullshit. They cost share with the valet so no need to tip I guess at that cost. Disgusting with all the bad press this place has. The Venetian doesn't charge for Valet. They are so greedy at Mandalay Bay. It's the MGM corporation in general. All their hotels are doing this. Found out that if you park at the shopping center valet at Mandalay it's free. Sounds silly to rant about this. The casinos just rip everything off. So flood the mall parking.
1717	The food was ok, nothing special. The portions are huge but I don't think that matters to me since I don't make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.
1718	Last second find...Not what expected in a grand way! Who knew?? Sushi was on point delicious and fresh for our group of 10. Service was spot on. Proximity to the action of Vegas inside & out. Worth a stop in for dinner and a show for sure. Gotta pay to play my friends and this joint is worth your dime. Cheers
1719	Down South Blvd, right off the road is a really cool little place called Vietnam Grille. It is a crowded restaurant which shows how good it is. Yesterday in Charlotte it was windy and damp and cold-how perfect for Pho! We went at lunch time when it was very full but got a seat very quickly and our order was taken in perfect time. We ordered some Crispy Spring Rolls and #26 which is the Beef Pho. Spring Rolls were delicious, all the sauces on the side of table went on to my plate to make a delicious dipping sauce. The Soup arrived --Huge Bowl! Filled with a delicious broth and noodles and beef and then all the extras on the side to add, the bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapenos! It was piping hot and delicious.
1720	our waiter was fine. very polite and attentive. that was the best part of the meal!!!
1721	This is a great place for All-American sub sandwiches. The ingredients always taste fresh, and the bread is always soft. The service is always really friendly and they always make the sandwiches very quickly, which I appreciate. However, I am giving them four stars because on more than one occasion they asked me if I wanted to add cheese to my order and I said yes, they charged me and then I get the sandwich and there is no cheese. Other than that I always have a great experience.
1722	After reading all of the positive reviews on Caffe Boa I am sad to say I didn't have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat and sat. We were never greeted. Not even a water. We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes. Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater.
1723	Schools should not create dress codes. On one hand, yes, uniforms help student focus more on thier work. On another, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school. But kids are allowed ot have thier own creativity.
1724	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is that the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school doesnt want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.
1725	In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms can be seen to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.
1726	the number of reasons on why ff ie are not popular:
1727	one feature that closed the deal is TABS... look what IE implemented in version 7....
1728	I really dont have an exact yes or no answer to this question depending on the situation. If It really got out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know its him then its just a matter of time.
1729	No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.
1730	It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to empathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I could sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.
1731	Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whith her through rough times and I will. Murder is an unforgivable mistake but love is not.
1732	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's going to have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again. Besides, you don't specify who she killed or why. Maybe she had her reasons. Not everyone deserves to live, you know?
1733	I would not turn him in unless he killed more than one because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if I loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
1734	One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, East of Eden, Nabokov's Lolita, 1984, Martian Chronicles - I could go on and on. For real. There's very little that beats the world described in books.
1735	Books r like cool! TV is not! Books are for nerds, TV is for people who like to watch TV but I think Black Ops is better! ROFL!
1736	1. Books don't damage your eyes like TV. does. 2. Books allow your brain to imagine rather than doing it for you. 3. Reading books a lot can help you with spelling. 4. Reading books a lot can help you write better.
1737	because its better for young kids that have to do school work and its healthier for their eyes. When kids need to do their homework they need to do more reading than watching tv.
1738	i think, the india is not ready to lead the world because of many reasons.. 1.) the politians of our country are involved in black money cases. they try to gain or earn money as possible. 2.) they always try to make a big issue of topics that have no meaning. e.g., if a politian says something about another politian, they try to make it a big issue.
1739	no way! screw off! china will dominate, if not, us will. india will never get the chance to rule the world!
1740	Really? This debate is ridiculous. NO they don't. They're practically a 3rd world country.
1741	India does not have the potential to lead the world because the country is full of corruption, corruption in politicians,numerous religion, fight between various religions, and a lot more.
1742	HE HAS A BOSS (RAFFLES) HE HAS TO FOLLOW HIM AND NOT GO ABOUT DOING ANYTHING ELSE IF THEN WHY CANT FARQUHAR HELP SINGAPORE AFTER HE WAS FIRED!!! I SAID HE DOES NOT HAVE THE POSITION TO BE THE FOUNDER!!!!
1743	On 28 January 1819,Raffles came to Singapore. He saw the good location of Singapore and he signed a agreement with the Sultan of Johor on behalf of the British East India Company on February 1819 to use the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post and settlement.
1744	Adrian Peterson? Are you my husband, seriously? If not then I'm sorry. Your name, along with your speech, have me convinced you are. Good one BTW.
1745	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me. its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
1746	Porn is Wrong. mainly because they are Not Doing it Right. it should be HD. in three years, it will be in 3-D.
1747	You are just as much brainwashed as I am, except you're the other way around.
1748	Coming from a casual internet user, I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I'm using firefox though, cause I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
1749	physical education is inefficient and therefore should not be studied in schools
1750	Crimes like robbing and fighting often occurred, so Farquhar set up a small police force.
1751	Farquar dealt with every day problems during the early years of Singapore.He also attempted to know the people and understood malay, whereas Raffles hardly communicated with the natives.
1752	your argument doesn't hold validity since in the cases you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. the state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness. you will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.
1753	What does legalizing drugs have to do with saving lives? Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by eliminating the need for people to illegally abort a child and kill themselves at the same time.
1754	This is this common view of the creationist argument. This is a theological view of the world.. This is all pseudo-science. I understand if you are religious, just dont try to hide it as science. Science never has been about theology. It is about the scientific method. If you really want to debate the science of evolution, you must at least get the scientific method down.
1755	Is porn wrong? Absolutely not!! Everyone has their own definition of morality. If you don't believe in it then don't look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they want to and they probably enjoy it. Whether your the person watching porn or participating in it, porn is a choice not a case of right or wrong.
1756	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that they have importance. Therefore, when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.
1757	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be? Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.
1758	Even though your father might not be the best or always there for you he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with there children and thats what shapes and molds a son or daughters character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are bad they are still our kin.
1759	It's better to have a father than not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is nice or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.
1760	I would rather have a bad father than be fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would rather grow up with a bad father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
1761	Water bottle usage, although maybe a leading corporate industry, is not worth making the environment worse than it already is. These bottles will not start to decompose for another 700 years.
1762	People drink water every day and are oblivious to the fact that they are polluting their own planet
1763	The high price of bottled water is not the water but, in actuality, the cost of the bottling, packaging, shipping, marketing, retailing and transporting it around the world
1764	Water bottles, good or bad? Many people believe plastic water bottles are good. But the truth is water bottles are polluting land and unnecessary. Plastic water bottles should only be used in emergency situations. In an emergency situation like Katrina no one had access to tap water. In an emergency situation like this water bottles are good because it provides the people in need. Other than that water bottles should not be legal because it pollutes the land and big companies get 1000% of the profit.
1765	sheep count him to fall asleep. he won the 1995 world series of poker using uno cards.
1766	Plastic can kill many types of fish species. There have been 26 pieces of fish found in one single fish. Fish are vital to the environment as a food source for birds which eat bugs therfore the cycle of life.
1767	Unless the brain is used no human being can understand any medium. Be it TV or books. By watching the television people can create a make believe situation and think. "What if they would go left? They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?".
1768	I think T.V. is more helpful as the you can watch and listen to something being explained like if we read about budding or spore formation we have to create an image about that in mind, but when we watch the animation of budding then we could understand better. Some people can't even imagine so T.V. is helpful. As concerning the time limit or harm to our eyes, we should watch T.V. in moderation. Surveys have found that a normal person can remember 10% of what he had read and 50% of what he had listened to and watched.
1769	People who are against tv keep on saying that it causes obesity. I'm not going to go for a run and bring a book to read on the way because I think it is much easier to exercise watching tv then reading a book. In gyms people do not have books infront of them, instead they have telvisions because studies have shown that telivision is even more stimulating than books.
1770	Yes I would say it has you relax in case your tired, but you can read to relax as well. Plus have you ever considered about the commercials and how annoying they are?
1771	Marriage evolved because of moral and religious grounds rather than a mere union approved by the state... To debase marriage just to accomodate base desires of gay couples in disguise if a right is simply not true...
1772	I believe that India is fast emerging as a hub for international trade and investment. India has provided a huge opportunity to enhance trade and investments in sectors such as mechanical and electrical engineering, food processing, automotive, tourism and banking among others. Almost every multinational company is focusing on India.
1773	christians are also fun to lawl at because they spend half of their sunday going to church. what a waste!!!!
1774	I find most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. It allows for more logic in my mind.
1775	ever since recorded history people have believed in sky spirits for which no evidence exists at all.
1776	I think you should hit your kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
1777	yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again
1778	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. For example, if the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
1779	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child right and wrong. However, each child responds differently to different punishments. While one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.
1780	I believe spanking is an option to punish a child if nothing else works
1781	I support this because... I got spanked and turned out to be a good daughter because spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
1782	I would also like to point that atheism predates Christianity, destroying your "test of time" argument (which is a rebuttal to begin with- argumentum ad populum). In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.
1783	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
1784	no, spanking is not the solution to your problems... you should talk to the kid with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand they are doing wrong..
1785	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and I am not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.
1786	Well I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me that would be to crazy. Taking another persons life is never the solution or acceptable. Who knows if her next move is not towards me, who knows? If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again.
1787	The murder of a person is a crime that cant be overlooked, to sleep next to a person who has commited this crime, and you knowing about it makes you as much responsible as that persons.
1788	there isnt an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. if the woman was raped, it most certainly is not the baby's fault. the woman with the baby, whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
1789	I HATE P.E. I have to run so much and I hate it soooo much!!!!!
1790	P.E doesn't help fat kids the fat kids just eat too much or they are growing and eventually they will be normal.
1791	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, than law should never change. We should revert back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?
1792	What is wrong with it, if they want to marry let them. If were your child or adopted mother/father you'd accept it!!!
1793	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourselves first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first, success, and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make myself happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.
1794	Our animal insctinc is survival, its what makes us flinch wen we see something coming at ous it makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In todays post modern world, our instinc have change into keep obtaining money to keep ous alive. times change but our desire to survive above other is still thier.
1795	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything I do.
1796	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.
1797	I think personal pursuit because i believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals because how can you help someone if you dont help yourself. Helping yourself first would make you a better person and i think that after you achieve your goals and becoming a better person you would be able to help the common good.
1798	He's a convict, she doesn't have much to worry about legally. There's no chance (almost...) of her being brought to trial on a perjury case, but he might be able to do something in civil court... honestly if she has a new car she should give the car in question back just because it won't be worth the hassle. Remember it's up to the district attorney whether or not to bring criminal charges, and he's not likely to get involved in a family dispute like this... Even in the very obscure possibility that the DA did even consider the case, he won't prosecute for one very good reason. The case would be based on one thing, the word of a convict against the word of your niece, her mother, and her grandmother. DA's don't prosecute cases they know they can't win.
1799	I think if you(we) expect law enforcement to be able to do a certain job, then they should be duly empowered in writing to take the necessary actions, including use of force, to carry out the duties of that job. I also think that citizens should be more involved in community policing. Neighborhood watch is a good program, if there were more people out there doing it, there'd be less demand for police etc.
1800	I don't think there are any victimless crimes, by definition. We might ask why particular laws are enacted, because they seemingly don't hurt an individual, group, or society as a whole. But you have to consider the full effect of the action to determine if there is harm to society. For example, prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate. Similar considerations would apply to other crimes.
1801	Yes it is illegal in the USA, but it can be done. The person I know who's done it has never had a problem with the medications (in this case from India), and never had a problem with Customs or the Postal Inspector, etc. I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious life threatening conditions, because the quality is supposedly questionable. But for other drugs I would do it if I didn't live so close to Mexico (where I can just go over the border and buy cheap prescription meds). If you do a google search on the drug name that you need, you will most likely find an overseas site which offers it for sale. Good luck, but remember it's illegal and potentially dangerous to your health.
1802	Although technically, the previous answers are right (you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and don't pay him! He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a crook you won't be seeing the whole amount of your deposit returned (typically landlords like him make up reasons such as cleaning bills, delapidation etc in order to retain your money) You're moving out at the end of December anyway and he has no power to just 'throw you out', he'd have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal proceedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc) So, I say sod him!! Good luck x
1803	I went to prague, and they are alot less uptight about sex in general, the local bar had strippers etc and you could have an escort turn up at your door within minutes if you wanted to.
1804	To set a uniform standard. Everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by.
1805	Yes,the goverment already grows it and distributes it to terminally ill patients,and they can tax it to bring this country out of the defisant.Besides,how many people u c die from pot related accidents,none their only doing 10 miles an hour u cant kill no one @10 miles an hour.Besides canada has a man named,Mark Emery,named the (Prince of pot)he has brung the country of canada some much in come by selling pot seeds that they have no debt.Plus the U.S.A whouldnt have as many drug related crimes,and if it whould help with sick people to ease the pain then im all for it.with the pain Busch&our Gov.put the american people through we need something to help us cope.
1806	In my personal opinion, guns are bad and should be used only by law enforcement officials and not ordinary citizens. I lost my brother due to an accident involving a gun, and knowing that just anyone nowadays (depending on where you live) can purchase a firearm without even obtaining a license in some cases, makes me cringe with frustration and disbelief! I've just recently seen a report on the TV news that claims that even owning a fake gun such as the now-famous 'paint-ball guns' can lead to serious violence and even death. In some cases, people were accidentally killed or seriously injured while playing among themselves. In other cases, they were mistakenly shot by police who believed they had pointed a real gun at them... Let's leave guns in the hands of those who know how to use them in order to protect law-abiding citizens everywhere!
1807	*shakes head in disbelief* Why do people answer questions when they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about?
1808	I took a look at the statute and it says that the County can seek reimbursement "for any expenses incurred by the county in relation to a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail" as more fully described in the statute. But, the statute is clear that a conviction is required. If the charges were dismissed or you were found not guilty, then the County cannot seek reimbursement. If you were found guilty and sentenced to County jail, then you must pay. If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to "time served", then the County can seek reimbursement. If you sat in jail for 4 months, you were either convicted or you couldn't make bail while you were waiting for trial. If you were convicted, even with a plea bargain, you probably owe the money.
1809	Lawyers are motivated by a combination of money and power. Without legal disputes, such as in civil matters, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for those lawyers.
1810	Civil marriage (i.e. the license you get when you get married) is not religious in any way, shape or form. It is in its very nature controlled by the government and government thus has the right and responsibility to define it. I don't think it should do so in a way that blatantly discriminates against a group like homosexuals, but it is most certainly within the government's prerogative to define marriage. If you find a church that agrees to, you can have a wedding ceremony to whomever or whatever you like, but only the government can decide if it is going to recognize it.
1811	No there are plenty of programs designed for felons to get there life back on tract. You may be able to go back to school depending on your desired field and get the taxpayers to pay for it. You should go to your local DHS or CPS office and they will be able to refer you to where all of that information will be available for you. Good Luck!!!
1812	That video, as well as many others on that subject can be seen at my link. I tend to view these as propaganda. Of course, I view everything that comes out of the White House on this subject as propaganda, too. There are facts that will never be known. There are too many discrepancies on both sides of the argument to make an informed decision one way or the other...
1813	As every one know the terrorists were created by Pakistan, atlease the ones which are active in India. This was done by the government which was in power previously. Now that the present government is trying to build up the gaps between the two nations are trying to come closer to each other, the terrorists are afraid they might loose their job so they are turning against Pakistan now. I think it will take a while to eliminate all the terrorists if the same procedure continue.
1814	No. Cops need the permission of the owner of the house to search it without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger.
1815	The truth is there is no "one man one vote," and there hasn't been since the beginning. It's just more obvious now, that our government is really about "one dollar one vote." Such is the way of a republic. So save up your money and become one of the haves.. that's the only way to win. Our government has no power. It's a facade.
1816	Why did you accept it in his stance? This isn't like a prize or a package from UPS that you can accept on someone's behalf. A supoena is a very important document sent by the courts, with the specific destination being to the person in question, not the person's dog or girlfriend or coworkers. By accepting the paper, you made it easy for ther server to nonchalantly say he "served" the document to the destination person, when in fact it was not. To make an analogy, would you have accepted someone's document if it were a lawsuit? Are you that nosy for someone? The fact is, that person can deny that he was served because you have no real authority to give subpeonas. He can say you burned it and he never got it (no signatures that he himself received anything), and you could be in deep water for that court offense, including possible jail. So, yes he has a decent right to be pissed at you. I would.
1817	Because Jr. doesn’t realize (despite having been told and having pledged twice) that his job is to protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. He thinks his job is to do a variety of other things. If you watch him speak for long enough, he will tell you what he thinks his job is, usually something along the lines of “to lead” or “to tell people what I am thinking” or “to unite Americans behind my common cause” or some other rubbish – never to protect and defend the constitution. So to answer your question, Jr. thinks it is his job to decide if homosexuals can get married, because he truly honestly has no idea what his job really is.
1818	Assuming such value could be reasonably calculated, then I would have no problem with a legislature passing a law like this. It meets the intent of the 5th Amendment Takings Clause, and if the state decides it wants towns to play nice -- that can't be a bad thing.
1819	Its not morally right. I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion but I know that in my heart its wrong and not an option for me. But I would much rather have these women who have their minds set on doing it go to a clean sterile facility and not some rusty shack and put their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts etc. I think every one knows its not morally right they aren't motivated to have an abortion bc its morally right. I think they choose to because of situational factors. N I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their option but they felt that was their only way out.
1820	Your post is a little unclear. In any event, these are really questions you should be asking your lawyer. It's his job to help you understand the consequences of accepting any settlement offer. Write down all your questions, and then meet with your lawyer and ask him. I imagine the settlement involves having all medical bills paid, and that the $20k settlement is for your pain and suffering. Generally the lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 of 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending upon the terms of your engagement with him. So it's most likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will get $20,000, part of which will go to the attorney to pay his fee.
1821	Because it would be thoroughly unfair to force people to pay for things they can't afford.
1822	Sounds like you need a different attorney, and a bail bond agent. First of all this is enough to bring charges against the attorney, the notary, your mother, and YOU. Put all this together and the crime begins with CONSPIRACY! This violates most state notary laws, attorney responsiblity rules, not to mention fraud, forgery, and fraudulent schemes. If you want to correct this situation I would certainly be the first one to speak to the authorities about this. Deeds must be recorded by the state so finding out about this is easy. The "real" inheritor won't have to look too hard to find out what has happened. If I were you I would take cover.
1823	Your "question" is both incoherent and contains mainly opinions stated as fact. Let's start by pointing out that it is standard practice for an attorney to be a notary. Before you call somebody unethical you damn well better have a factual basis for doing so. You have nothing. I notice you make much of your mother having the quitclaim deed singed "for her own personal gain." I take it you regard people who do things for personal gain as scum. Well then kid just what the hell are you doing this for? For YOUR personal gain? Guess what that makes you?
1824	Of course they would if they got in a position where they didn't want a child. But when they do, they tend to say something like "Oh I'm not like the other females, because this or that happen, so this is why I'm having an abortion". It's usually okay for them, but they're anti-abortion when it's someone else.
1825	What they are talking about doing is not right. There are current laws on our books that would allow our govt to fine that illegal alien $250,000, plus incarceration, then deportation. Also, there are laws on our books that prohibit employers from hiring undocumented workers. They all need to follow the current laws. You are right. If you or I were to disobey the laws like these people are (employers as well as illegal aliens), we would be locked up for years. It's just not right.
1826	That WOULD DEPEND UPON WHETHER THE PERSON WAS SENT TO A PROFESSIONAL IN THE FIELD IN WHICH THE PERSON WAS BEING EVALUATED. IN SOME CASES THE JUDGE CAN SEND A PERSON FOR RE-EVALUATION IF HE/SHE DETERMINES THE PERSON WHO GAVE THE EVALUATION TO BE BIASED TOWARD THE PERSON BEING EVALUATED. BUT, NO, A PERSON CANNOT BE RE-EVALUATED MERELY TO SATISFY THE WHIMS OF A JUDGE. OR ANY ONE ELSE.
1827	Since this is a family member, you have to work things out. Confront them privately and tell them to stop. Threaten to tell the whole family if they do not repay what they took-not just from you but your entire family. Do not fall for sob stories. The time for sob stories was before she took the money. What did she need the money for? Gambling, drugs, etc? Then demand that she get counseling. If it was for a valid reason, then you need to be firm but fair. This is not how people behave; especially towards family. Avoid getting the police involved if possible. This will only lead to being on Dr. Phil. Change the locks and explain she is no longer welcome in your house.
1828	Marijuana smoking should be legalised everywhere. It is a simple natural herb, which provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many medicinal properties. It relieves stress, reduces pain, and certain studies show that it can disipate asthma, and be beneficial to alzheimer's patients. The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which introduced the name marijuana, so that nobody would realise that they were restricting the use of hemp.
1829	I don't think separation of church and state said anything about being tax free. If a minister teaches bible, that's one thing, but pastor's like Rod Parsley, who for years has flaunted his political view's, and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should lose his tax exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he's a millionaire many times over.
1830	The federal government has no delegated power to make laws concerning clothing except in those geographical areas under direct federal control. States and localities have power to make such laws within their jurisdictions. By and large such laws reflect local perceptions of decency and civility. During the last 30 or so years the existence of such laws and the application of such laws have significantly loosened. For example, most people no longer formally dress to go to church or to dine out. For those who do dress differently they should be realistic in their degree of difference by not anticipating a warm acceptance of some style and this is particularly true when dress reflects sexual mores.
1831	I don't know. As an American I find it so hilarious that the UK keeps pissing away so much money into that royal family thing. Granted, I wouldn't be so amused if I were English, but since I'm not- HAHAHAHAHA- And let them keep talking about Bush all they want. At least we elected him. What do they call it over there? Divine Right? HAHA- glad my tax dollars don't go to ski trips, drinking binges, designer clothes, torrid love affairs, expensive cars and castles and God only knows what else...
1832	The problem is -- until these people have actually been charged with and convicted of some crime, she can't just remove them, absent a supermajority vote of the House.
1833	It is only to assuage our own guilt that we are given a last meal. In reality we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. think about this, how is killing different for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising their usage more?--"You kill someone in the state of Texas, We'll kill you back" Ron White-- --Food for Thought--
1834	It seems that the fruits of theology are rotten and few; the few theological thinkers that are notable have only produced works of worth under the umbrella of philosophical thought. Theologians are often poor philosophers, like Aquinas. Theology is third rate philosophy, as it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims. It is *objectively* less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy because of this presupposition (according to the principle of parsimony). Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics and related subjects form the grounds on which religions may be legitimately and fruitfully discussed.
1835	I just don't think its worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when it will end. I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and of course it could be a terrible and rough life, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world. In the end, we are nothing but souls connected to a life support system (the body). If my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulus to my brain rather than "real" experiences, so be it.
1836	I am a heterosexual male, and I can find no reason for condemning it as immoral. Though I do believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the bible is true and thus biblical scripture does not convince me. Additionally, if something is wrong their should be observable reasons in reality, so the justification for homosexual acts being wrong should deal strictly with observable reality.
1837	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall of beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be thay much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.
1838	I believe businesses shouldn't (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces.
1839	A long while ago Putin ordered all his government officials to close offshore accounts. He ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars. And wealthy Russians use other countries to skate around Russian taxes. Now the US and EU are sanctioning business and people (I try to keep up on all the sanctions but I lose track). Europe buys from Russia much needed gas, and in turn, Russia buys things from Europe. They have a nice little ecosystem. So I believe, not only will this hurt Europe more so in the long run, but help Russia. Because Putin may use this to reign in his corrupt officials and tax skating billionaires. Don't rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens, because they will get sanctioned or frozen. This is just my opinion, or view. I'd like to hear others. Thanks.
1840	I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they'd go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I'm not in any way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is extremism. I believe we as a culture, nation, even the world, should study more on extremism. It pushes people to do the craziest shit and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they're right and we as a society are wrong. If we study the extremes, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things.
1841	My dad is 28 years older than my mom, who he met when she was 17. I have a half-brother older than my mom as well. A friend from my high school and I got into a argument when a 34 year old teacher from our high school was sexting a student (she was sexting back). I failed to see the big deal seeing as there were bigger problems in the world and I grew up with a belief that age did not matter when intimacy was involved. Not only was she pissed off when I expressed this belief but all the other girls in the group text. Why am I wrong?
1842	I've read the "Limits to Growth" study written in 1972, and subsequent books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and others, who were talking about the problems and limits to capitalism and consumer society.
1843	First off, I understand that sour cream is already available in a squeezable container. My view is that this should be the *standard* type of container. It is usually sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to yogurt. Most of the time sour cream is used, it would be more useful in a squeeze type of container, similar to ketchup or mustard. Yes, *sometimes* it may be more convenient to have a yogurt type of container, making it easy to scoop with a spoon. But a large majority of the time, it is used as a topping, which would be much easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm. CMV.
1844	I believe that the current driving age, 16, is too low and that teenagers at that age are a danger on the road. They are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that they are unable to consistently operate a car safely. I think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use. Car accidents happen all too often and keeping kids off the road will make things safer for them and for the adults that need to use cars.
1845	Title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, people with God kill people" has led me to write this CMV. I am not a religious man, so I don't feel this is a biased CMV. I feel saying "Gun's don't kill people, People with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people". I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect. It harbours hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own. Change my view.
1846	I'm not sure why, but I completely feel that if you made plenty of money doing the worst job on earth, you should be content. For example, if I made 100k a year from a job that I am not necessarily content with, I would prefer that over a job where I made 60-70k a year and enjoyed the 8 hour day. I feel this way because in my opinion, if you made good money with a job that (for you) has low job satisfaction, the time you have off will be even better because you have the money to be able to afford and do whatever you wanted, versus being happier with your job but not having the things you want in life. I feel I'm at a serious turning point in my life, and I want to make sure I look at all angles of opportunities presented to me. Please CMV!
1847	Lately I have been wondering about this. Over in /r/ledzeppelin there's been several recent interviews from Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to disparage mp3's. But I'm willing to bet if you sat him down with proper experimental controls, he'd fail as much as anyone else at hearing any difference, at say 256 kbps bitrate or higher. He's mentioned the new Led Zeppelin deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks. That being said, I still don't like mp3's, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob about it, probably much like a lot of people. I like my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold cd's (Mobil Fidelity Sound Lab etc.) or LP's. But my ears probably can't catch much difference. And certainly I hugely love plugging an iPod full of mp3's into my fancy vehicle audio system.
1848	I believe politicians don't have the knowledge and know-how on how to run a country. We seen multiple cases of corruption, bankrupcy all over the world, and countries failing to maintain a positive economy. Most of the solutions come from an assembly where politicians reunite and discuss those solutions. Most of the time they fail to implement a good one. In the early 1900s there was a movement called Technocracy movement which wanted to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they running (e.g education would be run by someone connected to it that has spent a majority of her life studying education) I believe our politic system isn't been run like it should. CMV P.S: English isn't my mother language, I hope I made myself clear
1849	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point of despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health were a bigger issue and looked at more closely then the shooting potentially would not have happened. I'm all for feminism, do recognize that women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. CMV.
1850	Hi everyone, After watching the news recently, it really seems that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some member states (UK mainly) are really watching the elections sort of had me thinking if Europe could ever be a unified body. Dissolving the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war. I really hope I am not being too doom and gloom with this post, but I would really like to hear more about this subject. Please pardon my ignorance if this comes off as so, but I would really like to learn a bit more about what might happen and maybe CMV.
1851	Why did the "true" gods of today's religions not see fit to make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? Wouldn't the Christian God, being jealous, have made himself known earlier than he did? If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wander around so long worshiping "false gods". Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped, aren't sitting "up there" seriously ticked off? Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Pissed, that after explicitly putting their word forth, we strayed and worshiped false idols?
1852	the cause to all problems is miscomunication because... car acccidents cause by drivers unawere of what other drivers are doing things turning into gossip because somebody did not take the time to say the full story fights caused by 2 people who did not comumacate the rules about a game proply terrorists blowing people up because the goverment would not listen to there concerns in the first place there are lots more need i go on.
1853	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them be content where they are. Welfare means taxing people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth. Welfare means being forced to pay for your neighbor's new television. Welfare means having to pay for some fat ass that didn't know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day. Welfare is wrong!
1854	The drinking age should be 16. There is very strong anecdotal evidence from societies where casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age. In these countries, such as France, there is a significantly lower rate of drinking-related diseases and deaths. If casual drinking is integrated into a society, it can seriously curb binge drinking when one reaches 18, 19 or 21. Furthermore, these extra years of alcohol sales can increase tax revenue and fund programs that help those afflicted with alcoholism to recover.
1855	Caught this forum early, whoot - another colour forum. Well done to the person that made it! RED. I'm guessing you said excite. I never really used to like this colour, since when I was little it reminded me of blood/murder. But as I got older, I started to appreciate this colour more.
1856	This argument is very close to me at the moment, an ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old has had unprotected sex with a minor of whom is not even totally "developed" yet. He sees no wrong in what he is doing even though he is: a. Breaking the law. b. Aware he is breaking the law. c. Proud of it. Personally, I think that it is not all that hard to wait until you are 16, after all, if teens are sexually active at such a young age, it could cause such problems as teenage pregnancy, STD's and even permanent damage to their bodies. I personally see it as a foul thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreperable mental and physical damage and is simpy morally wrong. I'm not one that support no sex before marriage, but sex before you even really know what it is, is a different story.
1857	Man always has the freedom to do what he wants to do, but not what he should do. Adam had the choice of doing either good or evil. He chose evil. That choice damaged his relationship with God and resulted in an evil world. Now man still has the freedom to do what he wants to do. The problem is that man only wants to rebel and do evil. Look around for proof. But God has a remedy for the evil. It is Jesus Christ. Repent and trust in Him.
1858	Humans are known as homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. Therefore humans are animals. And how can a human be "above" an animal? What qualifies as above? Should there be some sort of intelligence limit that divides humans from being classified as animals? How does greater intelligence lift humans out of the animal category? Would an extremely bright dolphin no longer count as an animal? I must admit that humans are very different from the rest of the animal world, but I don't see how this elevates us in any way.
1859	This piece is a call to action in the UK to put a stop to the governments big brother program. Londons Westimister Council are further compounding the problem that people don't trust the government and their surveillance of British people by taking away something that most people love and want to keep. Additionally, Banksy has made what was once a boring ugly wall something interesting, engaging and poignant. He is a celebrated artist in his own right and Westiminster Council should recognise this piece as a gift to be embraced rather than erased.
1860	In status quo children are now expriencing the wrong meaning of christmas because a recent survey shows that majority of children see christmas as gift day or the day where you get anything you want from your parents,which should clearly not be the case in status quo the meaning for christmas is suppose to be the birth of Jesus Christ and when Santa Clause is moved into the picture children and even now adults see Santa Clause as the Christmas symbol and it is no longer seen as Jesus. this is like a persons birthday party,everyone gives attention to a different person instead of the birthday boy/girl so it is clearly not right,that is the same thing that is happening in Status Quo.
1861	I agree that legalizing performing enhancing drugs is an absurd thought. One of the reasons performance enhancing drugs are illegal is that they do harm the body. it is in the best interest of the government to protect the players health because they are too young to see the consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models for too many young kids. Do you want kids walking around pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending they haveboobs? This will encourage the use of steroids for younger kids becuase their favorite athlete is on them. not only will you see a rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs in proffesional players, but in nonproffesional players as well. If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, it would cause all athletes to start using regardless if they want to or not because they will feel that they need to take them just to be able to compete with the other athletes.
1862	An economic superpower in Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new shock wave military tactics, and far more powerful than Japan. Japan was fighting in Jungles in smaller bands, and their navy was stopped pretty quickly. Only their loyalty to emperor stopped the entire country surrendering a couple of years earlier. Germany on the other hand were one of the world big boys, new military tactics and equipment, new scientific advancements, a global economic power (before the war). No contest. Nazi Germany wins.,
1863	Well, it is a very touchy issue. Much more touchy than most non-Canadians might think... Yet, the French nationalists are not objecting to his performance based on artistic merit - where they would have a very good point - but on the basis of his nationality....when all he is really trying to do is just celebrate the history of an important place... Frankly, I think the best way to celebrate Quebec City's 'birthday' would be to build a humongous statue to the father of Canada, General Wolfe, on the plains of Abraham!
1864	This is a difficult choice, as these are both of my if not my two favorite bands. I think Queen wins, though, because their anthems (We will Rock You, We are the Champions...) will live on long after the band is forgotten. Also the range of themes and ideas their music explores is a lot wider. Pearl Jam is good, musically, but Queen is better.
1865	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would check "education," so their money can go towards their children. Education directly affects the family. Now, say they never got sick. Then they would uncheck health care. This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized.
1866	Ocarina of time is more fun than Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT, but OoT just stands out on top of MM. We're talking about what most people regard as the best game ever made. OoT successfully brought the Zelda series into the 3D realm, and gave us a massive world to explore and one of the most engrossing stories ever to be found in a video game. OoT was one of my first game addictions, and the game that got me into the Zelda series.
1867	I'll start. Obviously I can't know if I would actually go through with it should I find myself in this position, but I'm at least willing to entertain the possibility. If I were suffering early onset Alzheimer's or similar mental decline I would consider ending my life. The ability to maintain a continuous consciousness is what makes me who I am. At the point where I lose my grip on reality, forget who I am, forget what I am, forget what I believe, then I cease being me.
1868	The average salary of an american is 32,000$ the average salary of a teacher (not including the monetary value of benefits) is 53,000$ In wisconsin, the salary including benefits is 75,000$ 4.5 billion is spent on teacher salaries, and 1.6 billion is spent on their amount of benefits. I believe that this is a huge amount of money for someone to receive, especially since all mediocre teachers are practically impossible to fire. Teachers should be paid and given raises based on performance, not the amount of years they stayed at the school. I recommend watching the documentary 'waiting for superman', because it sheds light on the many imperfection of our failing public school system. The US should have close to the highest test scores, but because of our abundance of average teachers that cant be fired, we are not. Instead, the US has some of the lowest scores.
1869	Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct? Just because one man has a feeling all matter warps space-time doesn't make it true! Think about it... get ready... this is the theory... all matter sucks.
1870	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the world. We have a total of 366 military ships in commision as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
1871	There is no disagree side but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests; they are one and the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve us in the situation. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.
1872	My husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi of our lives. And he would follow that up with also saying "and I've had a shit load of sushi" Seriously - don't go to one of the many overpriced places in Vegas or one with all the deep fried cream cheese roll crap. Drive to Boulder City and eat here.
1873	I own a business off of Craig street and l am sometimes forced to eat the food on this strip. Yesterday was the day. The people are so rude, they hardly made eye contact. The actual food l received wasn't fit to feed my dog. Seriously, skip this place. Forget what l said, don't skip, run for your life.
1874	I had a really great dining experience here. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and left the cheese off so it was vegan. SO. GOOD. The fresh basil was the highlight, pasta was perfect, and that alone makes it 5 stars. However... The best part of dinner aside from the food was our server, Alyssa. She was attentive, familiar with what was vegan on the menu (which I didn't know), and always making sure our drinks were filled. Definitely ask for her when you come! I will when I go back for sure. It's always a good dining experience when the staff is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious. This was an A+ experience. Very happy.
1875	Slow service, too expensive, weird chairs with wheels on. I ordered a selection of Sashimi which tasted OK but not worthy of the price tab. Also had a beef noodle dish which was mediocre at best. Wine is $13 a glass! 6 of us ate there, nothing extravagant 2 wines, 2 beers $174 before tip. Yikes. Don't bother.
1876	I don't go to jack in the box often. However I've never really had a bad experience with one. The service here sucks. I've come here twice with this last instance being the last time I bother. I've walked in both times. It took about 15 minutes to get a single jumbo jack last time. It wasn't busy. Today it took 3 minutes with me being the only person in line and two people looking right at me and not taking my order before I left. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. 5 guys will continue to get my business over you. They seem to take less time than you do and they're a walk in burger place.
1877	atmosphere here was nice and a good date spot the menu was a little confusing because it was in Italian I think but the waiter was happy to help I got the seafood linguine as recommended by the waiter as a popular dish the food took quite a while to arrive but we did get free bread with olive oil but it was quite hard and dry so I did not really like it and didn't eat it when we got the food we were quite disappointed by the portion as it was expensive for the small portion we got. we easily demolished the noodles in 5 min and felt hungry even after spending around $25. the noodles themselves were very tasty and flavourful and they add cheese at the top but definitely not worth the price so only come if you're willing to splurge or have a small stomach overall I would not come again due to the high price tag and the small portions
1878	This buffet was by far the worst buffet I've ever been to. The food was very bland, selection was small, salads were wilted, no sign of vegetables anywhere, gravy was congealed and the "roast beef" was the size of my fist and then they slice off 2 paper thin slices for you. Also was extremely overpriced at $19 on a Tuesday night. Better off going to Mandarin.
1879	I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they would be concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible, so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is expensive, it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1880	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to wear their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.
1881	When they are young and trying to find them selves there is no need to get rid of there independence.
1882	I think that school uniform is a bad idea because its too much work to clean the uniform and its a pain if you have to put on a lot of stuff in the morning
1883	Firefox of course. And I like this website but I don't find it very clear. This one is better : theworlddebating.com
1884	I can reconfigure Firefox very easily to meet my needs as my life changes. If I need SEO extensions I can get them. If I need an HTML color picker instead when I get more involved with other elements of site development, FF is easily remodeled to suit my new browsing needs. The breadth and variety of Firefox add-ons is a critical advantage.
1885	Firefox has the user made extensions which cater for the user based community therefore it is considered more popular.
1886	No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like, you told me I had a part in it, and we are just going our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.
1887	No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...
1888	If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feelings are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
1889	If it was the person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.
1890	books are always better than tv because books give more knowledge than tv does.
1891	Well, Books is better than T.V. because T.V. makes your eyes bad and kills imagination! Read 'Television' by Roald Dhal you'll know it all!!! :) :) :) :)
1892	i think with this growing condition India cannot replace other developed countries like USA LONDON AND other countries. Because most of the people are illitrate here so i think india cant.
1893	I think in any case its better to have no father then to have a bad father. Either way you still lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a bad father then whats the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a bad father figure.
1894	In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a bad father. I wouldnt know how it feels to have a bad father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish there dad wasn't around. Now if my dad was like that I would think the same because at least by not having a father you wouldnt know how it feels to be dissapointed by a father.
1895	Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was formed by Raffles to oversee the project.
1896	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. In fact, I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart
1897	For us to understand God, is like your cat or dog trying to understand your income tax return! Evolution and creation go hand in hand!
1898	Was there a historical record of human evolution? dang, I must have missed it
1899	Our world could be a giant hologram http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html It is exceedingly likely that we live in a simulated universe
1900	I used to be a firefox user but I only have 2GBs of RAM on my system and I like to use more than one program at a time. Firefox uses way too much memory to justify the one or two advantages.
1901	Physical education, if taught and encouraged properly and approached with the right attitude, can be rewarding for both student and teacher.
1902	How are we supposed to combat childhood obesity if we don't start at a young age?
1903	I think it is a good idea to make physical education be mandatory in school because it will be healthy for the student to become a healthy person and they will not have the risk of obesity.
1904	Farquhar won the affection and respect from the people with his doings. When he was sacked, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left Singapore. This shows that he is very important to the people.
1905	William Farquhar stayed in Singapore longer than Raffles, so he had more time to get to know the people better, to earn the trust of the people, to find out the problems that the people were facing and to solve those problems
1906	So then you're saying that if the woman were to get an abortion right after then t would be fine?
1907	Now, in my beloved language, I'll tell you Eso a lo que llaman un "bebé, un ser humano" no es más que una planta, menos, me atrevera a decir Lo nico que hace es chupar recursos, al igual que la planta, aunque las plantas nos dan oxgeno... Nadie niega que sea una vida, pero no puede sentir ni pensar, que es lo que suelen decir que hace mas a los humanos que a los animales El aborto es matar a un parásito
1908	It's not a question of what YOU choose, it's a question of "who decides"? A woman is not your property. Nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to command her obedience.
1909	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro life. If I choose pro-life I have no choice.
1910	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe.
1911	It is no more wrong than any other form of expression that is used for commercial gain.
1912	porn is not wrong unless its sick porn eg child,animal or rape but the other pornography is ok aslong as its viewed in a discreet manner.
1913	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however, it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.
1914	I personally think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advancement of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.
1915	Who in their right mind wants to get rid of Catholic school girl outfits?
1916	School uniform is a great idea, just because it makes impossible to hold the race for the fashion among pupils. let it be, one pupil is richer than another. rich can begin to show off in front of those who are poorer. this action will create a negative atmosphere in the school and can start row between both pupils. As a rule, As a rule, it often occurs between the girls, although it is not rare between the boys. that's why school uniform liquidates all conflicts.
1917	I think school uniform is a good idea. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore plain clothes every day, they would be concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. This is sensible, so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is expensive, it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1918	yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. each school's uniform signifies its goal for instance i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof.
1919	A bad father would be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he will be able to teach you what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all, I think. He could toughen you up. Also you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or not, you already know.
1920	Bottled water produces up to 1.5 million tons of plastic waste per year. Additionally, plastic requires up to 47 million gallons of oil per year to produce. Moreover, over 80 percent of plastic bottles are simply thrown away.
1921	I like television tv is cool and tv is great tv is like the baby in my womb it is like the sun in the morning it is like the cool brisk air on your first day of school it is like the day you get diagnosed with cancer it is like the day you find out that you are lesbian it is like the day that you realize you just wasted your time reading this
1922	Plastic is good light weight and a good material for ditrabutions.
1923	Basing the bible it's definitely wrong and realistically marriage is intended for man and a woman it's one way of saying to reproduce.
1924	for the record - i am not gay. i'm married and have a daughter.
1925	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together. However, this idea was corrupted by the morals and society of our time.
1926	An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
1927	india is bound by water on 3 sides, some thing which most other nations do not have. this is a big advantage for india
1928	India moving a step ahead in becoming a world power everyday.... concerns shown by other countries says it all..... Yes we have some internal problems which country don't have... but time is river water and it brings changes... we growing as one of the leading power... I'll not compare my country with others as Napoleon said"Comparing yourself with others is same as insulting yourself" We have the 3rd largest army in the world... we produce most no. of doctors and engineers every year (count in your own country) but still we don't like to prise ourselves because we don't believe anyone is stronger or weaker than us....!!!!! NAMASTE!!!!
1929	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
1930	No one ever said science is PERFECT. That's the difference between religion and science, Science admits it doesn't have all the answers while Religion is dogmatic enough to not even recognise FACTS. And even just what TRUTH really stands for.
1931	The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser. What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies or hallucinations. For example, there is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.
1932	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. Therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.
1933	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.
1934	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1935	One of the key components to Christianity is FAITH. Just because you can't see it, feel it, or hear it, but you know it's there.
1936	I'm a Christian, so I am on this side.
1937	I assume everyone on this side of this argument was raised in a Christian home, grow up a pair and ask yourself, why do I worship a scruffy sandal wearing cultist.
1938	why are we fighting, right now those scientologists are on the loose and we need to come together to fight them
1939	I don't think that spanking should be necessary,spanking would last just a minute, but punishing could last up to 2 or 3 weeks or maybe more.
1940	No because if we hit our children they are gonna think that we do not love them.
1941	No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.
1942	Not everything begins with violence, parents shouldn't hit kids for discipline, only if its necessary.
1943	I disagree on the parents use spanking as an option to dicipline because the childrens are not going to be scare of what their parents are going to show them and also because if you do that to your childrens are learning what their parents show them and also because that is not going to help that much the childrens
1944	I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others I would not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I would not turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like that, then no I would not turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
1945	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out their brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.
1946	Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. So yea, i would turn them in.
1947	we did not create the baby, we are not the ones who gave it life, why should we be the ones who put it to death, we have no authority to do such a thing.
1948	I choose life Reagan once said something like this Notice that everyone who is pro abortion has been born
1949	AS LONG AS IT IS NOT DISEASE WE SHOULD ALL BE FINE WITH IT ITS NOT OUR BUSINESS!!!
1950	Dosen't it say in the declaration of independence that we have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
1951	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.
1952	it is better to help yourself before you can help others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.
1953	Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who pursue personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to pursue personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.
1954	Yes its illegal. The consequences are going to be.... you and your friend going to each house and cleaning it up. Just like when people toilet paper. A few years ago when i was a minor my brother and i went around drawing on people garage doors in chalk...long story short we got caught and had to go around and clean every single garage. Have fun :) ps...i keep reading some of these answers (HAHA)...your not going to go juvenile jail and your not going to be charged as long as its not bad words. Go be a teenager.
1955	You know, one of the first things the Nazis did in coming to power was to ban the private possession of firearms. There's a reason; when they wanted to knock the door down and carry people away without due process of law, they didn't want anyone to be able to fight back. It is also true that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Now, some would say no, outlaws and police. I argue that at that point, those two groups become indistinguishable. Do you honestly believe that every cop in your town is honorable and trustworthy?
1956	What a great question! In our real world, it is much more likely for a poor person to be convicted of a felony than a rich person. So effectively, when EX-felons are denied the franchise, poor communities are denied equal representation. Read some law articles on the difference between de facto and de jure; I'm sure you'll find the subject interesting and enlightening.
1957	No, you still have to pay your rent,but here is a few things you can do: If the landlord does not make the repair the tenant can do any of the following: Take the rent when it is due to the local clerk of courts. A tenant must be current in their rent with the clerk of courts (called rent deposit). Apply to the court to order the landlord to make the repairs. The court can also lower the rent until the repairs are made or give the tenant some of the rent money so the tenant can have the repairs made. End the lease. Cancel the rental agreement and move. This can be done only after the tenant has given appropriate notice, and the landlord has failed to correct the condition.
1958	Although adultery may actually be against the law where you live, and although you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is mislaced anger. This woman was not coming to your home. She was invited to your home by your husband. She was not making out with him. Your husband was making out with her. And she did not get pregnant. Your husband got her pregnant. This woman did nothing to you. Your husband did. Make sure to divorce him. Get a good settlement, maintenance and child support. The best revenge is a life well lived.
1959	Depends on what the contract says, I suppose. It may call for mutual satisfaction or give you a right to ask for them to be redone. Most likely you have to pay anyway. However, the issue may not be best approached by means of your "legal recourse." If you haven't done so, tell the designer how unhappy you are and why, and ask that the designs be redone. It may be that the designer will work with you to redo the work -- it would be in the designers' long-run best interests to see that his/her customers are happy with the design.
1960	What an obtuse question! Simply because that word was used by certain people precisely as> a term of offense to describe'some other people'. Your question would have more validity if it had been "why did white people decide to use that word as a term of offense in the first place?" Yes we know that black people use the word within their own community, just as gay people use the word 'queer'. But that doesn't change the fact that the word was first given currency as a deliberate insult.
1961	It is a number of people living in a small area of Manhattan. Most other cities that are more spread out will clean the streets less frequently. In Phoenix, Arizona, they pick up garbage once a week and sweep only once a week. We are more spread out than Manhattan. If NYC did not clean as often as it does, there would be a lot of garbage all over the street.
1962	Ok, hun, he's an adult and I take it that you are a minor? First thing, he should have never put you in a criminal situation to begin with. Obviously he didn't care enough about you to keep you out of possibly going to jail, so I would just let him sit in there and think about what he has done. If he is a man at all, he should be the one apoligizing to you.
1963	No,I don't think so,not in a civilised society. I guess you're asking this in relation to the impending trial verdict on Saddam Hussein.If he is sentenced to death,there will be just further violence,hatred and bloodshed.For serious crimes,I think a life sentence in prison is the appropriate punishment...I can't see how killing someone solves anything.
1964	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain is not complete at the age of 18, which poses a risk of more serious damage being caused from alcohol in an 18-year-old. Whether true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit. Personally, I believe that if you are old enough to die for your country you should be old enough to have a drink.
1965	Yes. And they need to be pared down now. The Child Protective Services in my state make an awful mess of families with no real proof of any reason. They do the children more harm than good by ripping them from famlilies with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families and basically terrorizing everyone. Babies included. I have seen many families destroyed. My son's is one of them. And there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play thier God games and bowing low each time. Even saying "DHS" in relation to this situation lost one set of grandparents visitiation rights with the kids. This is way, way beyond the scope of their original job.
1966	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to go to court about. Regardless of individual court cases, the trick is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape in which the so called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I do not know of any specific court cases.
1967	Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. What about the baby's choice? No baby would decide...I"I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I COULD live outside my mothers body) be stabbed in the skull and have my brain sucked out. How selfish are the women who think it is all about them and what they need or want? People that support this should be forced to watch one being performed...IN PERFORMANCE!
1968	Is it possible, yes. Your question is difficult to answer because it really depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge. Many federal courts require individuals with cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service. If a judge has a standing policy against such things in his courtroom, whether on or off, you could be held in contempt. My guess is that most judges wouldn't go as far as to hold someone in contempt if it was off. But I've personally seen a person's phone get confiscated b/c there was a concern that the individual was attempting to take pictures of witnesses with it in a drug case (i.e.--witness intimidation).
1969	The whole thing sounds pretty dodgy to me. An extension without the proper footings is not legal and if it has been built without planning permission that too is not legal. The letter that you write should not be to help them make a sale on a property that has parts that could fall down in a gale and perhaps cause injury. It should be to state that it had only been built for the time that it has and that the building should be inspected as there are no proper foundations. If you knowingly write an incorrect statement and the truth comes out then you could be caught for aiding and abetting an illegal sale. The whole thing is a mine field so either stay out of it altogether or put the local authority in the picture.
1970	It seems that what bothers you most is the inconsistency of laws. We have laws that are supposedly in place (like the seatbelt law) to protect us from harming ourselves -- yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm. What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives." I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers for picking up the cost of a person's health care if they've chosen self harming behavior. (Examples: seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.) If we were just honest, and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
1971	You can't export Democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government. Muslim countries do not have the Enlightenment background we had in the nascent United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic. Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran. Despite the attempts by some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience. Islam needs to go through their own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed. Until then we can only keep (weak) control by military force which sets up blowback as we now see in the Middle East.
1972	My wife was severely abused as a child (no details) We are happy in our marriage and she is an excellent wife and partner. So the answer is yes but it requires patience and understanding. As far as your plight I will wish you the best on finding true love, it is possible and it is possible over 50. But if there is no trust in that one you are crazy about then move on. Lies have no place in a relationship.
1973	Your best bet would be to get legal counsel to accompany you to court and explain your rights to you. Not knowing why you and your daughters father are not together my advice can only be very generalized. If he refuses to pass a drug screening, then most likely his custody will not go through. When this case presents before a judge and you mention drug activity, the judge may order a drug test. If he fails to comply with the court order there is no way he will get custody. Although I am not personally in the legal field, I have had to deal with custody battles many times in my line of work and it is never a happy trail. I wish you all the luck.
1974	Please note, there are quite a number of illegal immigrants in our prisons and jails, for rape, murder, drug smuggling and theft. Because they crossed the border illegally, it means that criminals also crossed the border. Without a system, anybody can come in, no matter how diseased or criminal. And, interestingly enough, not all law-breaking illegal immigrants are honest and hard-working people.
1975	It's a little pointless and egotistical to do so. The idea of this site is that we collect information from various viewpoints, and then allow others to judge the value of the content. Voting for your own answer defeats the purpose, so certainly is unethical. It's most likely against Yahoo!'s rules too. I can't imagine how anyone can feel they've 'won' by voting on their own answers. It seems SO childish. There are no prizes and no bragging rights here - we're all just trying to share our experience and information.
1976	The Supreme Court has ruled on this already and as long as the first Amendment is not altered, abortion should be legal. The S.Court ruled abortion should be legal based on a person's 1st Amd right to privacy over what happens to their body. It has nothing to do with when life begins,etc... as some would like it to. It is all about this country's freedoms and constitution giving us protections over our personal self.
1977	in response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless peoples' health and lives. it would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. besides, cigarette industry deserves to crash. i would love to see that day. all those who sell death deserve to be jobless. not teachers and medics and firefighters. those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
1978	I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the intergration of the whole of America, not just in education system, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but seperate". However when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an arguement that the system is now not seperate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice.
1979	Tell them exactly what you posted here. They should excuse or re-schedule you. I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice because of that (since I was not living in town at the time). If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it.
1980	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it.
1981	I think the main problem with the trust issue is mainly due to the criminal justice system. In order for law to work it must be swift, severe, and gauranteed: People sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no punishment, and you can commit the same crime in 2 places, one gets you probation and the other gets you 20 years. I believe that until these issues are better delt with, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone. Unfortunately our justice system is unique in the world, it is a system that would literally let 10 guilty people go than send one innocent person to jail, which I can't argue with, but hopefully in the future people will realize that it's a mess and someone will fix it.
1982	STOP! before retaining an attorney $$$, consider contacting the business and informing them of the incident and request the name of their insurance provider. Often they make reasonable offers. (in this case doc bill plus $1000) Only if they refuse and your injuries/damages exceed your states max. small claims award by $1000 should you even consider discussing the matter with an attorney. Unless you were injured and treated professionally (have a bill) your case is weak. Damages for pain and suffering with this type of occurance will be aprox. $1000 unless you can prove the incident was the result of negligence or malice. If you hire an attorney it is likely there won't be enough money left to pay the bill for your care.
1983	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Even those that are here illegaly. Although there seems to be more public sentiment against illegals here of late. I would blame that on the media or the politicians making an issue of it more than anything else. ive lived in Texas all my life the illegal alien thing is nothing new.there were plenty illegals here for more more than thirty years and never heard one complaint until the last few weeks when the media started blasting it out the airways. Unfortunately Ive noticed that the media seems to have a large affect on the popular opinion here. Why they have chosen this time to make it a major issue is beyond anything i can understand.
1984	Legally yes it can and has happened. The urban legend of Biker chicks knocking a guy down and having thier way with him in a park is an example. The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy by definition. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they have little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. A guy weak enough to be "raped" would be a laughing stock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.
1985	I heard about this on the news this morning. IMO, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is. On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father. But this is just my opinion.
1986	Thong-Wearing Men Arrested at Wal-Mart Thu Jul 29,10:59 AM ET AP SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. - Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "triple-dog dare," authorities said. The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct. When asked why they were wearing thong underwear, one of the men said a friend "triple-dog dared" them.
1987	If you feel that its necassary yes...but are you still going to be able to work and bring in your own income? These semi truck drivers carry insurance and yes some of them carry million dollar insurance but not all of them go after the company he is driving for. He probably feels guilty about it every day of his life. I am very sorry for your pain. Good Luck to you
1988	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts. The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues. Guantanamo was an excellent example. While the inmates were humiliated, they weren't tortured. The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the US. Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture. So, if you feed them, it's torture. If you don't and they starve, it's torture. Finally, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.
1989	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from the tax challenges faced in mature economies. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting as well now.
1990	The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not. To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient. So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted. This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.
1991	I believe that if a person can commit suicide, they can continue living. It's stupid to do such a thing when you are willful enough to consider or even act on upon it. It really doesnt make any sense why you rather take your own life then live when you are so capable of the former. Suicide is not an option i find necessary and that a person who commit is stupid. So, topic is "if you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to live on". Change my view over this topic as I am open to all responses from you all.
1992	Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my high school only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level.
1993	I feel that concepts of right and evil are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years, and because of this there are no objective morals and true 'good' and 'evil' don't exist. Not that I advocate rampant immorality or anything, that'd be stupid. Most acts we generally consider immoral are detrimental to society -murder, theft, rape, etc- all of these things may not be intrinsically evil, but they're not beneficial to one doing them or society in general. So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feelings, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.
1994	If something is important enough to cover in a website, then it should be easily found within the core content of the site and not shoved into an FAQ section. I think people only ever turn to FAQ pages if they can't find what they want within the main site. When clients demand an FAQ page, I will challenge this and ask them to rethink what should be in the core copy and what is irrelevant. If the information is already within the main content, and they still want an FAQ section, they are just adding unnecessary repetition into the content. Websites should never include an FAQ section and I cant find an argument to support their use other than improving SEO.
1995	Especially since it is shunned by everyone if someone other than a dark colored person used the word. It becomes something that only one "race" can use and that is racist. If I am being to vague on why I have my opinion feel free to ask me questions. I am very interested in a debate
1996	I go to the movies a lot and it seems to happen pretty often that when the film finishes people in the audience will clap. I've never understood this as no one who had a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I could understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or there was an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience. But for normal movie-going circumstances, it just doesn't make any sense to me. Please change my view so I can stop getting annoyed when a theatre full of people clap.
1997	Not only this but anything 'intrinsic' to that person is more to do with an environment which is outside of their control than something they choose or even genetics. "Give me a child until theyre 7 and i will give you the man" The world is one big chaotic system. Literally EVERY SINGLE choice you make, even subcobscious ones come together to create your destiny so the choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
1998	Point 1 - testing is the only effective means of objective measurement and is necessary to evaluate if a system is working properly. Point 2 - education changes over time and requires ever changing curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life. Point 3 - teachers must continue to learn these new methods and changing curriculum in order to effectively lead the learning process. Point 4 - standardized testing prior to each school year would allow teachers to be moved where most effective, or removed all together if they are no longer effective at leading the learning process. Point 5 - high performing teachers could be paid more if the underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.
1999	I don't think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of a planet with life. If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life. But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe? It could be once per universe, once per galaxy or once per 100 stars. It would look the same.
2000	* Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel over the past 2 weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to cease-fire without retaliation. * Hamas declining/ignoring these opportunities of peace have left Israel with no options besides retaliation. With the main goal of Hamas being to destroy Israel; Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens. * Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles out of civilian buildings. * I believe the disregard for civilian casualties by Hamas and continual bombing of Israel is enough justification to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.
2001	Since my building is lacking an elevator (my apartment is at the 3rd floor), I keep my bike secured outdoor. About 3 weeks ago my bike got stolen. I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen as well. I'm very pissed now. There's no way I'm throwing another 80+ euros to buy a new one at a shop. I also refuse to buy a cheap one which was obviously stolen, no way I'm financing those fucking cunts. It looks like the best option remaining is starting stealing bikes on my own. Why should I not do that? Also please throw in a better alternative.
2002	With how close the world has come to annihilating itself because of leaders who've been a bit trigger happy (Cuban Missile Crisis) I truly believe nukes are pretty much the only reason the world isn't in major conflict right now. The Cold War for example. If the US and the Soviets didn't have their nuclear arsenal, what reason would Stalin, Khrushchev, etc have for NOT invading the rest of Europe? They could've easily done so and not much the US could've done to stop them. Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.
2003	I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Islamic religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts. In most places, women must cover up their breasts in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs? I invite you all to CMV.
2004	Throughout the debate with the Washington Redskins I keep hearing the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of having a team named the Detroit N*****s. This to me is illogical: First off when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context.
2005	People who know nothing of it seem to usually be slightly disdainful towards it, it's seen as being like a form of hooliganism and associated with being immature and generally bad connotations if you ask the average joe. Some wouldnt even consider it a sport. But I consider it a form of street art, on the basis that it is * fundamentally creative, everyone has their own style * a sort of artistic rebellion against the mundane, boring cityscape a lot of people are born in, it takes what to someone else is just a ledge and turns it into something fun and creative. If you're more in favor of a corporations right to take up public space with art than you are in favor to peoples desire to rebel against that with street art then fair enough I dont expect to change your mind with this and you wont change mine by saying it's against the law but if you enjoy street art you should appreciate skateboarding on some level.
2006	I think the behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off.
2007	Let me elaborate more. I don't think anyone ever 'asks to be raped'. But I think if you dress like a whore you increase your chances. So, if you dressed more conservative you reduce that chances. Women are always saying that they should not be treated like sexual objects yet they constantly dress in a way that makes men (or maybe just me) see them as objects. I'm not saying dressing *nicer* clothes will stop rape, but it couldn't hurt. This is my current view. I'm not stubborn so I want people to change their minds. I just haven't been convinced. My comeback is always, 'why put yourself in that position'. 'I don't want to get mugged, so I better avoid that alley'. Thanks.
2008	Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about the perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) consider bad, my mind trends toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say, "Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. Thanks
2009	Gravity is only a theory, therefore it should not be taught in schools because it is not absolute. A theory, as science details is not a law and we should not be teaching our kids speculative notions about the world as fact. Remove teaching the theory of gravity from schools or at least include in science class other explanations to explain the phenomena we speculatively call gravity.
2010	Quick Summary; Religion, being based on zero evidence and abstract ideas attacks intelligence and mental development of human beings. From birth to adulthood, a person is capable of understanding the values Earth and Physics has to offer unless intercepted by religion (Parents, Priest, Churches, Media etc) If easily convinced, this person is at high risk of losing the mental capabilities of being'smart' under this sense.
2011	American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking jobs. On top of that our tax money goes to pay for their childrens public education and ER visits. They don't pay into the system but steal from it. Their very status should say it all --illegal-- We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to citizenship "those who are born here = automatic citizens."
2012	not even close. owen wilson's kentucky fried accent goes in and out all movie, and the death scene in life aquatic pales to the suicide scene of luke wilson in RT. it helps that needle in the hay is playing. And the funniest 15 seconds of any wes movie (minus future man "you look like a banana" in bottle rocket) is the tennis scene.
2013	Married Life= everything in place, stability for the rest of your life, a partner whom loves and adores you so much as to make a lifetime commitment to you, respect from family and friends, and best of all HAPPINESS (otherwise, why get married in the first place?) Single Life(generally speaking)= lonely, a level of immaturity, selfishness, ignorance to making a true commitment, stuck in the memory of the 8th grade class dance! While I understand completely it varies person to person, I believe there is more respect for a married couple who truely learn life's true beauties (trust, mutual respect, lifelong commitment to another human being)
2014	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired. A chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw. I'd go down the block while spinning in a circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage. (Although if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
2015	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction--it's not the pretty part, but it's a part of the package. And while humans have a moral responsibility to moderate their impact on the natural world, we're doing more right now than any species ever has before. Would it be "enough" if it offset our impact--which is hardly "natural"-or are we supposed to save every last species, however unfit?
2016	I guess this sort of depends on what your listening to. But for the sake of argument (which is why we are here right?) I will use the example of Pink Floyd's dark side of the moon.
2017	Hardly a day goes by without a democrat politician bemoaning the fact that we have not captured/killed Osama bin Laden. However, removing bin Laden from the planet would do little or nothing to stop terrorism. Terrorists, even islamic ones in Indonesia would likely not be impressed by the death of a single man.
2018	It depends on the game genre... for FPS, RTS, MMORPGs, and racing games I prefer PC Gaming because I'm way more accurate with a mouse and keyboard than a controller, and my PC's steering wheel + gadgets make the racing games much more fun than a controller does as well. Pretty much every other genre however seems to benefit from the console controllers, side-scrollers, action RPGs, RPGs, sports, etc etc etc.
2019	1. the death penalty conflicts with the Eighth Amendment in the constitution. 2. retribution is another word for revenge based on both definitions. 3. the U.S. executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, showing that the legal system is unbalanced. 4. once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged showing mistakes had been made. 5. not enough research has been made to except the deterrence effect.
2020	The muslim integration within Britain is currently a problem. Both sides of the arguement (christians and muslims) are using the debate as a way to integrate more religious power within the country. This is why the archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration.
2021	Cats, definitely. They are independent. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and have to make sure they eat and use the facilities because they can't on their own. Cats are amazing animals and pets.
2022	Operation Eagle Claw failed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert causing damage to most of the helicopters attempting rescue of the US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran, not due to poor planning or inadequacies by the military or the administration. Consequently Carter would've easily won re-election and Ray Gun would not have been elected. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been republican presidencies and since 1968, 28 of the 44 years have been with a republican president.
2023	This is way too much of a blanket assertion, just being a "dictator" is no reason to dispose of, muche less permantely eliminate a so called dictator. Who determines who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees a nation's leader is a dictator, why assaniate he/she? There have been "benign" dictators just as their has been evil non-dictators.
2024	I think 1984 could be the 'best' in the sense that it is the most prophetic which was, to some degree, Orwells intention. I feel that 1984, like all the best products in the world fulfils its function beautifully i.e. form follows functions. However, I have to admit to not having read the other three books on the list and can consequently only offer this solitary opinion.
2025	To all those doubters, you're right no building in the history of man kind has ever had a steel frame burn to the ground, it must have been that REALLY hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that fell, completely unattached to the tower must have imploded onto itself because of the?? I forgot what I was saying, what did the Bush administration say again? Cause I'm sure that's it---they would never lie to the American public, right?
2026	I'm not saying it should be english, but there should be one official language we use to communicate with each other. We would be able to do business much better, understand everyone, and communicate ideas properly. The internet has given us all the ability to communicate with each other, all we need now is the same language. I'm not saying destroy other languages, but it would be nice to have one official one.
2027	We have something against non-Christians here? People are voting against me, a non-Christian, opening my store to appeal to any clients (Christian or otherwise) that decide there is something they need on Christmas day. Besides, anyone here ever forget some small item while entertaining? Need some batteries for the new electronic gadgets? Want to pick up pizza for the guests? Catering for Christmas day? Of course stores should be open.
2028	Had my first experience at Butterblume today. I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.
2029	So, this place is a neighborhood bar located in a not-so-great strip mall basically in an alley. For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's "regular" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together.
2030	Okay...so I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and had unlimited access to Rudy's. Loved their brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to Phx for 4 years then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes we have Rudy's but they're not nearly as accessible as they are in ATX. So I think Ive been once in 2 years. Went for a wkd trip to Phx at the end of July and low and behold what do e drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend hadn't been so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately my friend wasn't a fan of the sauce.. too peppery for her liking. I loved every second.. not so much the brisket/egg taco but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. OMFG! Delish! Well now I'm moving back to CT so I'm sure Rudy's is in my pat but I'm glad I got one last taste. Ill miss you.
2031	I visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered (6) wings and fries. The small wings / fries came in a cardboard box. The meal was over priced for the value. There is also very little room to sit and eat inside. If you are not interested in watching Fox News network, or listening to talk radio host Larry Elder, this may not be the place for you. The owner appears to be a proud black conservative and has no problem letting you know it. I would suggest no black person support this restaurant. All skin folks are not kin folks.
2032	We visited this restaurant last night and were seated on the lovely patio. The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to visit and carry on a conversation. The service was attentive and professional. We had the Brussels sprout salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and the ribeye taco platter. The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. It was truly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband and I actually split everything and it was just enough. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant.
2033	My only complaint about Kafein is the loud rave music they often have blaring in the middle of the day. The food is delicious, they have a fantastic tea selection, and the staff are friendly and competent. I get that it's a bar in the evening, but it presents itself as a welcoming place for students to study during the day, so why blast music that no one could possibly concentrate to?
2034	Although the food I have had here is generally excellent and delicious, I can't give it a 5. My biggest issue is that it's so HOT in side! Like I was sweating buckets and I'm usually the one that's always cold! And I've come here at least 4 times now and it continues to be super hot. Also the service is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes we get our food super fast and sometimes we get it super slow. Sometimes the app comes after our noodles have arrived. I don't necessarily mind that it comes after but it's weird that gyoza takes that much longer than my noodles lol. Everything is fresh tho so all in all, still good, but I really hope they fix the temperature soon!
2035	School uniform cant save a person out of cold or heat like special clothes.
2036	the kids lose their individuality and it doesn't feel like home
2037	Firefox is more respectful of W3C internet standards while soft sucks by trying to force us to use their own standards to keep their monopoly.
2038	You are asked before anything is installed for the browser.
2039	No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership. Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,' I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY?? If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)
2040	If those who have actually read a book, then there is really no debate.
2041	wow! syona i m very impressed by your views. from where did you get these unique datas,i kindly request you to submit more pts. like all these plz. don't mind my words syona, but all these special datas are accurate?reply me soon!
2042	I HAVE TO SAY BUT JUST 1 WORD: CORRUPTION.
2043	Why should India lead the world???!!! Kill all the politicians first and India will be developed tomorrow.
2044	India... where they have like a whole class of opressed people and a huge wealth differences? And with a language that the majority of the world can't understand and doesn't want to understand? India's education quality has nothing compared to Western education and it's the superpowers that control the world's economy. I highly doubt India will ever lead the world, and it doesn't even have the potential to. It should leave that to the superpowers.
2045	In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a bad father. I say this because if you have a bad father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.
2046	The Singapore Treaty is signed between Raffles, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong with Commandant under the accompanying seven ships witnessing the event.
2047	Sir Raffles is the rightful founder because he increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
2048	It was Raffles that led the expedition in order to find a new trading port and Farquhar only tagged along with him. Thus, even if Farquhar did not come Raffles would have still founded Singapore.
2049	It was Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without him, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
2050	Raffles was responsible for Singapore's boost of economy He increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
2051	God is abstract. He doesn't often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty hard to think about. Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to grasp.
2052	Actually, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history With the writing of the Old Testament I think you are referring to a time of more recent Christianity Thus the Biblical account is an argument which has been in existance much longer than your note
2053	Just because you think your opponent has been deceived one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger.
2054	IE is crap, stole the idea of tabbed browsing from all the other browsers, and you can't get extensions for it.
2055	I like those little popup windows. You don't get those with Firefox.
2056	Yes of course. Apart from the health benefits, there's the greater respect for the outdoors, sporting camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation to name but a few. Now drop and give me twenty for your insolence!
2057	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running after British presence was introduced, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
2058	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because he had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is necessary to help him solve the problems faced by the people.
2059	Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other'more useful' countries for about FOUR years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY, this shows that he was a bad developer of the country.
2060	William Farquhar had helped more citizen of Singapore than Raffles did. William Farquhar was more of a founder of Singapore than Raffles.
2061	Pro-Life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden babies are born. Pro-Choice ftw
2062	I don't want to say i officially have a position, but i want someone on the other side to answer this because i honestly just dont know: if a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro-life decision? is it then pro-life to have an abortion?
2063	What if I, my opponent, have ACTUALLY been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth? Would that make your arguments any weaker?
2064	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen? Who says that God created the Big Bang or evolution to happen?
2065	Porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people don't like them? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? Nope. If you do not like porn, don't watch it. If you like it, it is your right to watch it.
2066	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
2067	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesn't sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.
2068	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference but when you look at the whole population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.
2069	I believe that the school uniform is a good idea because school uniform improve student attendance and student doesn't spend a lot of time choosing and buying clothes for school, espeacilly girls, so they can use more time to study.
2070	i believe they are good! in this way all the girls out there would not tease each other about fashion issues and plus it makes all students look and feel equal which increases their attention on school work since they dont have to think if they are wearing the most expensive clothes in school or if they look the coolest and the prettiest and so..:D
2071	Fathers can sometimes be bad, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them. You can't have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up the most, no matter how tall you've grown.
2072	this is a load of bull excrament. These arguments are not factual and make your team seem like a bunch of foolish fools.
2073	Profits HA do you want money or do you want to live longer well without water have fun with that
2074	TV is better than books because the educational programs on TV are much more convenient and easy to understand. It is also easy to use for people who cannot see or hear. Books are also likely to be not updated with latest information about a certain topic while information from TV can be much more accurate and useful.
2075	Television uses electricity and books such as harry potter are made of trees so it causes more harm to the environment.
2076	Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottles are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur. (http://www.friendsjournal.org/bottled-water) (http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/bottled/)
2077	U.S. alone grew by over 13%. According to research and consulting done by the Beverage Marketing Corporation, the global bottled water industry has grown to over $35 billion. Americans alone paid $7.7 billion for bottled water in 2002.
2078	At Poland Spring, we know that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.
2079	From a religious standpoint gay marriage isn't even possible. Let alone right. But not everyone isn't religious or adheres to specific religious guidance. Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.
2080	I vote "Wrong". It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". And you can't exclude religion from this argument, because thats what happens when people don't have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Without it, we're lost.
2081	Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage? Which country legalized homosexual unions which led to a lower marriage rate?
2082	To me gay marriage is wrong. I respect other opinions but to me it is an unnatural way and against my moral law.
2083	I am a christian. The bible says plain out that homosexuality is wrong. Call me pathetic, weak, or whatever you want to call me, but I know for sure that the bible is the TRUTH, the WHOLE truth, and the ONLY truth.
2084	India is a good country to live in... it has diverse culture but still it unites as one. Saare jagah se achcha... Hindustan hamara...
2085	i just know that i am an indian and i don't want to show my country down and the person who thinks that only by debate they will solve all the problems is wrong. because they also know that how is their country.
2086	India does have the potential to lead the world, but so does China! America continues to outsource good manufactoring jobs to these countries resulting in an economic boost for India and China!
2087	Eh, Atheism is a pretty cool dude. Makes my logic work and doesn't afraid of anything.
2088	It is ignorant and foolish to think that god does not exist. Any other argument is completely invalid.
2089	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last resort.
2090	yea, because even though there are many other different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work so they need a little spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad
2091	I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them!!
2092	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need more than just punishment its a possibility they will do it again.
2093	Definitely Christianity :) and I am blessed to go to a Christian school where I get to learn more about our amazing God :)
2094	I found more peace in my belief and will continue to seek the Lord until the day I die.
2095	No, because they don't really understand what they are doing since they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.
2096	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
2097	The child is young and does not know what is moral and what is right.
2098	I don't think anybody would have liked to get spanked by there parents therefore, spanking shouldn't be an option
2099	Physical abuse towards children may cause them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.
2100	My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman that could possibly be schizophrenic.
2101	if a woman gets raped and is left with the chil, she should put it up for adoption. if someone murders a pregnant woman, they get charged for killing the woman and the fetus. people have the excuss that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. if you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.
2102	You are mixing topics thereby creating fallacy in your argument. The debate is not to determine under what circumstances may murder be morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy. In addition, you may want to brush up on your etymology and vary your sources rather than simply paraphrasing definitions that fit your point of view.
2103	NO WAY! There are many people in my school who are fat and two periods of PE a week and afterschool sports has NOT changed any of them even a tiny bit.
2104	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would choose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way.
2105	The "who gives a crap" button was your browser's back button. No one said you had to read this or vote on this or post a comment. It always baffles me to see people take the time to post a comment to say they don't care and everyone should stop talking about it. And another thing... people who post comments like mine make me sick.
2106	let me start by saying i feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needn't exist, however thats another debate entirely. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. In fact i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would certainley be an entertaining ceremony. far more so then any wedding i have ever attended.
2107	In my personal opinion if you better yourself in the long run you can better the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and try to fix them, or you will end up having a breakdown or something.
2108	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lying to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.
2109	I feel like a personal pursuit is better because you can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also be about happiness, love, and success.
2110	Keep our jobs at home; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which wouldn't be near what it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along anyway; vote self-raises for our political leaders; stop trying to be the world's peacemakers, money controllers - both providing and then forgiving debt only to "loan" more; and realize that all the world has the same abilities and resources we started with, they just need to make a choice to utilize the resources they have and develope a work ethic and use them.
2111	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty. But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq.The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the Glaring eyes & stance when in court he recently told the judge"I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?"
2112	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
2113	If an employer fires you,they have to pay any wages owed to you plus any other compensation (vacation pay,etc.) on the spot. As a manager,you are responsible for those under you and the money. If your boss has to prove you took the money,but you might be able to get your job back-talk to the state or Federal Dept. of Labor. You could possibly sue for Wrongfull Termination if your boss can't prove you took the money.
2114	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness. However there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people. Instead they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.
2115	If he is unhappy about your dogs. Then that's where your problem is. Either you find a good home for the dogs or train your dogs or move out to a house to keep neighbourly peace. But its really up to you. Most likely he is gathering evidence that your dog is indeed behaving badly or out of control. If your dogs are really doing something that is damaging or noisey then it would be a good idea to train the dogs. I've lived in an apartment and co-operation and sensitivity and tolerlance is sometimes not easy. But such is the life of living in an apartment. Two wrongs doesn't make a right. How many options do you have? You can't evict the guy. More complains to the authorities is not going to get you anywhere.
2116	Blackmail is where you offer NOT to reveal some embarrassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act: obtaining or procuring something by illegal means, such as by force or coercion. Here there is neither force or coercion. However, one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be. I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal (I assume?), it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
2117	diabetes is a condition that is built up over time. you can't sue your company for a condition that you may have been prone to get due to poor health, eating habits or just outright laziness. removing your pituitary gland will not cause you to get diabetes. you probably had diabetes but never knew it until they did the operation to remove your gland. Sorry, but the company is only responsible for an injury you sustained while on the job and if you leave your job, your next job should provide you health coverage.
2118	I missed the last change by a few months, so I know how unpopular this sounds. Kids seem to be older, wearing makeup, hair gel, stylish clothing, and designer accessories in elementary school. I wished I could look like an adult when I was small.
2119	I can't find ANY good ethical arguments. You mean good unethical ones to rationalize his actions. Didn't Hitler think the same way? For the good of the many means violating the US Constitution. And it really isn't fiction is it? You just need some ammunition. Well you won't get it here! And there was nothing ethical about nuking Japan. Truman was led to believe they were military targets, when in fact most were women and children. There wasn't a military target in sight! And we didn't have to nuke 2 cities!
2120	white males are slowly becoming the minority. sorry, but, no; i don't think there will be laws protecting whites. i don't think there should be ANY law like that. if you can do the job and do it well i don't think it should matter if you are white, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female. just do the job and get paid.
2121	For the same reason you have to pay for hair cuts, lawyers services, tax services, and doctors visits. There are expenses incurred in providing a service including salaries.
2122	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can say anything you want as long as it doesn't cause the harm of others. You can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, but you can speak out against your government or any other group. The problem is that people don't limit their actions to speech. Furthermore, our country is a lot better then pretty much any other and all you people who want to complain so much, just leave and you'll find out what it's like to be oppressed.
2123	He drives too fast for you? Speed up yourself as much as possible. If he is speeding or driving recklessly, then the cops can ticket him. There is no law that says the managers must hold back pizzas just so you can deliver them. In fact, it goes against every cannon of customer service. The faster the delivery the better (as long as nobody gets injured).
2124	They don't, they have a free and open society and although they are traditionally Christian, muslims are allowed to build mosques anywhere and way they want, and are even free to live in segregated communities. They don't even need to learn the language to collect on health and welfare benefits of their host country. The outcry comes when Muslims begin demanding that their new Christian neighbors not offend them with their traditional European ways of free speech, freedom in sexuality, and drinking good beer. Some Islamic leaders even begin demands of a separatist state for their small communities within the borders of traditional European countries. Its absolutely ridiculous that generosity and guest treatment are abused by some Muslims so horribly.
2125	Well, first off, incest is not always "child abuse." Sex between closely related CONSENTING adults probably happens. In the USA, incest is not common. There is a stereotype about the south, that it happens there a lot. This is untrue. In fact, the highest rates of incest in the USA are found in among hispanics. Furthermore, incest is RAMPANT in Central and South America. Love Jack
2126	Brian Doyle not only got what he deserved he should have gotten it for the last time he did it. Without law enforcement being able to improvise criminals would run amok in this country.
2127	No I haven't but (it sounds like its a friend) and it sounds like she can get help through a pro-bono place, or a low income based legal services. You would be surprised at what some places consider LOW INCOME. My sister's husband brings home at least $400.00 a week (in winter) and at least $60.00 a week (in summer), and they have a 3 person household. They get approx. $46,000 a year bring home and they get help from W.I.C, Daycare Asst., food excetra. So tell her, or help her, find those services.
2128	Absolutely not. It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt. You are better off not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors. Thank God we haven't reached a point in this country where EVERYTHING that you SHOULD do you MUST under penalty of law. This is a free country, right?
2129	YES! What good does it do to punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free? Throw the potheads in prison??? What kind of logic is this? Just because it has been illegal forever doesn't mean that it's right. "It's illegal for a reason". Well, spitting in the street is in some places too. Should we throw you in jail for that? Bet, the same idiot that I quoted would be throwing a fit if he was written a ticket for spitting in the street. Luckily, there is some reform going on in some states and in many parts of California now, it's pretty much ignored. Those interesed in this should get with NORML. It's the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
2130	I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view... Historically, when human rights were being defined, women were not included. For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.. Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of "human rights" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the "human rights" that men have. In a nutshell, when someone says "women's rights" they are talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific. I hope this helps.
2131	i think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly that world you describe: - in the united states women are paid only 75 for every $1.00 a man is paid for the identical work. - 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world living in poverty are women. - two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls. - 75% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women. - women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet only earn 10% of the world's income and own less than 1% of the world's property. tell me exactly, how we're on such an even keel? how can anyone NOT be a feminist?
2132	If you get caught, then the theater manager has the discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back. This is dishonest-- it is stealing. If you paid to see one film, and then sneak in to see a second film, then you have cheated the theater out of ticket sales. You also may be affecting the box office totals for the film you saw but didn't pay to see. People do this all the time and get away with it, but it is still not right.
2133	The principle here is not that they are able to kill people but for what reason. The execution of a known felon who has committeded crimes deemed irreconcilable in the eyes of the community is not a crime nor hyprocracy but justified and necessary. As for war it depends on the reason, to the defence of life and country it is a noble cause, for an outster of a regime not friendly to a country that is selfcentered hyprocracy for a nation that cherishes life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
2134	If he prescribed the meds, he bears the legal responsibility, but it's possible that he doesn't actually have access to the records. Whatever the case, your access to your medical records is guaranteed by federal law. Whoever owned the facility would be responsible for maintaining those records. In general, I agree with these other guys. He knows he's in trouble and he's trying to wiggle out.
2135	I think the birth mother should have the right for "no contact." There could, however, be an intermediary who could be contacted in the event of a medical emergency. Women need to have this safeguard so they won’t feel pressured by the judgemental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It’s very sad that abortions are frequently chosen because of these reasons.
2136	I disagree because, well I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune. I owe no one! I will walk on anyone who tries to take from me, what I have worked for! Me and my brother were the only white kids in the projects... Talk about unfair! Take your cry for reparations to someone else... I simply don't buy it!
2137	The scarlett letter license plates will not pass because there are those that hold high political offices or other esteemed jobs that have been caught for exactly that thing. Do you think that they want to drive around with a scarlett letter license plate? This is the only reason this bill has repeatedly been defeated. Now if it was just Joe Smoe who was getting busted for the DUIs and not the senators, congressmen, etc, you bet it would pass. As for Imani who answered before me, shed better be glad she doesnt live where I do, because that is exactly what one of the judges in our county has people to do. I personally would think it is a deterrent and would think long and hard about doing something wrong if I had to do something like that. If you commit a crime you will be required to pay society back one way or the other.
2138	Many wish he would be. The reality is, if he does ; then there would be great uproar. The American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower bracket earners. The woes would just be unbearable!! The economy of the USA would be negatively affected or even bought down lower that it already is. The fact is : Bush is using the "Born again church" to his advantage. Is he a Christian - Very much questionable, no signs of it. Hah! He is as much Christian as Bin Laden is Muslim.
2139	No one should be treated like less than any other person based on the "accident of birth" such as their sex or race. In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not the color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. If you can meet the criteria for a job you should not be judged by factors you were born with. No one has a right to discriminate against you or target you for scapegoating. Every person matters, man or woman, physically fit or handicapped, whether of European, African, Asian or Native American, etc. ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is.
2140	i think it sounds like we are becoming an communistic country trying to pass a law like that there is more to obesity then buying to much food... some obese people dont eat much but what they are eating is junk and empty calories... some try to buy healthy and get things like slim fast full of preservitives and poisons... some just dont exercise.. maybe we should pass a law for mandatory exercise!.... or health and nutrition classes... maybe we should stop selling a bunch of junk maybe we should make organic and natural foods more affordable
2141	You had a child with this person and you are going to have to SHARE parenting time with this person, unless you can prove in some way that this person is an unfit parent or is in the process of commiting crimes of some kind.. Truthfully, this person DESERVES to have parenting time and influence in the course that this child's life is going..
2142	Well, a private attorney in a murder case is going to cost you between 30 and 50 thousand dollars. So if you don't have that kind of money, you might not have a choice. In general, public defenders are decent enough attorneys. But their main problem is they tend to be overworked. I mean, they are buried in work. This gives them less time to devote to even the most important cases.
2143	You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.
2144	First of all, what your stepson is doing is libel, because it is in written form. Slander is oral, which he may also be doing, but since he's sending letters, it's libel. If you're serious about stopping him, start with the police. Libel laws vary from state to state, it may not be a criminal matter in New York, and they will be able to tell you that. If it is a civil matter, speak with an attorney about bringing a case against your stepson and what a reasonable expectation of the outcome might be. It might not be worth the time, effort, and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.
2145	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things will still happen to you. Conversely you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. I see it everywhere, employers or bosses that treat some stuff like shit but are financially successful. People who do right by other people sometimes but get nothing in return. I dont like it, but I see it often. If life were fair, inncocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor.
2146	I've lost all hope for a progressive movement in this country. I have been defending him for 6 years to all my conservative friends (in a *very* red State) while he: kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the GOP alternative to single payer, kept the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA, etc, etc. Hillary Clinton will probably win the Democratic primary, and will probably be the next President, and if anything she will be even less progressive than the disappointment that is Obama. Please, change my view before I become a 25 year old husk of a man
2147	Let me begin by saying I love bulldogs, pugs and dogs in general. However due to designer breeding, these short nose type of dogs have terrible problems breathing and a host of other health problems are generally expected. Every bubble of air is a struggle, which is probably a factor of why they sleep so much and probably is a cause for several of those health problems. I suppose there is optional surgery to increase airflow, but the vast majority of owners don't opt to do it. It breaks my heart to see these amazing dogs gasping for air, I can imagine all the health problems I'd have if I had to struggle with every breath. If I am misinformed please help, I'd love to own a beautiful bully but I'd feel terrible for all these reasons.
2148	Through my experience as an undergraduate engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.
2149	We have been watching a CNN special in school about genocides after the holocaust. The piece believes that the US should have intervened in the conflicts. I think that the US was right not to do anything. I don't think it is the responsibility of America to help anyone. I feel like things like this put the US in a bad position. If we do nothing, we are viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower. But if we go in, we look like we are being oil seeking imperialists. So I don't think the US should be fighting other peoples fights. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort them selves out. Change my view! Thanks to anyone who responds.
2150	This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas... several kilos of food here for less than £4. If you have a big enough freezer you can even buy chicken breast in bulk thatll last months (£48/10kg here)...and then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain healthy food is expensive)
2151	I think that sports in general are a tremendous waste of time, energy and money and that they are a distraction from the things in our society that truly need our attention. I think far too much effort, manpower and resources, both mental and physical are poured into meaningless feats of strength. These resources could be used to truly change our society for the better. The entertainment and camaraderie are a benefit of sports, but I believe that could be achieved on a smaller scale, freeing up massive resources which could be used for the true betterment of mankind.
2152	Most people, most of the time, rather than form an unbiased opinion (if such a thing even exists) about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons - a gut feeling, if you will. (Edit: Please disregard my title; it is too general, whereas the last sentence presents my claim more precisely.) This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds. However, most political discussions end with both parties saying what amounts to "Your arguments are less convincing than mine." There is some "meta" reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason, which is the *actual* reason for the person's opinion, is not rational.
2153	I hope that didn't come out as too crazy sounding or confusing. But basically I was talking with my parents who are both vehemently religious and I made a realization that while religion does contribute to wars, the biggest problem that religion is that it prevents the spread of advancement in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (with issues in climate change and evolution), and society, specifically with same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, et cetera.
2154	I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism?
2155	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and tossed them in to the water. I cant find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, faught for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over. I did not like it. Except... I DID. Fishers... change my view?
2156	In my opinion, the Tories are all a bunch of selfish money hoarding bastards who don't give a shit about anyone except themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman whose previous title is minister of women and equality but who also voted against gay marriage. She's highly in favour of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of the country (like academies and raising tuition fees even further) and I doubt that anything will change from Gove's reign of terror - We may even see it get worse.
2157	I believe natural rights, i.e. *"...those not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable..."* do not exist. I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth. To clarify, I am defining a "right" as a guarantee of access to a commodity or state of being, without necessarily referring to a legal structure. Please, CMV!
2158	I've always looked at someone recording a video while holding the device vertically as a mouth-breather. I know its a very trivial issue, but it just annoys me that someone doesn't take into consideration how the video will look later when its being watched later on YouTube/Facebook/whatever. Many times people end up covering 2/3's of screen with black bars, or even stretching &amp; blurring the sides. These videos **always** look terrible. The only reason I've ever been able to come up with is if the person recording only intends to ever watch it on the same device. But eben then, why would you want a video that's only intended to be watched on a phone?
2159	It was after I did some research and talked to friends and family that I personally learned how big this vaccinations and anti vaccinations topic is. In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not kids get vaccinated. Some people don't get vaccinated and live long healthy lives and some people do and the same thing happens. I would assume this is because of our biology. Of course vaccinated people get sick and people who aren't vaccinated get sick. My conclusion is why should people be forced to vaccinate kids if they don't want to.
2160	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. This begs the question: external source of consciousness or internal source of consciousness? We could just as easily be a host for consciousness which has an external source, as we could be just a random accidental chemical self-awareness.
2161	In light of the screw job that recently befell Croatia vs. the host nation of Brazil, in the first round of the World's Cup, I am reminded of why I can't stand Soccer (Football).
2162	Let's say that he continues with the plan to move the Jews to Madagascar or does nothing at all to them. He conquered a lot more land than Napoleon or Rome and in a shorter amount of time. He brought great empires like Russia, France and UK almost or to their knees. Something that the Germans of the previous generation wished they could do during WWI. He made Germany rise from the ashes like a phoenix and get revenge for Versailles. He also planned the Autobahn which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I believe that if it weren't for the horrors of genocide Germans would be a lot more proud of their history.
2163	You see the videos of people getting surprised at their graduation or at school/work by a military member coming home. You think wow that's nice how happy they are. But think about it. Especially in the case of a graduation, the child has to then go days or *weeks* with the disappointing thought that mom or dad isn't going to be there. That's sucks. If it were me, I'd rather be saved that heartache in the first place rather than get surprised. I'd want to know immediately that my mom or dad or son was coming home early. Making me feel sad about it longer than necessary, and **lying** to me is a dick move. Would anyone who has been surprised by a military family member please chime in?
2164	I often read people talking about the idea of natural rights which are universal and inalienable. I contend such rights are simply constructs, and have no basis beyond any other construct humanity has created. While there can be some appeal to human nature, nearly all universal behaviour that could be classified as rights only apply to the "in-group" and certainly none seem to apply to humanity as a whole. The extension of rights to cover everyone is a construct, and not part of fundamental human nature. This is why law exists in general. It's an extension of tribal self-rule for larger groups. There is certainly nothing about the nature of reality that causes rights to exist. I'd like to hear some good arguments as to why rights are not constructs.
2165	I realise that this has been asked before but I'd like to get some fresh thoughts. So, the US has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). The US donates more money to charity/aid organisations than any other country. The US tends to be the entertainment capital of the world (I realise that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying over all: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games). The US has most of the greatest universities in the world. I get that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, &amp;c. ad infinitum). But that being said, for the US to not be the best country another country has to be declared the best. So who is it? The UK? China? Make your case.
2166	Neither one of these 2 Italian crooners were realy gifted singers IMO Between the 2, Dino had the better voice, more range and better tambre, Dino's early inspirations, his model singers when he was a aspiring singer were more blues and jazz based Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space anf timing far better than Martion. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither are jazz singers, The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians yet rarely have any of Dino's songs have.
2167	1. I'm amazed that they havn't permanently (spell?) put duct tape over Biden's mouth. The stupid things that come out of this guy's mouth.... 2. Between an apparant lack of a real understanding of just how bad things really were (read the article), a congress that didn't even read the entire bill, poor economic philosophy from the get go, and a bill that has so much Pork in it, it could be Porky the Pig reincarnated to a piece of legislation, this package is a TERRIBLE idea. YAY for the Barry-O and his lovely, lovely administration.
2168	We didn't impeach GW so why on earth did we impeach Clinton? All he did was get his knob polished, GW sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that have cost thousands of lives, and trash our name throughout the world. What Clinton did should have remained between him and Hill', its no worse than what other great presidents did. Hell, Cheney shot his friend in the head and didn't apologize. That is a trick, you shoot your friend in the head and they apologize to you...
2169	We are just people at the end of the day and if knowone likes same sex relationships its there problem. I think that gay and lesbian couples are not hurting anyone so whats the big problem. They should be happy and not live a lie! you can argue and say that god made a man and a women but i dont think that god would want you to be unhappy thats the main thing!
2170	PCs are cheaper with more powerful hardware. Mac's use generic hardware, not specific apple hardware as is often believed. People also believe that Mac's breakdown or need to be replaced less often than PCs. However, if you ever work in an environment (as I have) where Macs are networked together and used as the primary computer, you will see that Macs are just as perceptible to problems as Pcs. In fact, we bought a number of Pro machines, which had a 100% failure rate in the 3 or so years they were used.
2171	In the Lion King, a Good Character actually dies, which gives the movie a much more serious and dramatic undertone than Aladdin. Besides my personal preference for drama!, this also makes the movie more layered and thus suitable for more kinds of people, which means there's a bigger target audience, which makes the potential revenue bigger. Plus, the Lion King got more Academy Award Nominations than Aladdin, so there!
2172	Yeah, it is. A religious debate accomplishes nothing. rather insults are passed and one side or the other is seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because somebody quotes scientific or Biblical 'evidence' that may or may not exist or be a firm as is made sound. Furthermore, speaking for both sides, both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so each side will just pick each other apart as able.
2173	California is the best! - A land of opportunity - If it was a country, it would have the tenth largest economy in the world (as estimated by CIA) - Free from some of the kinds of hate/racism that you see in other states. - Contains some of the most beautiful natural landscapes and destinations in the world. - Birthplace of technology and the new frontier for the modern world. - Good weather.
2174	It's ZED people!!! When you are talking to someone over the phone and you need to spell something that has the letter ZED, it's clear as day when you say ZED. If you're talking to a Yankee and are forced to say ZEE you get a lot of this "did you say V? Or was that a D?" Let's change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
2175	Of course it is. I would compare the situation with the lead up to the Iraq war. There are those in government who are making accusations and then trying to build intelligence around those accusations. What is supposed to be done is to assess the intelligence first and come to your conclusions based on the intelligence. Israel and the U.S. have a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. We have helped Israel become a nation that relies on terror and violence against opposition instead of balancing strength with diplomacy. Well if Israel decided to preemptively attack Iran unjustly you can bet there will be blind support from the U.S. government. This revelation should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.
2176	Whatever most young people are listening to or MTV or Z100 plays. The trendy stuff basically. Right now it is the insanely idiotic rap music with the constant references to money and cars and bullshit and fake gangsta crap. They are so corny they have those terrible songs that come wrapped together with some stupid ass dance like that little moron solja boy. Yeah that about sums it up.
2177	No. The suicide (particularly of young people) is not only a drain on the country (education and the like) but also means the loss of the potential contributions that person could make to society. Others are probably going to argue that if people really want to end their life then it is cruel to keep them alive. I disagree. People can change their minds about these things. I think more work and thought (not just money), should be put into suicide prevention. Suicide is a trajedy we CAN prevent.
2178	We see different colours all the time, but most of them are shades of other colours. For instance, the Rebecca Black Friday music video. When she is singing about how today is Friday, there is a weird and very exotic purple that appears on the screen. I had never seen that shade of purple before in my life and my brain did not explode.
2179	(1)Share prices across the world have continued to fall, with market indicators this week reaching record lows in the US, Europe and Japan. Many analysts believe that the US economy is heading for a recession. President Bush went public this week, urging investors not to panic. Political uncertainties in Japan are hitting shares there and many other financial epicentres. (2)A stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.
2180	You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money? I don't see a point in making a change from an economic standpoint.
2181	AGENTS. this is callcenter. its should already be a cliche. eventhough management is the one creating the "strategy", if its not favorable to the AGENTS, then the management is useless, they need to come up with another plan... unless the "power" kicks in that agents wont be able to do anything but to follow.
2182	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth you need proof to validate your claim. If you refuse to give your fellow man this proof you're hiding the truth from him.You hindering his or her ability to encounter the truth,and quite frankly if he or she was to die thereafter and was condemned for eternity Is their blood not on your hands? You had the means to save them but didn’t. If you can’t offer proof of your beliefs thats ok, just don’t promote it as truth, promote it as belief.
2183	Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy. Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment. For example, humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when absolutely everything discovered about it. Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof. Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.
2184	Had a great experience here! My date had prime rib and I had a burger with 3 different types of meat in it I believe. My date loved the prime rib and her mashed potatoes and my burger was cooked to a perfect medium. In fact the burger was incredible, just writing this review makes me want to go get another now. Only downside I would have to say was the Mac and cheese. I did get to speak with the manager and he said it's a new item and they are working on the item. We r definitely going back!
2185	Cool atmosphere... almost like your in a wooden cabin. Fits in well with the Canadian 'comfort-food' theme. I've had a few dishes here, the lobster roll, PEI mussels, & boneless back rib burger, all of which I'd recommend. The daily noodle however, is scarce - I've missed it all three visits. Alas, perhaps next time, as I will surely be going back.
2186	Went in on a Monday night. There were several servers there however, none came to take our drink order for 15 minutes so we left. Manager came by at one point and asked how we were doing as he walked by, but he asked and kept walking. Why ask how I'm doing if you clearly don't care or want to know why which is evidenced by the pace of your gate around the restaurant.
2187	The food was really good and our server Samantha (I think) was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have went back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it.
2188	I've tried 2 curries and pad Thai and all were very good. The service was great and we got free ice cream!
2189	Not a good experience here. The place was not too busy and everything was just so slow. The staff was overworked I guess. The food when I came out 1 hour later, was not very good. Don't order the mushroom stroganoff. It was inedible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms to tough to chew. We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it was really not fun.
2190	I was extremely disappointed in the food portions for the price point or maybe I'm just bitter that this place took over Messinis. I gave 1 star because I had high expectations = fail, it had big shoes to fill (messinis) = fail, food portions for price point = fail, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good but it better be if it costs $7. I will always try a new place once. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place or go back again.
