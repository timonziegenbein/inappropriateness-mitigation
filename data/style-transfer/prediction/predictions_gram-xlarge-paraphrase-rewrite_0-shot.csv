0	Students ought to wear what they wish, and be comfortable with their clothing.
1	People shouldn't have to wear school uniforms, they have their own choice if they want or don't want to wear school uniforms. I think every principal should reconsider his position on school uniforms.
2	I think the word "indisputable" doesn't mean the same thing you think it means. I'm disputing your claim based on personal experience, that's why it's disputable.
3	I'd never turn her in, 'cause she's my wife, and she's made a mistake, but we'll get over it. If she believed in me when she told me what she did, then she wouldn't have done that.
4	No, I'm not going to turn in my husband, just because my wife killed somebody. People do stupid things.
5	TV's a terrible thing, except maybe Spongebob, which is a good show, but most TV is terrible, so I'm going to say books.
6	I'm very fond of books, of getting lost in them, and they improve your literature, or so my English teacher told me :P
7	I'd point out that you don't need a reading device or electricity when you read a book.
8	I'm thinking books are superior to TV, because they're more realistic, and I can take you to the whole North World, and they're educational.
9	Books are like medicine, they awaken the soul, they don't destroy children's morality, they raise questions, they take readers into mystical places, paradise, even the kitchen sink, they alter the way we look at life and often give us a feeling of relativity.
10	India has strong military neighbors (China & Pakistan)...India has bad relations with Pakistan because of territorial disputes, which have led to four wars, and as for China, its relations with India have also become tense due to the growing tension in the region due to the growing conflict and interference by India in Pakistan, such as the Pakistani Economic Corridor and the Gawadar Mega Oil City.
11	stupid India, they're really bad, so BOO IDEA BOO!
12	India's a good adopter, but a bad developer, and the leader should be a great developer.
13	Russell Peters's a master at mocking people like that.
14	According to a recent report, 50% of NASA's scientists are Indian IITians. Just imagine how our status,value, and astronomical knowledge of India would increase if these scientists joined ISRO. Now,think about IITians,students who pass IIT. They are known to be superbrain. If India is capable of opening hightech institutions,then why we are unable to provide them with a perfect job at their level.We are giving international status of education.then why we are unable to take best advantages from them. This is due to brain drain,lack of industrial development,suitable working environment,as well as proper salary.so it's the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
15	I honestly wish I was completely fatherless, not saying that it's better to not have a father, but a bad father. I believe you can grow up completely fatherless and without any significant male role models and still be successful. For example, consider myself: I spent my first thirteen years of life completely fatherless, and those were the essential times a child needs to be close to his father, and I turned out great. So, yes, I would rather be completely fatherless, rather than having a bad father who would somehow affect me and shape me into half a man.
16	Although being fatherless is probably the hardest thing in the world, which no one wants to go through, I'd rather be fatherless than dealing with someone who makes me mad every day.
17	During Raffles's visit to Singapore, Farquhar followed him, so it seems that Raffles saw Singapore before Farquhar, which makes him the founder.
18	Raffles had written his discovery incorrectly, on February 29, 1819; this was later corrected. He had believed that he had discovered Singapore on his first voyage.
19	Without doubt Raffles' ambition and vision were the reason for him to look for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and for him to choose Singapore as the best place for British economic and strategic goals in the region.
20	Raffles had established a local court in Singapore, which had jurisdiction over activities such as public gambling and slavery. Farquar had protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and had attracted traders while Raffles was away.
21	It's interesting, because you have the burden of proof that we're still evolving. I don't know about anyone else, but I haven't seen any change in human shape in a couple of thousand years. Another question: with this whole "big bang" theory, it seems that all of this would have blown up in that big bang, and not come together.
22	I'm a nurse, and the more I studied biology, the more I admired the wonders in our bodies. Each tiny cell has a design even more intricate than a computer. If you look at a computer, do you question the necessity of a creator, or do you require evidence that this highly structured machine was brought into existence by accident or divine intervention?
23	Although I voted for evolution, creation is more easily accepted because someone must have changed some aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.
24	It's like thinking that if you believe in evolution, it's possible to solve a puzzle by removing all the pieces and then putting them back together.
25	Firefox and add-ons are leaking memory like a sieve. In Task Manager on Windows, a Firefox session with three tabs and a week, 250MB of memory is consumed.
26	Physical education should be mandatory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really hate sports, then you can stop when you're an adult, but when you're a kid, it's better to study, play and exercise than to be lazy and lie on the couch all day.
27	In my opinion, a founder is a leader who is respected by the organization or group he leads. Raffles and Farquhar were great leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent to Britain, more people volunteered to send him than all those who sent Raffles on three occasions. This shows that Singaporeans respected Farquhar more than Raffles and that they considered him to be a better leader.
28	The only other option is adoption or keeping him, and I know a lot of kids are adopted, but a lot of them aren't, and maybe it's better to just abort, so they don't have to suffer, that's the chance they take, but who are we to decide whether a woman is pregnant or not?
29	Who are we to decide what's good and bad? Shouldn't we let people decide for themselves and live with the consequences?
30	We're evolving, look this up; every generation, our little toe gets smaller and smaller, until we lose it. It's a tiny, simple, apparently useless appendage, and who cares about it? It's evolution in action.
31	I'm aware people have religious beliefs and so on, and I think it's okay for them to do what they want without being judged for every move they make, but evolution is scientifically proven to be correct. What's your point?
32	That's a red herring. Monkeys haven't evolved to talk, (I guess you mean speech, by which I assume you mean English), because they can't talk. We, on the other hand, have evolved to talk. Yes, if we're descended from monkeys, that doesn't mean that monkeys can't exist. We're just a branch off the tree of life, not a dead end.
33	Porn isn't bad, if it was bad, then it would've been "Illegal". It's the "Erotic" needs of people who don't have a partner.
34	Porn isn't intrinsically bad, because it doesn't really harm anyone who doesn't participate in it willingly. It's really that simple.
35	They're all virgins, or they live with their mothers and can't watch porn.
36	It's not bad, and when you talk about actors playing this scene, it's their choice, they love it, and it's no disrespect to women that they want to play it. We have free expression, you see, and it's also good for some of us to be open about sex.
37	There was a rapper who said he was the people's champion. Sometimes you have to take care of the common good, because that's what people want. Personally, I think it's a better idea to serve the common good, because if you always think about yourself and your personal goals, you'll become a conceited jerk. And a jerk is someone who doesn't get along with people, and when he's alone and he's not liked by anybody, he gets lonely.
38	I think there are different ways to feel good and proud of what you're doing, I feel good when I help other people, but that doesn't mean I help every single person that comes my way, I just try to do the best and the right thing to make someone happy.
39	I'm of the opinion that societal good is superior to personal interest, because it's more beneficial to assist other people. I feel good when I assist others, because it gives me a sense of purpose, that I'm doing the right thing.
40	It's good, because it shows that the school and everybody else accepts everybody, no matter where they are from, who they are or what their religion is.
41	You'll be sure to go to school to learn, not to show off your fashion sense, when you wear your school uniform.
42	I'm half-admitted that wearing whatever you like is fun and inventive, but only if everyone can do it, and some kids can't do it, so uniforms would make social life a lot easier, and the school would look more grown up.
43	The school uniform is a very good idea, why? Because the school uniform makes students focus more on their studies than on their clothes, and I think it's a good idea to have a uniform at school, because it makes students more disciplined, and they have a more equal status in terms of material things.
44	I know a bad father is terrible, and probably won't do all the things a great father would do, but at least you know you have someone who is your father. People can change. You can't always feel the way you do about someone your whole life. There's a time in his life when he realizes he needs to be there for you, if you don't have a dad, that's not going to happen.
45	There's scientific evidence that having a mother and a father is the best way to develop physically and mentally, so a bad father is better than none, but obviously, if he's not abusive. Also, people change. Who says he's bad forever? There's family therapy sessions you can go to.
46	I believe that people are capable of changing and becoming better people. I'd rather hope that my dad would be a good dad than know that I'll never see him. I'd be too curious about what kind of dad he could have been.
47	The next level thinks it's the next level. Atlas would have thrown the world away to shake hands with him.
48	The increase in bottled water production has led to increased water extraction near bottling plants, causing water shortages that affect local consumers and farmers. Additionally, for every gallon of water used to produce plastic, two gallons of water are lost during purification, before it is bottled.
49	Water bottles are easy to turn into fiber material for the long term, such as clothing or carpet. Simply fill the cup with water and use it again.
50	TV's a hell of a lot better than books from the old days!
51	TV's better than books dathu ihfej tijkjdrk xtklp09 guil09 sfjiiytg dh,lut457 p[];o;l
52	I'm very fond of TV, I can watch anything I like and it's great. You can watch DVDs and play Playstation on TV.
53	The average American recycles 86-88% of their bottles of water, that's over half! So stop complaining that we don't recycle, because we do! http://www.treehugger.com/culture/23-percent-of-americans-donatmt-recycle.html
54	Without plastic water bottles, there's no sunshine. There's only darkness.
55	Until we get out of this recession, we can ban water bottles!
56	I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexuals, that it be called "civil unions." "Moreover, the effects on society are bound to be minimal..." That is the kind of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with a small relative impact? "...why challenge any assumption?" I'm not arguing that the law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that the law should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my rebuttal to res0ndf7 for more on this line.
57	There's nothing like "gay marriage", there's only marriage between man and woman.
58	I'm an American and I'm ashamed to admit "Merica is wealthy because of slavery, India never had slavery and was wealthy before the British arrived and took everything away. We were left in a bad condition, but we were quick to develop. India is much more competitive in education than America and soon, when all of India will have education, which will happen in our lifetime, it will be great. India has the potential."
59	India is a secular country, and there are people from all religions living here. India knows about almost every country and how they live, so it can easily lead the world without creating any nuisance for anyone.
60	How can Indians say they don't have the potential to lead the world? India's heaven on Earth, and only India has the potential to lead the world. Believe in yourself and your hard work, and India will surely become the world's potential leader, more than any other country!
61	I'm saying no, because spanking isn't really solving the issue, and anyone can get over a spanking quick, and then do whatever they did before, so it's better to be strict than abuse a child.
62	It depends on how severe the killing is, I'd empathize with my husband and wish him to be free, but if I knew it was an evil act, not self-defense, or defending his family or possessions, I'd probably just leave and wouldn't be interested in anything.
63	I'd say I'd report them, 'cause I don't believe killing somebody and getting away with it is right, and I wouldn't want to be in bed with a murderer.
64	I'd definitely turn them in, even if it pains me. A murderer shouldn't get away with murder, because if he did it once, he can do it again, and it's dangerous to have him around. Plus, if I don't turn her in, then I don't know if I'll ever be a victim of hers.
65	The government doesn't have a place telling women what they can do with their bodies, ever. But they do have this right. For example, in many states it's illegal for a woman to be a prostitute, for her to take illegal drugs into her body, for her to murder people, for her to steal, for her to show her naked body in public, and so on. And that's not all. The government tells us what to do with our bodies all the time, and this is no exception.
66	I'm for life, and this is a question for those who favor abortion: Is the child in the mother's belly alive, and if not, how do you know?
67	It's legal to abort a child when he's born in Nebraska, what are your arguments against that?
68	There's no argument about that, really. No matter how you see a fetus, it's still a living creature that was created intimately. You shouldn't change what mothernature, God, fate, or whatever has decided for you. And if you don't want to get pregnant in the first place, don't have sex or use protection. Yes, there are some women who get raped, and it's very unfortunate, but they should give the baby up for adoption. It's not the baby's fault that it was created, so why should the raping creature have to pay the highest price for its life?
69	There are many ways to avoid getting pregnant, condoms are 99% effective for men and women, morning after pills are 75% effective, patches, pills and other forms of not getting pregnant. It's the woman's fault she didn't use them. And maybe instead of "choice" vs. "life", they should have "life" with exceptions (i.e. women who get raped), so that it's equal for everyone.
70	It's a good argument when a woman is raped, but why would you punish an innocent child for some other man's crime? If the woman doesn't want the child, she can give it up for adoption. I just don't understand why you would kill the child. Emotional trauma would be the same without the child.
71	I'm in favor of gay marriage. Many people who don't support it are simply not comfortable with homosexuality in general, so their opponents tend to be prejudiced. If two people are happy, love each other, and want to remain together forever, why should they not be allowed to marry?
72	Marriage is found almost everywhere, even in societies that have never been touched by Christianity or Judaism, and even in societies that have been around before Christianity or Judaism. Christianity can be said to be the origin of Christian marriage, but that is difficult to prove.
73	You can't just pick someone's lifestyle because you don't like it, and call it a "choice" when you're not that person, and you know that being gay isn't a choice.
74	If you're against gay marriage and think it's bad, then don't watch a gay couple kiss. Who are you to say people have an incorrect view of the world, that they need to change their feelings, that they're obviously wrong? In the meantime, everyone has a right to their opinion, but keep it to themselves. Don't try to change other people based on your beliefs. It's selfish and takes away one's own rights.
75	It seems to me that personal goals are more important, because first you need to help yourself, and that may seem selfish, but when you become good at what you do, then you can help others do the same, so you're helping yourself and you're helping others.
76	Sallu, thank you for your answer. Politics is very helpful to people. The nation we live in is built on laws and values that people support. Without police I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretically. Why don't terrorists blow up every city here? Are you frisked every time you leave your house? No. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don't have to always be right but take time to learn.
77	Perhaps me: 1. I despise Bush's Christian ethos, which he's trying to force upon this country. 2. I'm a pagan, which means I'm not a Christian, and thus I'm a threat. 3. I'm bisexual, and have had sex with men, which means I'm a threat. 4. I don't agree that what Bush is doing is good for this country. 5. And #6. I'm an individualist, which means that the choices that we make in our lives are our own; rules, government, ect should be about protecting our individual safety, not about controlling how we live our lives, either spiritually or in the material world. Because of this, I'm an anti-socialist, which makes me a direct threat to the government Bush is trying to form. Therefore, I'm sure that my name is somewhere on his long list of "offenders".
78	It's been going on for as long as we've known history, even the earliest civilizations have been doing it in Mesopotamia, which is older than Egypt. It wasn't created by the "white devil" we hear about nowadays. I wonder how many Africans would like to go back and stop their ancestors being brought here? Africa has Aids, drought, plague, civil war, ethnic cleansing, and no economy. America seems pretty great, after all!
79	If you want to see your kids, then California is pretty fair to dads. Your kids have a legal right to be in contact with you, unless you're not good enough. If you have a court order, then you need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction of the last court order. Good luck, and you really must fight for this. Your kids need to see their dad, it could hurt them for life, don't wanna leave them to think you're not good enough.
80	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably consult one, but here's my two cents. The full legal text says, "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be deemed to be primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works." The definition of "commercial advantage" is somewhat vague, but if you aren't making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), then you are probably acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
81	It's the beauty of America,you don't have health insurance,why would it change if you were in jail,while everybody else was paying taxes with their hard earned money?Your brother is in jail for a reason,he might not be in this situation if he had made some kind of contribution to society rather than committed crimes.
82	Yes, execution is the only way to get a murderer, he'll never get out of it, he won't hurt anybody else, and it's a good thing that execution is done, because the victim won't have another birthday, won't have another holiday with his family. Some crimes are so disgusting that only execution is the only punishment.
83	It's not illegal to skate, in general, but it's illegal to skate on certain public places. Like when I worked at a retail store, kids skated on our sidewalk and almost killed some elderly customers. That's why it's illegal in some places, because you can run over people who just walk.
84	You can't legislate how someone should feel about somebody else. Racism is bad, but it's protected by the First Amendment. Don't ask why the government doesn't do something about it. They love taking freedom away from people, not protecting them. I'd rather they didn't do anything about it. And, in addition, free speech allows civilised people to keep an eye on the lunatics.
85	If you're the dad: You can always just pay more money that doesn't go into court. Otherwise, you can request an evaluation, which takes time, but child support offices visit the employer and check all the income, then reevaluates the amount per month owed. Some states raise the cost of living every year, some don't. Don't listen to the jerks who say you should be able to support the baby on your own. You didn't get pregnant alone, and you sure shouldn't have to support the baby on your own. Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place. Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant, and he was in college or working minimum wage, but now he has a decent job, and this is a percentage of his income.
86	Unfortunately, I agree. It's difficult to persuade us to send troops to police the world, though I applaud it when we do. The problem is we always get tangled up in the quagmire of international politics and never fully commit to a task, thus we fail and the effort looks like a half-hearted attempt with casualties that we find hard to stomach.
87	No, if you're hooked into the city sewer, you'll have to pay. Check with your city councilmember. They're probably going to negotiate a bill delay when they're first installed, even if it's an oversight by the city. It's a service you have to pay for. They charged me extra sewer when I filled my pool, 6000 gallons, even though it wasn't going down the drain. If they can charge you, they will. Especially if all your neighbors are hooked in, you don't have a choice.
88	Despite what most people believe, most states do not have laws addressing minimum ages for babysitting or minimum ages for which children can be left alone. Unless someone can point out an Illinois law, the answers you get here aren't very helpful. 15 or 16 might sound like reasonable numbers, but that doesn't mean they're correct. I'm not familiar with Illinois law, nor will I invent a number for you.
89	I've seen the cartoons, and they're much less insulting than what official newspapers of some countries, like Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, etc., say about Judaism.
90	I'm not sure this is in the interest of public safety, but if I wanted to blow something up, I wouldn't have talked on the phone to plan it.
91	I'd say it depends on the country they're from, just like everybody in the world has their favorites and dislikes. I think the disliked countries already know who they are and why. If a nation is violent and bad for the world and the government lies and steals and kills innocent people, then it's not popular, nor are its people, because the government is supposed to be representing them. So it's the government that causes this and its people who pay for it.
92	Okay, why don't we make a law that creates a national driver's license, and we need this law because national driver's licenses are safer, and many of the 9-11 terrorists had national driver's licenses that they wouldn't have been able to get under the strict requirements you're putting in your bill. The bill requires citizenship, at least a basic knowledge of the English language, and proof of address. The bill requires that the Department of Homeland Security issue and regulate these licenses, and it's going to be paid for by the driver, so it won't need tax revenues, and it's going to make the states lighter.
93	You're talking about Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader? Well, let's quote him. He once said, "You can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea." He was saying that the idea of freedom from oppression is spreading, no matter what the efforts are to stop it. There's still oppression in the world, and there's still a thirst for freedom from it, so why not? The same basic conditions apply as when Che was alive.
94	In a way, you're making an interesting point, but I'd like to challenge you on a larger scale... Do our laws reflect our morality, or do our morality come from the laws we force others to obey? In their written series of civilization, Will and Ariel Durant pointed out in their first book, "Our Oriental Heritage", that man didn't need or make laws until he thought his neighbors needed them. Think about that for a while, and then consider whether your question is relevant to this. Personally, I believe that faith can and should be a factor in public policy. In a republic such as ours, we agree to obey the majority until a new majority arrives, and every new majority will bring its own set of values.
95	The court must be able to annul the conviction, annul it, make it as if it never existed. The excision of the records is another matter, which calls for more legal work, because even if it were to be granted, there would always be a paper trail, which would always include, for instance, the fact that someone had been arrested in the first place. It is practically impossible, even with a court order, to completely remove all records.
96	Our current drug policy is causing more harm than good, and that's not the case when my neighbor smokes.
97	You're not racist for wanting your family to have equal rights to everyone else, in fact you should have more rights if you were raised and grew up on the land, but unfortunately here in Britain that isn't the case, we actually have less rights and receive less benefits when we become unemployed or ill, whilst immigrants (most of whom are illegal) get much more of our money that we worked for which they take.
98	Your crime is not a discrimination, because you committed it. That was an option, unlike race, sex, etc. I don't think that everyone will reject you, but I usually look at criminal records when hiring, and trust me, there are many more people with records than you think. If someone is a thief or violent, I won't hire them. Companies can refuse to hire for any reason. It might just be that here in Michigan, the economy is so bad, and unemployment is so high, that there aren't enough job openings. But, I would be honest about yourself if they asked.
99	I'm talking about "Hate Crime" laws, which are more severe penalties for crimes committed by people who have a certain opinion, even if they do the same thing. For example, if someone kills another person because they don't like their ethnicity or religious beliefs, they will receive a harsher penalty than another person who kills without hate, simply because he likes killing. The point is, you have a right to your opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts, not just your actions.
100	Sandytoes, asking a court clerk isn't going to help you. They're not allowed to give legal advice. So, instead of giving us more details on your judgment, what it was for, when it was issued, why you say it's expired, where you live, for example, judgments expire in California after 10 years. If your judgment has already expired, it's probably not going to affect your credit rating at all. The only way to get rid of it is to ask the court to expunge it, which is pretty unlikely. But, otherwise, you'll probably just have to put up with it.
101	I'm sure you're right. Did you happen to take photos of all the "fixes"? Sometimes they'll just write a check, unless the clerk isn't too happy to help you. You agreed to the repairs, but you could argue that you were expecting them to be of a similar quality. The fact that they were trying to repair the stand implies that they were insured. Good luck.
102	You need to protect yourself, no matter how much the police are supposed to protect you, when someone breaks into your house at night, you might not have time to call the cops, and even if you did, and they were only five minutes away, you could be killed a hundred times in five minutes. You have a right and an obligation to protect yourself and your family.
103	I think prostitution is overrated, when people wanna have sex and get paid, no. A woman can have sex with a lot of men and not get anything, but when she gets paid a couple of bucks, she's a prostitute, why? Why give it up for free.
104	We should close our borders, we're in a war, we can't look after these people, we don't look after ourselves.
105	There are many forms of abuse mental, physical, neglect, maybe she just doesn't want you around anymore. Maybe it's payback for something you did, and she just can't get over what you did to her. This restraining order might be a peace of mind, "If he's not around me, he can't hurt me anymore." It might give her a place to rest easier, "If I don't see him, I don't have to remember how he lied, cheated, let me down, whatever the case may be."
106	First of all, cops, and no one else, is not angry with you. You decide to be. If you don't want to be angry, then you won't be. It's called victim mentality. You own your emotions, no one else does. Second, as a cop, I can tell you this: I take skaters out of areas where there are no signs for skateboarding, where vandalism is common, or where there are trespass warnings, both the kind you see and the kind you don't, and I don't, and I don't know any cops who intentionally make people angry. It's just the law. You might not be a problem, but the two dozen skaters before you might have been.
107	I agree, in part, what is commonly referred to as racial profiling is justified when used properly. For example, when a car full of black or Hispanic children drives around an upscale neighborhood at 3 a.m., their plates are checked, and it's pretty obvious they don't live there and may be doing something illegal. That, in my opinion, is also a form of profiling. I don't think it's a violation of one's right to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicious. Of course, people will call me racist, etc., but to an open mind, what I just said makes sense and is fair.
108	You're wrong my dear, they're not shut down in India, the ban is only on Maharastra. The government shut them down because they've gotten many complaints from housewives that their husbands were wasting money on these bars and not taking care of their families. Also, many criminal activities took place in these bars. You're probably familiar with the tarannum and telgi cases, where tarannum's monthly income was about 1 lac, and telgi was throwing away nearly 1 lac a day on bar girls. To stop this kind of crime, the government of Maharastra has banned these women's bars.
109	First, the ancient tradition of war, which all nations, including the Lakota, have observed, that the winner of the war takes the country, even if it's a bit of a ruse, and our ancestors only won a handful of battles, the Indian Wars were really a war of wiping, and the nations lost the land because of that. Yes, we have made a difference in this land, there are more trees than there were when Columbus landed here, and we grow most of the food we need to live.
110	Another thing to consider is that some judges can be bought, but they're not really the problem. The philosophy of being a judge is to be neutral, and to listen to the merits of each case separately and as presented. But some judges, especially some new Supreme Court justices, don't feel the need to represent the law, and leave their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one corrupt judge in a million is the zealot who believes it's his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world, and now has the power to do so! Scary stuff.
111	Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. They do not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father.
112	I've been raised by religious people my whole life, they've always said abortion is wrong, murder, and immoral. But I've slowly come to realise that this isn't a fully formed human, so it doesn't make sense. It's someone's body, if they want to abort, let them, don't shame them into having a baby based on religious views. If it matters, I'm Christian, 16. And male.
113	I'm not sure adversarial court system is helpful in finding out the truth. It seems like both parties draw conclusions and try to manipulate a jury with emotional language to persuade them to their side. Moreover, a jury of untrained people, who decide which side is better, seems to be a bad way of finding out the truth. What are the arguments in favor of this system?
114	I'm not trying to be pessimistic, guys, but I don't think we'll have another century. I hate to say it, but I don't think we'll survive.
115	For international CMVs, "greece" refers to a social component at my university where parties are held every weekend, and each party has a specific theme or dress code.* Many people may say that this is alright to some degree, but I think that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon, and ultimately banned. By allowing these parties to continue as a college community, we are furthering segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures, as they are perceived by those who attend in attire. Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific party themes such as blacklight or tropical), we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnic students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.
116	I'm aware it's an "inside joke", but I think it's too common to use it anymore without the audience knowing about it.
117	For example, prostitution stings and drug deals, everything that doesn't involve a victim and doesn't cause any harm or bad intentions. If a cop sees a drug deal, or prostitution, that's one thing. But setting people up for those crimes, it seems to me like the cops are looking for criminals to take in, luring and luring them in, often times, while they are just going about their lives without committing a crime.
118	The title is self explanatory. Vladimir Putin is the head of a disappointed ex-empire, looking to get back its former glory. Russians are traditionally obedient, willing to submit to an autocratic will, and ready to devote themselves to general patriotic ideals (i.e. getting new territories). The guy seems very determined not to comply with Western moral and political values, and seems defiant to the present unanimity of attitudes against his latest moves. It is already quite obvious that Russia's stance on international politics is not a democratically generated one, but exclusively owed to Putin's will. He likes war, confrontation, and seems indifferent to the human costs of his actions. He is determined to make history by any means, just like the celebrity killers do their crimes to get unforgettable, no matter how.
119	I'm sorry if I'm rambling, I'm trying to ensure I hit the 500 word limit. With the exception of the moon, where the dirtbike is an amazing way to rack up coins with flips and crazy airtime, the race car is the better vehicle. On maps like beach and cave, the downforce keeps you down on the big hills, keeping you in the ground. On highway and rollercoaster, forget about it, it's made for those levels. Another big downside of the bike is that it's so flippy, when you get on a hill and lose your momentum, you end up doing a backwards flip, then slip backwards, then can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum, the downforce keeps your front end down, and you can go up any hill. CMV!
120	First of all, we're very greedy. We like to save money where we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8 billion is its budget, and if it was useless, or Congress thought they could get away with it, they would've immediately eliminated it. $8 billion more! They would've gotten a raise! But they didn't. Why? Because they think it's serving some purpose, and I assume it's the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it evolves. You've seen new security measures every year, and while they're annoying, they could potentially save your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min? I can see that many people on reddit disagree with that, and I want to know why so I can form a balanced opinion.
121	I think that a man's first love is his strongest, and every subsequent love is slightly less strong than the first, which is a bit like trying to chase a dragon after taking your first drug. I also believe that after separating from your first love, the veil falls, and your naive beliefs about love are forever gone. This means that you no longer believe in "fairytale" love stories, and start to see how hurtful love can be. Reddit changes my view.
122	I'm thinking that Michael Jackson's death, which I don't think was truly accidental, but that's another CMV, has done something powerful: it has erased, or at least made it impossible to remember, all the bad things he's done in public. I know this isn't an isolated case, and this seems to be the general rule for people who die young, from JFK to Tupac, or John Lennon to Andrew Breitbart. However, I don't understand why humanity keeps deifying the prematurely dead. To see one's bad deeds erased from Earth, with no one to speak of them again, just feels wrong and downplays their earthly acts. Is that right?
123	I fundamentally disagree that every individual has a right to live- if you are willing to put someone else's right to life in jeopardy, then you have demonstrated that you are a net negative impact on society, and that as a whole we would all be better off if you were dead.
124	I'm not talking about my parents here, they're wonderful people. I mean grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (No brothers, sisters, either, I'm an only child.) Most of my parents' argument is that my family won't be around forever, and they'll do anything for me. But, I don't care that they'll do anything for me. It's like having some random almost-stranger say they'll do anything for you. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me, doesn't mean I like him or need to care about him. I don't want them helping me. It's like having some random person who doesn't mean anything to me, and I find him annoying and rude.
125	I understand why they'd have it, but it's not necessary and it's a waste of time for people who want to buy alcohol.
126	I think John Hammond had a great idea, but his human resources department was terrible and underpaid his most important employees. In other words: The Park would have a massive effect on the economy of the Dominican Republic, and any other country where it would have opened its doors. It would have inspired kids all over the world to study science. It would have made our understanding of our planet even better. The possibilities are endless, as long as we didn't have to *spare no expense*
127	Video games should be regarded as drugs, with millions affected because they're not monitored or used in moderation. Especially kids who are becoming addicted and obsessed, they take over their lives and social skills. It's so sad, and I feel so strongly about this because I went through the same thing when I was a kid, and I would do anything to change it, but also grateful, because now I want to make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone else. Let's start a petition, guys!
128	It's useless and I don't think it's the best way to communicate with people, given that we have phones, e-mail, instant messaging, video calling, video chatting. The applications don't have any purpose and aren't really fun. I don't understand why anyone would want to share their feelings or what they're doing and make it known to everybody. I'm not really interested in whether Billy Bob is shopping. It's also a place for online and perhaps real life stalkers, and perhaps future stalkers.
129	If we've learned anything from Iraq, it's that brutal, repressive dictators have their place in the world. If this administration had any brains at all, they'd have a Delta Force huddled under the gallows, with a stepstool, ready to whisk Saddam off to his rightful place in the capital.
130	Superman is quite vulnerable to psionic powers, so Professor X (or Phoenix, or Apocalypse) would have been able to control, trap, or destroy him. Batman doesn't have any abilities, just gadgets, Magneto would have been able to take care of him. Flash? He's running, which is great, but Professor X could probably take care of him as well. In fact, he could probably take them all out without the help of any of the other godlike marvel characters.
131	Yes, it will recover, provided the government stops meddling and taking measures that are merely a 'bailout'. Such things have turned a potential temporary market decline into a massive and horrifying 'Great Depression', including some of the Union's laws that are still crippling our ability to compete. I would like lawmakers to have taken at least SOME relevant history while in high school...
132	I hear that science is playing God all the time. We've surpassed the need for natural selection, and we must control evolution for survival. We've decoded the human genome since 1999, and it's time we manipulate it. Stability in society allows the weak to flourish, not necessarily bad, but damning to our condition. We grow increasingly weaker, thanks to the use of modern medication that suffices our ailments, so that we're not aware of our decline. If God doesn't want us to do this, he's blind. If God wants us to stop, he's inhumane.
133	It's like giving someone a jaguar, but only if they promise to keep it under their roof. It's crap.
134	I'm not sure where you live, but here in Southern California, pizza delivery is till 3 a.m. Plus, I'd rather go to Del Taco than Taco Smell or Taco Hell, or Taco Bell. In the old days, when Taco Fell was just a little bit of a neighborhood joint, we used to go there when we had a craving for tacos and they were five bucks a pop back then. J.J.
135	I see that there's actually no arguments, so I'm just going to clarify a few things for the 'Yes' argument. Even though principals do obtain the right to search (for drug tests, even making the student take off his/her socks if the dog sniffs something on that student), they only retain that right in the event of reported drugs or crime, or in the case that sniffer dogs checks are enacted and the dog smells something. There are restrictions - a principal can't just demand to search a student's possessions on whim - outlined in the Criminal Code, YCJA and Canadian Charter of Rights (as well as parallel US laws). Thus, the right keeps the entire student body safe and away from harmful substances.
136	First of all, bribing a child is defined as saying things like "Now David, if you just put your shoes and coat on, mommy will buy you a toy when we're done at the doctor's office" or "Karen, if you take out the trash, I'll buy you that blouse you wanted" or "It's time to get off the swing, we have to leave...come on honey, if you get off we'll stop at the store and buy the video you wanted" or "Just eat your vegetables and I'll give you extra icecream." These are all things said after bribing your child to do what you want.
137	I've discussed this with my brother many times, and I think the name 'Sublime' isn't describing the band to which it refers. First of all, the word has many different definitions, and none of them describe the band to which it refers. Secondly, the band doesn't seem to be 'elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc.' Thirdly, the band doesn't seem to be 'impressing the mind with a sense of grandeur or power; inspiring awe, veneration, etc.' But what about'supreme or outstanding'? Of course there are different opinions about this, but I think the general consensus is that the band isn't describing the band. I don't hate the band, or their choice of name, actually I like some of their songs. But it's definitely ironic that'sublime isn't sublime'.
138	It's an art, it takes time to master, it's no different than cooking, so start early and you'll be a pro sooner. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll be alcoholics later on, it's still up to their discipline. There are many young alcoholics who never became bartenders, I think what they should include in their training is a better understanding of alcohol and its effects.
139	You're questioning the account of Pontiac Pilate and the testimony of Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus allegedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate to release Jesus so they could torture him. Pilate's wife begged him to release Jesus. Pilate himself was sorrowful and did not sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands. Hippie? I think nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long, except for proper Roman citizens, and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You're not even justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene. And Jesus being married is a false assumption. The whole controversey is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eyewitness accounts claim that He did. What can you say to prove that He didn't?
140	The general opinion is that if dogs have the capacity to remember, it is only for short periods of time. For example, when a dog learns not to defecate in the house by being trained to do so, this is often called conditioning, not memory.
141	I strongly believe that prospective parents should pass a number of psychological tests before they have children, because children need a solid basis to begin a successful life. There are some cases where parents are fools and their kids try to be better than their failed parents, but in most cases they're just a endless line of parasites in our world. We need more intelligent people.
142	The reason marriage should be sacred is that which a man and a woman will bring into the world, a baby. It's the best and most natural way to bring up a healthy and happy baby, and keep the family unit together, man and woman or woman and woman, not going to add more branches to the tree, so it shouldn't be called marriage, call it something else.
143	The amount of money we have is finite, and if it continues to be deflationary, that will probably result in hyperinflation and another depression. If you allow the government to print money that isn't backed by anything, you give them an easy way to steal from the public without anyone knowing about it. And at the end of the day, every nation that ever switched to fiat money has eventually gone bankrupt, because the government couldn't resist the urge to hyperinflate the money supply and make all the money useless. Those who don't know history are condemned to repeat it.
144	Almost 20 debates were created yesterday (12th), and the average for the last weeks has been about 8 or 9 per day. There should be a daily limit, perhaps requiring others to wait until the following day, either through a filtered bucket or something similar, giving people a chance to read current ones. Too many debaters are investing time and effort into the current debates, only to see them fall further down the list, leading to less people reading and responding to them. (I know someone will jump at the chance to call this an open debate where they are 'just another one pushing others down', but I felt this had to be said.)
145	iPhone, of course. Blackberry's just for the old businessmen.
146	I'm an Englishman who loves mostly British music, but I would argue that America has produced more music. Blues and Jazz, which we all know came from America, would have never existed without the Beatles, Rolling Stones or any other big British band before 1977. Don't forget Hip-Hop and Punk, both of which are original American art forms that have had a huge influence on British music since the late seventies and early eighties. America leads in popular music, while the UK follows and adjusts.
147	Obama = good judgment, stability in crisis, curious mind, cares about all people, not just wealthy ones, wants to build a green economy. McCain = old thinking, not curious mind, too ingrained in the system he claims to want to change, stole Obama's good position in this election, running a vile campaign, approving the message.
148	It was a "learning experience" for our country, I think, and if we had not prohibited it then, we would have not known what would have happened. But, I think, by having the prohibition law at the time, we would have seen that it wasn't working, and we would have decided better in the future about such situations.
149	Garry: No, I'd hate that. 1 - You'll never see your friends, family again. 2 - You'll be so old that you won't be able to move much, and you'll be sick. 3 - You won't die even if you're in excruciating pain. (Suffering...) Torture...
150	I'm sure it's good food if you're a big burger fan, but I'm not. It's overrated, my girlfriend said. The fries are great, very fresh, but I wouldn't go there for them. They have these bags of peanuts that you can put in these little paper cups and eat while you're waiting, which is nice. The ambiance is kind of a 1950s diner. If you're a big burger fan, you should go.
151	I've been coming here for about a month and the wheatgrass machine has been broken. I thought, "well, it's a little shop, how long will it take?" But a month later, another customer said it was almost 2 months, and still no wheatgrass. I won't be coming back.
152	I've been here before, but now that Yama Sushi is so popular and large, their sushi has twice the rice it used to, and less fish. Also, their service is terrible, and they recently received a B-health inspection rating for 16 violations, most of which were related to improperly cooked fish. So, go somewhere else or make sure you get good service.
153	I was hoping for a lot more than mediocre but I got less than mediocre. I won't be going back.
154	We were lucky to wait only 20 minutes. Everyone, including my mom, recommends this place. But they gave our oysters to the wrong people, so we didn't get them till after our main dishes arrived. Then we tried to eat them and the muscle was still stuck in the shell. I also ordered the Palace Pan Roast, which was very good, but a bit too rich for my tastes. I'd go back, but only if there wasn't a line.
155	I ordered chicken chow mein and my colleague ordered beef chow fun. First of all, our food took an hour to arrive. Second, our delivery driver dropped our Thai tea, which broke the lids and spilled tea everywhere. Third, he didn't have change! How are you a delivery driver who doesn't have change?! Now, about the food... My colleague said hers was "okay", not anything special. My chicken chow mein was disgusting! The noodles were extremely over cooked, leaving them gooey, soggy, greasy messes of dough. The chicken, I'm not even sure if it was chicken, had so much fat, gristle and muscle it was not edible! And the grease! So much grease! If you're craving quality Chinese food, this is definitely not the place to go!
156	We've been to The Salt Cellar for our anniversary, and the steak they gave him was disgusting. It ruined the whole evening, actually, and not long after that we became vegans, because that experience was so horrible for two people who loved seafood and steaks, but at least we're healthier now. Needless to say, we won't be coming back.
157	I'm really against wearing uniforms, because they don't allow students to show their individuality, they're also very uncomfortable, and in winter they can be very cold, so schools shouldn't make students wear them.
158	I'm just saying Firefox is much better, that's all I'm saying.
159	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab, which I use when I go to www.microsof.com. Just a few reasons why I like Firefox more.
160	I honestly think that Firefox is working better. Tabbed interface, no ActiveX, support for RSS, what's not to like. I think the Internet is still trying to catch up with Firefox.
161	Firefox is much friendlier, remembers passwords more firmly, addons let you personalize it in every way, I love the new tabs, the way they age and remember when you close the browser, Weatherfox, gestures, there's even a tab that displays pages in IE format when something's not working, which is uncommon, and only SAP in my work, and the way you place logos on the toolbar is great. Much friendlier, much more efficient browser, and not just because I don't want to support Microsoft, but because I simply do not care, a great product is a great product.
162	From a design point of view, Firefox is clearly the winner of the Pretty Browser wars. There are so many nice skins for Firefox, and when you add up the amount of Toolbar and UI personalisation that Firefox allows, it's a clear winner. And since I assume most people who argue about browser superiority are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly interface like all IE 7 versions?
163	I'm a Firefox fanatic and defender, but this site breaks it.
164	I'm not sure, 'cause it depends on who she killed and how it happened. If it was self-defense, then no, but if she just lost her mind and killed someone, then yes, I would tell the cops.
165	I'd have him turn himself in, I'd try to convince him first to do it, but if he didn't do it, then I'd have to assume responsibility for him. And I don't wanna have the guilt of knowing that I didn't turn in the murder, if he really loved me.
166	I'd make a vow to stand by them, in sickness and in health, they might be mad, but she'd be my wife.
167	No, I wouldn't have turned them in, if I really loved someone, especially if it was an accident. But if he killed someone just because he wanted to kill someone, then it might be a bit different, because I wouldn't want him to lose his mind and kill me too.
168	Books improve grammar and spelling, plus they're more creative than TV. With TV, everything's premade for you, while with books you can imagine the characters' looks and the setting with your own bit of creativity in it. Plus, you can take books everywhere without disturbing anyone.
169	I don't think India will lead the world in the near future with this cream layer quota system. Yes, India has potential, but corruption, this quota system, which isn't helpful to anyone, and the main reason for brain drain aren't helping India at all.
170	It's better to be without a father than a bad one. It's a proven fact that girls look for someone to be their other half, someone who's the same as their father. Having a bad father, for a girl, would mean having a bad boyfriend too.
171	I'd rather be without a father than have a bad father who does nothing for his kids. Most kids look up to their dads, but if he's not a good father, then he's no good for the kids.
172	Raffles was chief of farquhar, and since he was chief and had more rights than farquhar, he should have been the founder of Singapore. But farquhar did not act responsibly and let slaves, cockfighting, and murders go on all over Singapore. Raffles was unhappy about Singapore's poor development.
173	Pornography is a dangerous addiction for some people, which can lead to guilt and lust, and which distorts the true nature of sex. Pornography promotes the idea that sex is only pleasure, but it is also about love and affection. Pornography inspires a lot of crimes which sometimes abuse the rights and virginity of many people.
174	You're a Christian or something, if you're not, then who's to stop you? For the record, that's wrong, but it's impossible to argue against that if you and the other guy don't have the same beliefs.
175	Why do you assume, when you accuse God of wasting time, that He must function within the limits of time?
176	Until FF is preinstalled on PCs, IE will still be dominant.
177	If firefox's the best, why do all the sites have to be IE-compatible?
178	I've been using Internet Explorer from the start, but recently I've begun using Firefox. There are some obvious differences, like the fact that Firefox has tabs, which isn't available in Internet Explorer, but there are no other significant advantages to using Firefox. Also, IE7 includes the tabs feature, as well as add-ons that provide different functionalities, so I think IE is superior to Firefox.
179	For some websites, such as Novanet, FireFox doesn't allow pop-up windows. To install these, you need Internet Explorer.
180	I'm using firefox, but there aren't any websites that work well with firefox, so until it's more common, I'll use IE.
181	First, it's a fun activity during the school day, and we get to have fun while exercising, losing the weight we're gaining, not all of it, but... Second, obesity is a serious problem within the United States, so this would definitely help! Third, people can have a moment when they eat school lunches, and lose some of that fat while they're sweating!
182	The schools should have physical education, because the school I'm at only has PE in the middle school, not the high school, and we're a mixed school. Because we don't have physical education in our high school, many students aren't fit, and they have bad habits like smoking and drinking, and they showed that during their first year of sports, they had a hard time doing simple pre-season training, and they said, "If we had physical education, it would have been easier, and it would have been simpler to train." Their lack of physical education made it difficult for them to do just 3 push-ups!
183	I'm sorry, one more thing: interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER didn't answer my explanation of why I find adoption a less desirable alternative to abort... Interesting how people just ignore what they can't or won't argue against. If you want to respond to someone's argument on here, click "view all" first, which will give you a history of their arguments and may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.
184	If nothing else, it's the last bastion of freedom to resist the government.
185	No one mentions that unwanted pregnancies are the cause of over 99% of all abortions, so preventing them is the same as stopping abortions. Wouldn't that please both parties?
186	I think we should be more concerned with protecting the rights of much more conscious animals, like fully developed primates, when we aren't concerned with the feelings of unborn children.
187	The decision whether or not to abort should be made solely by the woman, at any stage of pregnancy. Why do most anti-abortion activists favor capital punishment? Jon Jax, 71
188	Just a reminder to creationists, use the "convinced me" link correctly. You should click it when the argument convinces you that creationism is real. Some of you seem to click everything on the right side, which won't help you win the debate.
189	Evolution is a scientific truth, and all the objections I've seen, which I'll reply to later, have nothing to do with science. They're religious claims. Let's get a better understanding of what science is. Science is known by the scientific method, which deals only with nature. Creationism is trying to sneak the supernatural into the scientific method, which is called pseudoscience.
190	I'm confused. 99% of what you're saying is in favor of evolution, against creationism. At most, you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would argue with you on that), and that there might be a halfway point between faith and science where evolution and creationism can coexist (a lot of liberal theologians and even agnostics wouldn't have a problem with that idea)
191	Not really, but in your line of argument, it's like believing that a riddle can be solved by waving a magic wand.
192	Idiots who say pornography degrades women are wrong. First of all, they're getting paid well, secondly they choose to do it, thirdly some girls really love what they do, fourthly without sex and porn, you wouldn't have been born.
193	I've noticed that whenever someone starts talking about "Porn is ebil and degrading", they focus solely on women, as if there weren't any porn actors. (What, men don't count?) Porn is just a form of amusement, no more, no less. Any argument against that is just "feminist" bullshit.
194	Porn isn't bad, if you don't do it behind your partner's back. It's just degrading to the women who want to show off.
195	I think it's better to serve the common good than pursue personal interests, because most people care more about themselves than others. Serving yourself before serving others won't do much good in the long run. I believe that "what goes around comes around", so when you do something for others before serving yourself, not only will it help them, but it will also help you.
196	This is very unfortunate, as uniforms are also cost-effective.
197	I'm sure the school uniform is a great idea, I agree that many students don't like it, but there are many benefits. As other people have said, kids don't have to worry about what to wear at first, which is a major problem for teenagers.
198	Children have two role models; mother and father. Their behavior and personality are affected by their children, so if there's a problem in that relationship, that can affect the child's personality, too.
199	It's better to have a dad who's bad, because I think my dad is pretty good, and I'm doing great. It's just, knowing that you have a dad, and not knowing what he looks like, or what his job is, it would be a topic of insecurity in my life. So, in my opinion, it's better to just know he's there.
200	I'd rather have a bad father than be without a father, because at least I'd have peace of mind knowing who my father was, rather than spend my whole life trying to find out.
201	To a thirsty person, a drop of water is worth more than a sack of gold.
202	Yes, it's creating serious environmental problems, and when people realise that it's also harming us humans, they won't be using plastic anymore!
203	Large water extraction firms are stealing water from our lakes, which in turn is killing habitats of animals that love water, such as platypus.
204	There's only lyrics on the other side, doesn't have anything to do with water!
205	He's no high fives, just sixes. He's a godfather's godfather. He taught a German Shepherd how to bark in Spanish once.
206	I'm convinced books are superior, I'm convinced I'm able to fly, that's right.
207	I'm thinking TV's great, 'cause it's quicker and some people can't read.
208	Jesus loves plastic water bottles, and you're not gonna be able to argue with that.
209	If homosexuality was natural, then there would only be 6 people on earth, meaning none of the people making these sarcastic remakes would be around, and I wouldn't be around.
210	After 2012, India's growth will be more rapid than any other country on earth.
211	India's English is better than the original English man, British and American English have many grammatical errors, so who is better, Indians or Americans? "The truth is stranger than fiction."
212	Lord Ram, Krishna, Vishvamitr, etc., giving a broad idea that India will become Vishvaguru in the future, should not be forgotten.
213	Yes, India, along with China, is on the path to becoming the world's biggest economic power, thanks to its rapidly growing population and growing economy.
214	Agnostic is the real answer, people can believe in God or not, but they'll never know. Personally, I believe in no God, but I'll never know for sure.
215	Atheism; before I believe in magic, I need at least some proof.
216	I'm an atheist because I think we're all living on one life, which should be enjoyed and preserved for all generations to come.
217	Christianity is probably the most repulsive ideal that poisons man's mind, its usage, motives, and fictions are clearly immoral. (http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/religion.html) (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/whynotchristian.html) (http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/ 3956.Christopher_Hitchens)
218	Is it my fault you think Christianity condones slavery?
219	Sometimes a child may benefit from being spanked, but only to the point where it's painful and shouldn't be used repeatedly.
220	I'm of the opinion that some parents should hit their children, but only when necessary, because sometimes it's the only way some children learn right and listen.
221	Disciplinary action should not be a spanking, parents have many other options before resorting to a spanking, it's better to discuss with them what they did wrong and resolve the issue properly.
222	It's bad for children's development to be spanked. We always tell our kids not to hurt anybody else, but we spank our kids. It's not worth it.
223	Yes, I'll definitely report him to the police, because he committed a murder, and that's a sin. Maybe if he's arrested, he'll feel guilt for what he did, and try not to do it again. And also, how can I believe a murderer? He can lie to me, and in the future, he might kill me for somebody else, so just telling me that he's innocent doesn't make him clean and innocent.
224	I'm going to ask you one thing, if you had a really bad fight with someone and broke your hand or arm, would you cut it off just so you could remember that experience? If you're actually sane, you would say no, and if you say yes, you need to see a physiatrist!
225	No, when they condemned the cannibalism of Africa, did they think about the right to life of those people? No, not at all. Why should abortion be any different?
226	I'm not sure how people rationalize killing, it doesn't make sense, like the situation in America, where is killing legal?
227	I say let's make it easy for gays to get divorced, split assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make it illegal to get married; that makes it too easy to walk away from a relationship and encourages roommates to be "couples" to help each other out with benefits. Civil unions are gone, gay marriage is in!
228	If heterosexuals can marry, do whatever they like, why can't gays?
229	One of the reasons is that now there are many more people who agree with us.
230	To help the common good, you must first understand what your common good is. You must know when you're a better person, so that you can share your good with others. You can't just presume that you're a good person, if you haven't done anything to prove it.
231	I'm of the opinion that personal interest is more important than anyone else's, but I'm not sure. If someone in your family needs help, you'll do anything for that family member. I'm of the opinion that if someone in your family needs help, you'll do it no matter what. If someone in your family needs help, you'll help that family member no matter what. If someone in your family needs help, you'll help that family member no matter what. If someone in your family needs help, you'll help that family member no matter what.
232	I'm going to have to choose my own personal goal, I've got my targets, and I want to reach them before I start helping others.
233	I believe that people should have the right to die with dignity, and that there is obviously a need for safety measures and procedures to protect innocent people from predators, but if someone is terminally ill and doesn't think that their quality of life is good enough to continue, they should be allowed to request a medicinal product that will end their lives. I've seen relatives die from cancer; no one deserves to be forced to go through this process unwillingly. Those who wish to should receive all the support they need; those who choose to die early should be given the means to do so.
234	It would be better to select our candidates by giving us the facts about how they voted on all issues during their time in government, so you can see if they are voting the way you want them to, or whether they aren't. And how many times they were absenteeism. We are their bosses, to some degree, and we put them in office. The thing that annoys me most is the wonderful raises they give themselves. If there is something that should be on the ballot, it's whether or not they should get a raise. After all, where else can you go to work and decide, "I'm going to give myself a raise." But it's just a bunch of propaganda and mudslinging.
235	The Internet is still such a new phenomenon, that laws and policies are being created as we speak. But unless you're pretty certain they'll be okay with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. It's also the right thing to do ethically. A lot of people create 'banners' for other people to put on their websites as a link to theirs. But some people don't mind if you put the URL. Bottom line is, when in doubt, check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you permission prior to your adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a question of asking.
236	I don't think it's a problem if it happened outside the workplace and after the working day.
237	I completely agree with you, with DNA it's easier to prove guilt nowadays, so when it's proven that someone is 100% guilty, hang 'em, especially paedophiles, they're the lowest of the low. As for the answer from the government, maybe it hasn't prevented any more murders, but at least it's less of a burden on taxpayers to keep scum like that in jail.
238	Personally, I'm not fond of it, but since my husband and I run our own electrical company that provides 24 hour service, we get many calls on our cell phones at night, since we have our land line diverted to our cell phones when we're not in the office. However, we always keep our phones on silent or vibrating in public so we don't disturb anyone around us.
239	I'm not sure why not, since people in Europe can drink at age 16, Germany, and Mexico had an age of 18, and now it's 21. I guess the reason it's 21, is because Americans are too stupid to behave properly. Why is the drinking age in other countries lower, and they have fewer accidents or other problems?
240	I'd rather see more treatment facilities than less, and the ones that are good are too costly for the common druggie to afford, so they stop and go back to jail.
241	The Supreme Court has ruled that race cannot be the sole criterion for admission, but it can be used as part of the decision process. Diversity is a new way of life for many people, even though no company will admit to quotas on the labour market.
242	Yes, you're allowed to get a ticket for blocking a street in Los Angeles County. It's actually against the law to block any street, whether it's yours or not. If you block a street, and an emergency arises, how will people who park there get their cars moved if you're gone and you didn't leave the keys in the car? Also, what if an emergency personnel need access to your backyard, etc.
243	I'm of the opinion that African Americans shouldn't say that either, because it's still a word that separates races. If two black kids are playing with a white kid, and they say the n-word, the white kid, just wanting to be nice, will want to say the n-word, too, because he'll always feel like an outsider if he can't greet them the way they greet each other. On the flip side, I'm one of the few African Americans who feel that way, and I agree: why does this really matter so much to whites? You can't have that word, you have all the other words you need to use, plus you run the world, is it really so bad that black people have this?
244	I think the government should let churches perform marriages for whomever they see fit, and let the government record those marriages or civil unions, and give equal rights to all. There are plural marriages, but that's another issue, and a different issue. In my opinion, marriage or civil union is a support for individuals, especially when they have children. Some of the most monogamous couples I've ever known are gay, and they're great parents, too.
245	I am amazed at the fact that people can be against capital punishment and for abortion. Respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the liberal "don't kill convicted murderers, but kill all the babies you want."
246	I think people who have kids are selfish and only think of themselves..think about the kids..I wouldn't wanna have a mom who got sick or a dad in a wheelchair..think about it..so my answer is no..give kids a home where they have a mom who bakes cookies for them or a dad who plays ball with them..so no, I don't believe that "everyone" has the right to have kids.
247	You're not getting the point, are you? If you're from California, you can bet the cops can seize your car and it won't take three times to get it right.
248	I agree that reducing abortions in the U.S. would be beneficial, and birth control should be used in all cases where people have sex.
249	It wouldn't make much difference if you owned a piece of land. Most or all islands are under the responsibility of a nearby country or are called protectorates, so even though you owned that "island block", you couldn't do what you want to. There's a chance you could have local laws like those in towns, but don't forget who's going to enforce them.
250	If your society systematically humiliates or punishes a specific race, then there's no distinction, because such discrimination (jobs, schools, neighborhoods) will increase criminality, simply because there are fewer and fewer alternatives. If white Anglo-Saxon protestants had been systematically humiliated for generations, they'd be pretty much indistinguishable from criminals.
251	It's your fault you got bad advice from an Internet chat room, question and answer site. You're not hiring a lawyer on Yahoo Answers. You're hiring a lawyer in your state, if you need legal advice. If you do something extremely stupid as a result of this site, you were extremely stupid before that.
252	I've always been annoyed with age-based prices, like movie tickets. A seat is a seat, why should people between 12 and 64 pay more for the same seat? And what's the point of "senior" discounts? I mean, all of us have a "fixed income", right? And what's the point of "kids eat free"? Why can't I eat for free? I mean, Geez, kids don't pay anything. Let me eat every 5th meal for free and I'll come back to your restaurant.
253	I agree. I don't smoke marijuana, but think legalization would save money. First, the government spends a lot of money on trying to stop people from smoking marijuana, with advertising and all. Second, the government has to spend tax money on building new prisons, because so many people are arrested for possession. Third, the government could tax it as they tax tobacco and alcohol, so they could potentially make millions, maybe even more. Fourth, police could spend more time helping people, rather than trying to bust people for smoking a little marijuana every now and then.
254	If you confront her openly, she'll despise you for exposing her bad behavior. If you anonymously send the General Manager proof of her behavior, he may be inclined not to believe the accusations. However, you must have all your facts completely established. Getting people to write their opinion will not be accepted as fact. You need absolute proof, and to show her intent to cheat and lie. She can always claim these were innocent mistakes or things done without her knowledge. Remember, you will need verifiable dates, names, events, and most importantly, a consistent story from each person who was a witness to any of these events. You do not want to come across as a whining malcontent. If you show indisputable evidence, the General Manager will have to act.
255	I've been to Dar a few weeks ago and I can't really answer your individual questions, but I can give you some answers to your general questions based on what I saw in Dar.
256	I often ask myself the same thing. The sheep are behind him because the administration has succeeded in terrorizing his supporters. They use the crayon chart to tell people about the danger, but they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on September 11th affect how we live. The crayon chart is really only needed by state and local governments, as it advises them if they need more resources at a given time. (Public servants) So Bush could have told people that he's a child of Satan, and people would still vote for him because they hate the other political party so much.
257	It's not going to happen. People are free to make their own decisions in life. It's a shame it has such big consequences, but you sound stupid.
258	It's not your lease that you give your apartment key to somebody, especially for the reasons you say, and it's not a lease, and you're not doing anything wrong. It sounds to me like your landlord is a bit too nosey, and you're right.
259	That's the most ridiculous gun law passed to date, and you're right, that it hasn't been used in a violent crime. I don't know where it happened, but so far, there's only been one fatality from a 50A Desert Eagle, and I believe that was from a 50A Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles, and the expensive ammo, which isn't available at every gun store, makes it very impractical for any criminal. When California passed the law, Barrett actually ended the warrants on the LAPD M99, and then came out with the CA legal.416 rifle. Then all the black powder shooters started to complain, so California made an exception for.50cal blackpowder rifles! (which are easier for criminals to get).
260	It's a shame you can't believe the people who are supposed to protect you, but when you think about it, everyone is racist in their own way. Some people don't even realize that. Racism is terrible, but we should all look at each other like the same thing. People are like crayons. Different shapes, sizes, colors, but we all have to live in the same box.
261	If you want to ask forgiveness directly from God, through Jesus Christ, then you should be a Christian, not a Catholic. Catholics pray to saints, idols, Virgin Mary, etc., while Christians pray to God only through Jesus Christ. These are only some of the many differences between Christians and Catholics. Choose wisely.... If I'm wrong, please correct me. May God Bless you.
262	The United States and UK are among the world's wealthiest nations, which makes them attractive targets for terrorists. Furthermore, they are more likely to be attacked for their commitment to the Global War on Terror, and terrorists are more likely to attempt to terrorize their own peoples. As a result, the United States and UK have been more vigorous than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activity in other nations.
263	I'm not comfortable with the idea of burning the flag, but the freedom that it should symbolize should allow one to do so, if they wish. After all, it's just a piece of cloth.
264	The United Nations would collapse without US support, and all our funding and troops under their control.
265	The First Amendment protects, among other things, the right of individuals to associate with whomever they wish. If two men wish to, they can do so freely, but the day you say that marriage to another man is compulsory, that's the day I'm leaving the United States. No one will force me to get married to another man.
266	I'm thinking this is a gimmick, why would big supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans, etc., when they're not decent enough to pay farmers in this country a fair price on their products, and when we're all sucked into the idea of a moneymaker's carbon footprint, how do you justify flying food around the world for the poor? I don't think the elite will go without fair trade or organic, even if it's contaminated with GM.
267	I pause here for a bitter laugh...that's an excellent question! Look, isn't this a poor woman, an immigrant, not a wealthy white woman, a woman whose family isn't being torn apart by an agonizing decision they're not in agreement on? This isn't an election year? The Shrub is in enough trouble with the public without this situation getting the same press that Schiavo's case got? In any case, while I agree wholeheartedly with your characterization of the "Culture of Life" folks as a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites, I find myself, even if I don't entirely agree, grateful that this woman was allowed to die without being at the center of a terrible storm of public controversy played out among people who don't even know her. Cold comfort, but it's all I have some days. I'm very grateful she had family around her, shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her mother.
268	I think that these kinds of intrusions into private lives are deeply problematic, and should not happen. If they are published, we should refrain from listening to or reading them.
269	Almost all the problems we've seen in government corruption are caused by the fact that we allow them to be bought by their personal desires and selfishness. If we don't allow them to be wealthy, we can stop most of the corruption. If a wealthy businessman decides to go into politics, he should give up his money and all other non-essential things, so that he can prove that he's not in it for the money, but for the job. I know it's unlikely that this will be implemented, don't use it as an argument.
270	I'm from a family that was, and still is, heavily involved in Northern Ireland's Troubles. While I wasn't explicitly told that IRA and Sinn Fein were bad people, I got a very bad impression of them. IRA blew up Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to expand into Northern Ireland, and that they wanted to be part of Northern Ireland was blatantly false. The Republic of Ireland has existed since World War I, so moving there wasn't out of the question for IRA or sympathisers.
271	Incumbents have an advantage over challengers, which is that they can give political favors immediately, better funding, gerrymandering, and name recognition. This would cause more turnover, which is good, because: * It would reduce the corrupting influence of non quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last * High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists * When a majority of representatives are freshmen, they will be more idealistic and less jaded, and this will help them serve the public good I'm not sure how to implement it, but maybe just decrease incumbent's vote tally by 15% or so. My point is that something like that *should* be done, not that it's likely under present circumstances.
272	I'll start by saying that I am a man myself, and I consider myself an egalitarian, humanitarian, and socialist. I don't like the feminist movement, because from what I've seen of their views, they're just a bunch of old white male supremacists. But, from what I've seen, the MRA is the same. I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (like, for example, men being seen as all pedophiles, women being able to get away with more socially and legally, and media valuing males less than females), but, like the feminist movement, there aren't enough issues here to make people completely enraged activists. But, that's just my opinion, feel free to change it!
273	I think that introducing a way to reduce misinformed votes is important. The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, but would ensure that the voter had read the bill before they voted. I believe that this could be done by trials in which sample populations who have not yet read the bill were given a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.
274	You're familiar with the "systems" in cars, which make bass boom from miles away, and vibrations rattle the floors. The music is usually terrible techno or hip-hop, which isn't much help to the driver. From a safety point of view, these systems are clearly a distraction, which could obscure an emergency vehicle siren or a passing car horn. From a quality of life point of view, they're simply noise pollution, and a sign of pure irresponsibility when a driver refuses to turn them off at night.
275	I'm aware of the good in religion, like teaching morals, encouraging people to help others, etc. I'm also aware that many conflicts are caused by or revolve around religion, like World War II, Islamic Conquests, Ottoman wars in Europe, and Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Another reason is that other religions try to demonize one another. "Your religion is wrong and bad while mine is right and good! Let's fight about it!" There are also people and animals that are sacrificed for religion, people ignore science and rely on "faith", religious places (whether it be a church or temple, whatever) are always asking for money, Censorship of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs, etc. Not to mention people are voted into office often because of their religion. Suicide bombers
276	To clarify, I do not believe the world's climate is stable and unchanging, I simply do not think it is nearly as dramatic as the media makes it out to be. I do not believe there has been any significant warming in recent years, and I think the whole issue of climate change is a bunch of green charlatans pushed by politicians who can no longer deny it and maintain their credibility. I used to be very interested in the scientific side of things, but I haven't been for a while, although I will correspond with a friend of mine who is similarly inclined and has a good understanding of the science. I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia, where I live, but I can't comment on the US media. It would be political suicide for any politician to consider that the issue of climate change "denialists" is being relentlessly pursued by pretty much everyone. Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism about climate change is ignored is appalling.
277	I've been reading a post today about a supposed malaria vaccine, and I think, while it's great that this discovery will end the suffering of infected people, and prevent the possibility of putting more people through this illness, it will, in the end, result in an increase in the world population. Every new development in health prevention or life extension contributes to the steady and inevitable increase in people on this planet. The end result is that people will increasingly die at a lower rate while new people are increasingly born at a higher rate. The earth cannot sustain this. Is there another angle that could help me enjoy these medical discoveries more? All I see is a bleak future fast approaching as more people live longer.
278	It's pretty much the same as the title says, I played it and beat it and I really don't understand why people love it so much. The gameplay is pretty standard, the story is pretty good, but most of the time you're just walking around, watching cutscenes, or doing combat or stealth, which are both done better in other games. Every time I ask people why they love TLOU, they always give me the same answer: "It's an amazing story, and it's very emotional." Which is definitely true, but what makes it better than other games? And how does a great story make up for a bland gameplay?
279	All of these methods result in long and painful deaths, which is probably equal to mustard gas burns, assuming that mustard gas is only used in battle and doesn't reach other areas, such as civilian areas.
280	The establishment of Israel is often justified by the need to protect Jewish people all over the world. But why should Israel be established on a historically significant but highly dangerous spot, on the basis of a historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a part of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy Jews, and work towards accepting Jewish visitors to their Holy Land? I am aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, annexing a part of Germany is arguably more morally justified than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a part of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been a vastly superior option. CMV.
281	For easier rebuttal and responding: 1. Putting a lot of value on sex, seeing it as something that only one person can do, can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 2. It's an essential part of a relationship, so lowering the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc. I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the value of sex in society. CMV!
282	It's a lottery, the draw will decide the winner, for sure, but the better team doesn't always win. And shootouts are thrilling, as any other sport can produce, but they're a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the World Cup level.
283	I was born just in time to completely miss the Pokemon craze. I see how it's a cultural touchstone for the generation born after me, but I've never had any contact with cards or games in any way. I've seen some clips from the TV shows, and they're really stupid. The games, from what I can see, combine the excitement of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding. CMV that Pokemon games are for kids, and there's no point in trying them for the first time as an adult.
284	I don't think the current situation in North Korea is funny, but when I scroll through the comments on reddit, every time North Korea is mentioned, there's a pretty good chance there'll be a joke about it. The jokes obscure the reality of the situation, and while a tiny percentage of people might actually believe what they're saying, most people think the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea are something we should be aware of and possibly take action to better. I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they're just jokes, but in my opinion, they're just as insensitive and inappropriate as jokes about the Holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights. And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang
285	I have some gay friends who are angry about the LGBT acronym and the fact that trans people are "uninvited" to join the gay movement, which they think belittles and muddles serious political issues today. I understand that trans people want societal acceptance and want their voices heard, but using the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to achieve that.
286	I've been to or seen photos of family graduations from kindergarten, sixth, eighth, and my daughter's high school graduation. I'm not talking about a simple gathering, I'm talking full on graduation ceremonies, with caps, gowns, speeches, hours long, etc. I think celebrating all these smaller milestones in the same way as the end goal completely diminishes the feeling of crossing the stage for students when they get their diplomas or degrees.
287	The religion of Judaism claims that there were 600,000 people on Mount Sinai, and the Bible says that this is the number that left Egypt. Since there were 600,000 people, then we can safely assume that there were more than a million people gathered. Now, even in ancient Israel, convincing millions of people that all their ancestors were on Mount Sinai and God talked to them is a crazy task. It would be EXTREMELY difficult to fake something like that and convince a whole nation. Therefore, I believe that the National Revelation proof makes Judaism the most plausible religion. Islam and Christianity are based on the same proof, but they use a different leap of faith, so they're more unlikely to be believed.
288	This is an example of a situation where an intoxicated person is at a gathering. Someone sees him or her and makes an attempt to engage in sex, if the person agrees, then the person waives their right to sue for rape. This situation assumes the second party did not tamper with the first's drink or, in any way, use the situation to their own advantage maliciously (e.g. getting the first drunk for the purpose of sexual intercourse). This was prompted by a discussion with my girlfriend last night, and I want to know the arguments on her side, as well as the arguments on my side.
289	I'm changing my mind. Coors Light tastes like beer-flavored pisswater. Labatts tastes like a pond where 80-year-old Canucks had sex. Budweiser is for people who don't know what beer is. Yuengling is mass produced and actually pretty good. It's not the best beer, mind you, but it's good. A lot of beer snobs are going to parties. These guys aren't easy to please, but they *will* settle for Yuengling. It's just good enough to not offend, and just bad enough to please the unwashed plebs.
290	In terms of financial comfort, $70,000 is enough to cover your living expenses, transportation, and other costs, even if you don't live in cities. Why would anyone want more than $70,000?
291	If anything we create is artificial, then we ourselves are artificial intelligence, correct? The creator is the "real" creature, while the creation is an imitation of itself. That means that if anything we create is artificial, we are also artificial intelligence, if we were created. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Is it possible to love an artificial creature we created with artificial intelligence? If not, then how can God love me or you?
292	I think it depends on how the wealthy got their money. Some wealthy people got their money honestly, and should be left alone. However, a lot of wealthy people got a significant part of their money dishonestly...by hiring "illegal alien" workers who work for maybe $1-2 an hour, instead of hiring a legal worker who they would have to pay minimum wage to (Wal-Mart has been found guilty of this many times over the last years, especially in hiring janitorial staff), cheating on their tax returns, other accounting fiascos (just look at Enron), etc. Any wealthy person who got their money dishonestly, I would say steal it all and give it to the poor, because that's probably who they took it from.
293	First, let's make three basic ideas about God: A. God is perfect B. God sees everything C. God can do whatever he likes.
294	It's definitely more intense, because legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body, and rowing for long periods of time can be very difficult on the upper body and core. This argument, however, assumes that the person is trained equally for each form of event. Not everyone is a natural runner, and may have insane upper body strength, and vice versa. So it depends on the person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I would have to say rowing.
295	I'm sure environmentalism is good, but lately I think it's a cult. They obviously have good views and do help the planet, but the thing that bothers me is "global warming". I think there's strong evidence that earth is warming naturally, due to the sun, not because of CO2. These radical environmentalists are literally trying to form a kind of dictatorship, where so many aspects of life are strictly controlled to stop climate change. Anyone that questions them is a heretic, and even with overwhelming scientific evidence against global warming, they persist. I'm tired of overpriced "green" products, carbon credits, and attempts by them to waste billions of dollars and slow down America's economy. They have gone from the point of actually focusing on real environmental issues to just feeding the public lies and creating new, pretend problems to waste our time. Discuss.
296	Bill O'Reilly has an opinion, and sometimes it's well founded, sometimes it's not. Keith Olberman has an opinion, and sometimes it's not. All of them can use rational argumentation, and sometimes they'll resort to more base forms of persuasion, but that's okay, because the main audience is happy to just wink at the ruse.
297	I agree that a good education is essential for success, because it gives you a solid foundation for learning. If you have a good foundation for math, science and languages, then you can succeed in life, because mastering those subjects makes it possible for you to calculate, invent and communicate.
298	A recession isn't always bad, an optimistic view of this recession is that all the corporate fat is being eliminated and trimmed, leaving only the best and most adequate companies. Short term job loss and price increases are certainly unpleasant, but they're only temporary. The US has gotten out of worse before (late 70's early 80's situation, and the Great Depression, to name just a few).
299	After World War II, car, oil, rubber, and construction firms caused this crisis by not maintaining, increasing public transport, but instead, as scientists suggested, developing solar power. They chased the big bucks, ruining public transport, building highways, freeways, shopping centres, relying on fossil fuels while polluting the environment. It's just a case of chickens coming home to roost,
300	Maybe not all teenagers; there's a good case for new drivers. Perhaps restrictions on the number of passengers should apply for the first 6 months after passing the test, and for provisional licensees, although I think there's already a restriction on that. Personally, I would also suggest limiting the distance new drivers can travel on their own or with them as sole driver. This would be very difficult to monitor, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year caused by rookie drivers on their first motorway journey.
301	Monarchies are a burden on the economy if they are parliamentary monarchies, because they have no original role - ruling. There are many examples: British, Danish, Japanese monarchies, which have no real power, no policy influence and live only on the backs of taxpayers. For instance, the British royal family costs the UK 40 million pounds a year.
302	You can say you know someone completely, even if you've known each other for a little less than a lifetime, but every single day, minute, and second of your life, you learn something about that person that would surprise you to know. For example: crime, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, facial expressions, job endings, etc. In the end, everyone has something in their soul that is eventually revealed to the world that they don't know or didn't know before. Because of that, you can never really know what makes someone tick.
303	"There is no such thing as nothing." To say that, or even think about it, implies that there is something that is "nothing." But, paradoxically, to assert that there is no such thing as nothing is to assert, in fact, that there is no such thing as nothing.
304	I don't think the Phelps clan has a right to free speech by choosing to attend a funeral for one man. It's almost an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. Had they done it somewhere else and expressed their opinions about all military personnel or gays, they would have been fine. But choosing to attend a funeral for one man and posting signs that read "Semper Fi Gay" or "Thank God for dead soldiers" is an emotional attack that does not deserve to be protected by the First Amendment.
305	In 2002, Ann wrote an article, trying to be funny, she wrote: "Trying golf is like the Special Olympics." That article caused quite a bit of controversy, and I think that was one of the meanest things she'd ever said. What do you think?
306	Uh, let me see, if the government wanted him dead, they would've killed him a long time ago when he was actually inventing things that might have been related to weapons. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley, that would've been a lot more conspiracy theorist probability.
307	I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. I had heard bad reviews about this place but the chicken tacos sounded really good so I decided to live wild and give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they were soft tacos on Tuesday which meant I could get two for $.99 each! I was expecting them to be small but they had enough meat to fill one and I ate both. The iced tea was fresh and the restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a salsa bar with four salsas, traditional vegetables, etc. I could have taken pictures to show how much meat was in the tacos but I just ate them.
308	It's a nice place to relax, nice terrace, wide range of food, but cash only. Last time I was there, the ATM didn't work either, although I don't really like using my card at an ATM that I don't know. They should have at least debit or Apple Pay. Other than that, you order at the counter and get your food at your table. I'd come back for a coffee break.
309	It's hard to argue that you can't leave Cheesecake Factory without a full stomach and a satisfactory meal, but it's probably not very inventive.
310	I've been coming here for a latte the first time and it was great. I was glad to support a local business and the girls working were nice. The second time I came in, I got a cup of hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the woman scrubbing her bottom through her yoga pants as she went back to make it. She washed her hands before she started but I was already over it. I didn't want to eat anything but politely waited. They certainly put a lot of time and effort into the parfait. It was a pretty fancy yogurt option after the long wait... Except for the 18inch red curly hair wrapped in the top. Health code standards have gone out the window in the valley.
311	The ambiance was nice, very 60's Italian. I had gnocchi pesto, which was very bland. No basil, no olive oil, no parmesan. I'm not sure how that could be. The pine nuts were just thrown on top, which seemed lazy. Salad was brown. House Italian tasted like stale parm. Portions were lame for the price (usually you can count on a $14 gnocchi to be pretty hearty - this one would be a'small plate' at most Italian joints). We spent 60 on two people and didn't even get to see "the most romantic patio in Cleveland." I'll be back in the summer to check out "the most romantic patio in Cleveland." I'm hoping another dish will be worth it.
312	The waiter was great, very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal. The food was just okay.
313	I'm a fan of this place even though it's not consistent. The sandwiches are good, the veggie burger is one of the better ones I've tried, and they give generous portions. We often order from here using Wheel Deliver and everything is always marked correctly and the orders are always correct (which isn't the case with other places that serve large lunches). I will continue to visit this delicious place.
314	I'm of the opinion that we shouldn't be wearing school clothes, because they're so strange and the good reason is that there's no more bullying and also that they're stupid and gay.
315	Is that even being argued? The only advantage of IE is that Windows comes preinstalled with it, but from what I hear, that's also going to be removed.
316	Mozilla Firefox is good for everything, there's also add-ons that let you use the Internet Explorer engine inside the Firefox shell, there are lots of add-ons, and themes are nice. All the innovations of E 7.0 were already in Firefox years ago.
317	I'd never have turned him in if my husband had killed someone, because I know he must have had a good reason for it. Everyone makes mistakes in this world, and this would be a bad choice for him. I love him, and I think that love should be with your partner no matter what. I don't want my husband in jail.
318	No, I'd not turn in my wife, because when you marry, you make a promise to be there for each other no matter what, and I'd do anything to help her, but, don't misunderstand me, if my wife was caught, I wouldn't go with her, because, most likely, I would have a family to care for, and I wouldn't leave them for anything.
319	I'd probably not turn in my spouse, because of the love that holds us together, but on the flip side, I would have turned in my own husband if it was just plain murder.
320	I'm not completely against TV, but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people. http://www.echoworld.com/B05/B0510/B0510TVBad.htm
321	We're aware India is awash in corruption, every man doesn't have time to assist others, his only goal is to make money any way he can. Manners and civilization are deteriorating every day.
322	India will never lead the world if no one can understand what they're saying with their ridiculous accent!
323	I'm not sure, even as an Indian citizen, that GDP of India will increase in the next five years, because of so much unemployment. They don't even have enough money to feed all the poor, how can we imagine them leading the world?
324	It's really bad not to have a male role model when you grow up, but I think being fatherless is better than having a bad father. The reason is, you don't wanna look up to a man who's doing nothing in life, but setting bad examples, and who knows, you'll grow up following him. So being fatherless is better, because from the first day you start depending on yourself, without needing your father to be there, and there'll always be other people helping you to live.
325	Personally, I know how it feels to be without a father. My dad was a terrible man. I've seen him once in 13 years, and I haven't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me, because I don't know him, and I'm never disappointed. So, it's better to be without a father than have a bad father.
326	I'd rather be without a father than a bad father, a bad father who tire of telling me what to do but has no life, I'd rather be raised by a mother who cares, loves, and actually lives and works every day to make money so we can eat.
327	By setting up Chinese and Malays schools, he restored the region's cultural heritage and did much for the people, while Farquhar was only trying to take control.
328	Porn is bad because you're lusting, and it's worse when you're married, because you look at someone in a preverted way, and that's not your wife or husband, and that's cheating. But we've all been lusting before, right? I don't judge you, but it's bad, and you should stop.
329	The argument is founded on convincing evidence. There's very little evidence for creationism, while there's a lot of evidence for evolutionism.
330	I thought there was a reason for everything, I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving, Actually, I'm pretty sure it looks and behaves the same for a thousand years. How does an animal acquire a trait that it wasn't born with, does it just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? And you've proved my point, "species have certain characteristics and properties", I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change And by the way, I just wanted to ask, what insects are you talking about?
331	It's been there since then, and it's installed on most computers. Internet Explorer is universal! Firefox is still downloading or installing.
332	In my opinion, physical education should be obligatory in schools, because it gives children a bit of exercise, and if it was obligatory in all schools, there would be much less obesity. Of course, health education should also be part of it, so that children learn how to eat properly, so they won't be obese any more.
333	Yes, yes, yes, and most definitely yes. Insufficient physical education is the reason your aunt or uncle is in the hospital. Insufficient physical education is the reason millions of people are overweight. Insufficient physical education is the reason you can't sleep well at night. Insufficient physical education is the reason you don't have great sex with your girlfriends.
334	While Raffles was away, Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and drew merchants to the island.
335	He invited immigrants from Malacca to come and trade, and set up an office on St. John's island to inform traders passing by about Singapore's colony.
336	Raffles's not interested in the people, he's not thinking about them at all. Even though he discovered Malaysia, Singapore, he didn't help develop it in the least. Why should he be called its founder? Farquhar had developed Singapore, and all his ideas had contributed to its development.
337	This shows that the people of Singapore regarded Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles.
338	Farquar had sorted out a lot of problems, including the plague of rats and centipedes, which took him a couple of days to completely eradicate, while Raffles didn't do anything at all.
339	"If the child is going to be a DaVinci, then there is a simple counterargument: "If the woman who gets pregnant is going to be a legend in the world, but she can't reach it because she has to care for a child she isn't ready for."
340	Life has existed for billions of years, and any failure to replicate it in a laboratory is purely due to the fact that researchers haven't spent those same billions of years trying.
341	Is there a brain scan of the first man, or an average organ measurement, hair pattern, facial features, heartbeat records? When you talk about that, how do you explain the various racial differences in today's people? I'm married to a japanese woman, why do we look so different? Was there really a Garden of Eden in Asia, and an African Garden, and an... What do you really believe?
342	I'm not sure why this matters so much. We're here, whoop-de-doo, so go on with your life! If you believe in creationism, great, good for you. If you believe in evolutionism, same. I understand the purpose of debate is to persuade the opponent to your side, but I just don't see why there's a need to debate this at all.
343	I'm going to have to disagree with phro and say that peppered moths are showing signs of evolution. The information might not be enough, but evolution is happening.
344	I'd say that before the theory of evolution, belief in God was sensible, but now it seems that the argument "who created the creator?" holds. A omniscience, omnipotence, loving, merciful, personal God is the most complicated creature I can think of, so a complicated life cannot be explained by a complicated creator.
345	I'm also curious that, as of this moment, there are 7 votes "Porn is bad", but no one is willing or able to explain why.
346	Everyone has sex, so it's not wrong to make money off it. It's genius.
347	Listen, porn isn't bad, because kids don't get that kind of demonstration at school because of parents. Porn teaches, but it sets good examples.
348	If I could do both, it would be amazing, but if I had to pick, I'd rather help people in any way I could. Even small things like being a friend or helping them to get what they need to live.
349	I like the idea of school uniforms, first of all, they make students look nice and tidy, secondly, we can see who's studying at what school, or who's studying at the same school as us, and lastly, it's convenient because we don't need to spend a lot of time choosing clothes for school.
350	I'd rather have a bad father than no father, because fathers are the best things that could happen to you. At least he's there when you need someone. You can count on him for anything. And I think bad fathers are like that because they love their kids and want their son or daughter to be the best they can be.
351	It's better to have a bad father than no father, maybe it's not so bad, except that you live with the idea that you don't have one, or you live with the doubt that you might have one.
352	It's better to have a bad father than no father, because you can count on your father, who will always be there for you, no matter what. If you don't have a father, then you don't really know what's good and bad. If you don't have a father, then you have no one to count on or complain to.
353	I'd rather have a bad father than no father at all, because one day you're going to need his help. (Maybe not help, but at least you tried). I know I have a bad father, and sometimes he makes me mad, but other times he does the stupidest things, and I laugh. I know I don't have the dad I want, but I still love him.
354	It seems to me that it's better to have a bad father than not have one at all. If someone isn't good at something, there's always a chance they'll be good at it one day. If you're fatherless, there's no chance of having a good father. So it's better to have a bad father.
355	Estimates vary, but the global sales of bottled water are between $50 and $100 billion annually, and the market is growing at an astonishing 7% annually.
356	TV, because TV brings you live news about books that you can't find, and it's educational.
357	You can install the "Foxtel Go" application on your iPad, so you can watch TV wherever you like.
358	When you're not bothered by anything, you can just sit on the couch, munch on potato chips, burgers, candy, and watch TV.
359	Water bottles are a secure source of water and guarantee safety
360	Nevertheless, many government programs regularly distribute bottled water for different reasons. It is much easier to distribute small bottles of water than to distribute large quantities of water in bulk, and it is also much more likely that large containers of water will be contaminated than single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.
361	It's true that bottled water is a waste, but the bottles can be reused!
362	If bottled water did not exist, people would drink more sweetened liquids because they would be the only drinks that could be carried! People would be fat!
363	It doesn't seem natural to put two people together, even though the world is changing and there are new ideas. Marriage is before God, and these are words taken from the Bible, and obviously God doesn't like it. Isn't that ironic?
364	For those who are trying to follow the argument and rebuttal threads, I think the argument of chasbas, which I rebutted on Feb 7, 2007 at 07:09, has been deleted. I would like the argument and rebuttal system on this site to be better.
365	Guys and girls were created for a reason, and that reason isn't to get along with the same sex, it's to get along with the opposite sex. Opposites attract, everywhere, be it magnets, electricity, atoms, or people. Besides, it doesn't work with two men, so there are female and male reproductive systems, which only work together, so there's only one way to reproduce, between man and woman.
366	I'm not for it. As I said before, if the state didn't give tax breaks or any kind of favoritism for marriage, I wouldn't be bothered. My church doesn't support it either. It bothers me that people who say they're Christians support it, let them, even allow gay clergy.
367	It's totally unnatural, because all sexual creatures have a partner of the opposite sex.
368	Of course it can, but right now I can't think of any leading nation that has had major internal conflict, it's not working. A country must have time and resources to worry about other countries, not just its own.
369	India and China may redefine the concept of a 3rd world country, because in the future, both will be 1st and 3rd world countries.
370	We're not exactly sure if there's a higher force or not, but Christianity isn't it, first of all because it's not a belief that all Christians hold, it's a fragmented one, like a highway with all sorts of side roads. Ask a question about religion, many people will find a way to adjust their religion to their own beliefs.
371	That's the biggest problem I have with Christianity: why is it about faith? There are terrible people who believe, but there are great people who do great things in the world and are atheists. Is it right to punish them for not knowing what reality is? I am an atheist and a good person. The idea that a difference in beliefs can determine a person's destiny is preposterous. It's madness!
372	This debate is a false choice, a choice between Christianity and atheism. Shouldn't it be "theism, atheism, or no"?
373	Sometimes it's just the child who needs to behave this way, all those Nos, the stop, the don't, just don't work.
374	I agree, because they need to realize they're wrong and there will be consequences to their actions, so they can learn not to do it again.
375	Atheism is based on science, faith is based on soul. Atheism needs to be fed constantly, faith isn't. Even though I'm a religious person, I think atheism is worth hearing, because everyone is independent and everyone must have their own opinion.
376	Parents should not resort to spanking as a method of disciplining their children, because it only irritates them and makes them mad, rather than showing them what they've done wrong.
377	No, because hitting your baby can make your child mentally damaged, and that can lead to them believing that hitting their kids is okay.
378	I'd report them, whether it was self-defense or an act of rage, because if it was self-defense, they'd probably get away with it, but if it was an act of rage, I wouldn't be able to live with that person for the rest of my life, my conscience would eat me, and I wouldn't be able to live knowing that there is a family mourning because of what my husband did.
379	I'd report my spouse to the police if they told me they killed someone, whether it was accident or deliberate. For example, if your spouse killed yours, wouldn't you want to know who did it? I would, I wouldn't rest until I knew. Sometimes in life you have to worry about someone other than yourself.
380	I'm going to argue in favor of "yes," but in my opinion, that depends entirely on whether or not my husband kills someone in self-defense. If he kills someone without any reason, I'd rather he kills the person than my husband dies, but if he kills someone without any reason, I'd probably turn him in, because love is strong, but it can also be blind. I wouldn't want to be married to a murderer, because what if one day he decides to kill me?
381	In fact, the government tells women what they're allowed to do with their bodies. Suicide is against the law. If someone is caught attempting to cut himself into pieces, they can be sent to a psychiatric hospital. So the government is effectively restricting what a woman can do with her body.
382	No matter what the woman's circumstances are, she got pregnant! When rape happens, why is it the poor defenseless child who has no choice and ends up dead? The child is innocent, yes, it wasn't the mother's fault, but why is she more important than the child? Women have become selfish in their bodies, they think they have a right to be pregnant and then get rid of the child if they feel like it and make a mistake.
383	It's an indirect murder when a woman decides to abort a child she just killed, a life that might have been a great help in society.
384	While it's true that physical education should remain at the high school, it shouldn't be compulsory (especially not for the entire four years of high school). Perhaps just make it an optional class, and make it compulsory for one year, rather than the entire year. At the elementary level, it should be compulsory, because children tend to gain and lose weight in strange ways. That's all.
385	It's costly, embarrassing for some, and unfair for AP students who don't participate in varsity sports, because they can skip this class.
386	It's a personal choice, it's a personal conviction, so who are we to say that gay couples don't have the same rights as heterosexual couples?
387	I'm an agnostic, so my religion doesn't conflict with this issue. I'm an avid supporter of gay rights. Marriage is supposed to be between two people who love and care about each other. Some straight couples marry just to have kids, so is that okay? What's the point of marriage if two people marry just to have kids? As we live in a developing society, more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is okay.
388	You can feel pride in helping others for the greater good, but you need to have the means to do so, and the first step is to have a personal goal. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but you need a personal goal before you can have a societal goal. For some people, though, their personal goals can be advancing the common good.
389	The founding fathers were involved in colonial governments before they were involved in rebellions. In Virginia, our House of Burgesses paid every widow and orphan a certain amount of money every year, plus they used tax money to build houses for the common good, plus they had courts to protect their rights. When we had a revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation. We weren't opposed to taxation at all. You're taking a pretty narrow view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society, plus you seem to be basing your argument on parts of our founding documents that don't actually exist.
390	It sounds like you're in a lot of trouble. CASA is Community Alternate Systems Agency, which is staffed by registered nurses who decide whether or not you're eligible for Medicade. If you bring your baby into the doctor or the emergency room, and anyone sees any signs of abuse (bruises, etc.), they are required by law to report it. Or, they might just be trying to figure out if you're eligible for Medicade. As bureaucrats, they tend to get their noses in everyone's business.
391	Officially, they're supposed to maintain an "orderly market", which means they must buy and sell to prevent the market from changing abruptly and dramatically, but it's also true that they make full use of opportunities to buy and sell when they can make money. It's an unpleasant trade-off, I don't like it, but that's what's happening.
392	Yes, both women have their own issues, which is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is in court for you, your new wife is in court for her husband, which has nothing to do with you. The only conflict would be if you both had the same lawyer, which obviously wouldn't work. You need someone who's looking out for your interests, and she needs someone who's looking out for hers, unless you're cheating on your ex with your new girlfriend, which would probably result in a divorce court case.
393	The leak about Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA operative threatened her life and perhaps our country's safety when it was revealed.
394	I agree that women should have the right to choose, and that there are many children who need to be placed in foster care and have a very difficult life. I'm pro-choice. But, I also think that if it's illegal, many women will die from having abortions in "holes in the wall" places that aren't clean or in conditions that are almost torture. I'd never do that, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. Ask people if they want to pay higher taxes to cover the cost of the government caring for abandoned children left by mothers who don't want or can't look after them.
395	Ethically, it's not right to invade the privacy of an innocent person, and there are many lawsuits against photographers and publications. But we have a right to know what the government is doing, because it's with our money. Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us. Anyone who says the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock. The 4th Amendment has been effectively negated by SSN, gun records, increased search & seizure to look for "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are forced to cooperate with bureaucrats and hand over the little privacy we still have.
396	This guy's got a point. I don't know the specifics about the yahoo connection, but I'm sure the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Incidents may have dropped in recent years, but beatings and torture are still commonplace there. America simply chooses to ignore this, because we're more interested in maintaining good trade relations with China, even though much of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We should really wake up and see the truth.
397	If you're strong enough to go through the worst times of your life again, then I say you should demand compensation. Money won't change the fact that you've been through something worse than anger and bitterness, but if you can get something positive out of the crap you've gone through, then why not? I hope everything works out for you. You're worthy, your family is worthy.
398	I'm sure it won't work. Most lawyers won't work for nothing unless there's a compelling social reason to do so (like if you're protesting discrimination, etc). You might be able to get someone to take the case for free, meaning they'll get a percentage of whatever settlement is reached. But that's only going to work if you have a great case, and your case is likely to settle for a large amount. Otherwise, be prepared to pay. I went to law school and spent years training, and hundreds of thousands of dollars; I don't generally give work away for free unless there's a really good reason. And no, "I don't want to pay" isn't a good reason.
399	I'm not trying to bash Bush here, but one thing I noticed was that he doesn't seem to be able to speak well in public. You'd think he'd have the best speech writers money can buy, but I don't think he uses them. I almost think he just wings it, but who knows. I don't see a problem with speech writers, to be honest, if your a president of a company, or of a nation, what you say will effect many people. Hiring someone who is skilled in speeches and public policy is not only rational, but almost the only choice to properly convey the message you want everyone to hear. Debates are a good place to start, since even though they have official "answers" to expected questions, they do have to be on their toes a bit more than when they give an address.
400	First of all, the Constitution does not guarantee the right to "pursuit or pursuit of happiness", that expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. Secondly, I do not think that the enforcement of laws on prostitution is a matter of very much time and energy, given the other crimes. Thirdly, do you accept that morality plays any role in criminal law? For example, the laws on the age of consent: why is consensual sex illegal for a person of 15, but not for a person of 16, and so on.
401	The distinction is not so clear, as it is about dolphins and porpoises, not about lions and bats. The reason one is legal and the other isn't, is that the legislation says that one is legal and the other isn't.
402	In fact, you're wrong. The system of justice that America has developed and that we have practiced is the best that humanity has ever devised, and it's not perfect, and it's imperfect, but it's human, and it's still the best we've ever devised, no matter what the media might say and promote. Because people are doing better and want better, we will become better for ourselves and our kids.
403	You might be able to. Here's what I would do. First, gather all your receipts. If you don't have the receipts, then you're screwed and should just go. However, there's a chance your old pharmacy has your prescriptions on file and can give you a copy of your purchase. Second, I don't think the pharmacy will want to reimburse you, but your insurance company might. Copy all the receipts, write a letter and fill out your insurance company's claim form. Send it all in and cross your fingers. Good luck!
404	You shouldn't expect a real answer from anyone here, because no one here knows all the details about your case, except maybe you. It'd take a lawyer a long time to prepare a defense, and no one here can help you much if he doesn't know all the details. This is one of those cases where Y!A isn't really helpful to you.
405	You've been warned, so don't plead for pity because of "just a little marijuana." It wasn't just about marijuana, he's committed other crimes, just didn't get caught. We Californians are safer without him on the street.
406	It is true, if it is his baby, then he has every right to demand that the child bear his surname, and if I were him, I would not sign the birth certificate if there were other names. But why assume that he's gone? He didn't say that in the question, just that they were separated.
407	You're saying you signed a contract knowing you wouldn't be able to keep it? The answer is, "yes." The property manager can put restrictions on the lease, depending on the exact wording of the lease. The word "loaded" could mean you could keep an unloaded firearm with a clip or speed loader nearby, but it'd be difficult to prove.
408	Unfortunately, no, you cannot reopen a case like that, not without new evidence, and even then, it's unlikely that your lawyer will be of much help. A very important lesson to be learned here is that, as you were so young at the time, your body was still changing, and with Firestone's record, you should have included a clause in the settlement, or not settled at all, that future consequences of the accident could be claimed.
409	It's fine if you do it honestly, but if you do it to shout "I've got a bomb!" in public places and then rationalize it by saying that you were speaking your new language, which was your sole purpose in creating a new language in the first place, then it won't help you and you'll be convicted of "making terrorist threats."
410	I think that should be ruled out as hearsay and thrown out at once. It's inadmissible evidence. First, he's a simple target for coercion. He was coerced into confessing. Second, there's no proof he said the words that were said, and the language and thought process are too difficult for this defendant. He's not smart enough to think of problems in logical progressions.
411	Since she signed for it, she can't get off the loan. The only way she can get off it is by disputing the signature on the promissory note, otherwise she's stuck. And no, he won't get away with it either. They can take his tax return to pay on it. She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.
412	I guess feminists still follow Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer black babies.
413	It's Hollywood, I've been to court many times, just to watch, not testify, just to see, and I've never seen them do this. They just ask you to raise your right arm and swear, "I swear this is true, or something like that." That's all.
414	You're probably not reporting the information correctly, aren't you? If you're parking your car on your employer's private property, the law in your state may well give them the right to impose that policy. No matter what you think about this policy, unless you're in a union, I don't know of any state or federal laws that would protect you if you were fired because of this policy. You have two choices: stop smoking or smoke outside.
415	It's still a violation of the right of way, and the driver with the green light is the one who is driving, whether he's a fool or not. Here in New England, and I'm sure everywhere, there are many drivers who spend miles with their lights on, and I wait until they actually turn to go, because when they do, they lose their right of way on the street they were on.
416	Doctor, please be very careful. I am a writer and ex police officer. These people will surgically remove their boots from your own. Send a formal certified letter and a form for permission to use their content to the original publisher of the material. If they don't reply, get the information from another source. Protect yourself, my friend. Their lawyers will eat your lunch and leave you alone with Twinkies. Also, a disclaimer on your site is still a good idea. Tina
417	It is difficult to think through all the issues individually, because there are so many. For example, if you think that abortion is better than having a child, then you might be mistaken.
418	I'm completely for this. People say it's barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that a pervert who rapped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live? We'd put down a dangerous dog, why not do the same for some of the scum who live here? The justice system in Britain is a mess right now, and too many people are getting away with all sorts of things and there's a need to do something about it.
419	You've admitted fault here, and I'm betting you've admitted fault there, too. Read what you've written, and you'll see that you have no argument. He didn't write a ticket for not stopping at a stop sign. He wrote a ticket for "failure to yield to oncoming traffic at a stop sign." Huge difference, if you've been hit by oncoming traffic, it's obvious you didn't yield to their right of way! Best bet is to plead "no contest," accept the verdict of the court, and not admit guilt, so you don't look foolish arguing about an open and closed case, and save face at the same time.
420	I'm trying to teach my kids that "you treat people the way you want them to treat you, not the way they are currently treating you." Two negatives equal one positive in math, so torture is completely unacceptable. Those who think it's okay are completely barbarians, and they'll change their minds when they're tortured.
421	I'm a law-abiding citizen, and guess what? I have a permit to carry a firearm for my own protection, and I was able to get that permit because I wasn't a thief, and I earned that right.
422	Emergency petitions for psychiatric evaluations are not arrests.. nor are they available for employers to review.. The American Disabilities Act prevents this.. and gives you a basis for a lawsuit if it is used against you.. You do need to inform your employer of your condition.. If he fires you... you will file a claim with the ADA.. chances are they will deny your claim if you did not make them aware of your condition prior to employment.. After the ADA reviews this... you will be given a "right to sue" letter... whether the ADA finds validity in your claim or not... you still have to go through this... After the ADA process is over... you can get a lawyer involved... he will argue that you did not make your employer aware of your condition prior to employment because they would not have hired you in the first place.. Many lawyers work pro bono and have a field day with employers like these.. bottom line... mental illnesses such as bipolar are a disabilty... Furthermore... you may also be eligible for Social Security... so you don't have to put up with narrowminded employers.
423	Well, it would have been nice if you had used spell check first... Your question is difficult to read for those of us who actually speak and write English... So my answer is, which marriage are you speaking about? I'm on my third marriage, and at my age, it would be foolish to act like a virgin this late in my life... I know others who are in their fifth marriage; do you think they should wait, too? Just exactly how much more holy are you than the rest of us? In my previous two marriages, my ex-partners walked out on me because of cheating, and I wasn't to blame... So, we should study this aspect more, don't we?
424	I think it's okay to break the law if it's going to cause harm or death to somebody. Also, if the law is fundamentally discriminatory, I think it's okay to break it for at least one person so they can argue against it at the Supreme Court, like when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.
425	I'm not sure I'll ever be able to say this publicly, hence the post, but I really enjoyed Battlefield Earth. The acting isn't great, but it's a decent sci-fi film with plenty of action. It gives a nice idea of post-war America, with some nice references to Fort Hood, Knoxville, and a few other famous cities. The learning machine allows humans to become intelligent, Travolta getting his comeuppance at the end. I gotta say, if it's on, I tend to watch it. To give a quick overview, my 5 favorite movies of all time (in no particular order) Shawshank, Godfather, Inside Man, Animal House, Goodfellas.
426	First of all, here's the definitions from the Oxford Dictionaries: Pornography: "Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings." Explicit: "Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion." I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because they were "pornographic" when the text is not sexy or titilating, just descriptive. Some don't even include real descriptions of sex at all. I cannot find a citation right now (on mobile), but I have heard many people say that pornographic is to be defined by the community Without an understanding of the difference between pornographic and sexually explicit, community members are not at liberty to define either term.
427	I'm not sure this is relevant to Canada, but I don't think it matters who wins or what party they belong to. I think that regardless of whether it's Liberal, Conservative, or NDP (read: parties that could realistically win pretty much everything), some good things will happen, more bad things will happen, there's a 25% chance of major scandal, and corruption will definitely happen. And then there's the fact that every incumbent cancels out what their predecessors put in place to put their own mark on things and this just continues in a cycle. This is how I see the situation without my own political beliefs, so I don't take into account, for instance, that I'm in favor of subways and party X isn't.
428	Instruments have such extreme limitations compared to normal composition software that I think they're obsolete in today's music world. They're imperfect, and you can't control the frequency of the sounds you make as well. People spend years learning how to make one sound, instead of all the possible ones. When you play an instrument, you're just a drone, an atomaton, playing someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier compared to being a president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.
429	I've been debating this for months, and I can't decide which is the right moral path.. I always thought that killing an animal for food, and not fun, is morally correct, because there animals don't understand death, like people do, and they will live a wonderful life in the wild, whether or not I kill them.. And as for producing animals for food, I also think that's alright, provided that they are treated well and fairly. This is why I'm a vegan right now, because I hate how the main meat sources we have come from horrible people who treat animals with unnecessary cruelty, or at least it seems like they do..
430	The reasons are: -My planned degree is in the scientific field, and a bachelor's isn't much of a prestige in that field, whereas a PhD is usually the goal. -It's a normal event in life for people who are serious about their future, and there's no need to celebrate something that's expected and not surprising. -I don't have much emotional connection to the college I'm finishing. -The college isn't prestigious/well known for the area I'm studying, so the lessons weren't as rigorous as they could have been, and therefore attending a ceremony that signifies I didn't put in as much effort into my studies and finishing my studies is, quite frankly, embarrassing.
431	After a marriage ends, unless a prenup is signed, one partner usually receives alimony from the other. I think this is wrong, and selfish of the people who receive it. If someone gets divorced, they don't want to see that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to pay them money they've worked for. It's stupid, I think. If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to make their living on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options. Of course, if they have kids together, the partner should send the person child support to help take care of the children, but money just to take care of the adult they didn't want to be with anymore? hell no. They can get a job. CMV!
432	I've heard many people say that Nirvana were just another band, when they were really great. I've heard many great bands like Pearl Jam, and to a lesser extent Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, but I don't believe the spiel that Nirvana were just another band.
433	I'm scrolling through Reddit and there are sections of comments that I don't understand. People talking about spaghetti, quoting movies about transformers? Karma is flowing freely, and nobody has any original thoughts. It's a waste of time. Can't you have your own thoughts, or is every concept you understand dependent on a career actor mouthing lines that have been approved by a committee of movie company executives? I'm sick. Only the first person to say "Frankly, my dear, I don't care" gets an upvote, and no one else after that.
434	It makes sense in an academic context- some people gain from characteristics they are born with, due to historical and current discrimination- but it seems like whenever it's used outside sociological theory, it's just an excuse to dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with.
435	I'm influenced by the IAmA entry from the guy who proudly kills fellow humans in the name of "saving" animals. But really? How are hunters more morally and ecologically irresponsible than poachers? Hunters are responsible for the extinction of all animal species that we can remember, and in the past. They threaten animals for profit. Anti-hunting initiatives are hypocrisy in themselves, because firstly they don't improve the existence of humanity. And secondly, they don't stop the extinction of various species of animals caused by humans.
436	The realism in games like Call of Duty and Battlefield is similar to cop and soldier training simulators designed to teach people how to shoot people in a kneejerk way.
437	I know this sounds terrible, but I don't think that donating rice to a third world country is a good idea. While it might seem like a good idea at first, reducing starvation, in the end it just temporarily hides a problem. When a third world country is supplied with rice that it can distribute to its people, any form of farming or other food production in that country suffers. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in that country, his livelihood will be destroyed by rice that is freely available to the population. If any kind of donation is made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize farmers of the third world, which would allow lower food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these countries.
438	I think people forget about the most important thing, intelligence. You can be paralyzed and in a wheelchair, and still succeed. Stephen Hawking is an example. He has almost nothing going for him but his brain.
439	I'd say no one should be a permanent member and that the five countries with the biggest influence on the world (defined by economic, political, military, and human rights records) would lose their seat. As for the other seats, they would be filled as they currently are...Vote power I think it's overpowered, for proof of this look towards North Korea...I think 2/3 majority is enough to take action on an issue I understand that this is 2 parts, but they go together so I thought it should be ok to put them in 1 CMV
440	I'm not talking about depression due to a terminal illness, but specifically clinical depression leading to suicidal tendencies for years, decades. I don't see it as a choice, but an instinctive reaction, some people manage, others don't. Also, my philosophy about life's worth is undoubtedly affecting my stance. I don't think that anyone has an objective, inalienable value and that refusing to let someone end their lives is promoting their suffering for the sake of society's discomfort at the thought of death. However, short-term episodes of suicidality should be treated, but when they become chronic, pain takes precedence over pleasure. For example, someone who has suffered from suicidal tendencies for years, but has resisted because of guilt from family, is literally tortured into accepting life rather than being allowed to sigh peacefully.
441	I'm not trying to offend, I really hope I don't sound like I'm speaking ill of the dead. Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has and here is why: She ruined both of her marriages because she slept with other married men. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is that she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement), but she should in no way be considered a role model to women. Any woman that exhibits this kind of behavior today would be considered to be an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone? She wasn't classy. She wasn't elegant. At best, she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day.
442	I was raised by my patriotic Irish upbringing to despise Margaret Thatcher. She refused Bobby Sands and other IRA members political prisoners status during a hunger strike in 1980s, and they died shortly thereafter. During her time as prime minister, Britain's old industries were decaying and poverty was spreading across Wales, Scotland and Northern England, where I know people who hate her. Recently, to my surprise, I met a man in London who thought she was a great leader. She's also called "Iron Lady". I can't stand this woman and how anyone can.
443	I saw this movie when it came out years ago and almost all of my friends love it. They usually say things like: artistic cinematography, wonderful soundtrack, great acting, etc. Now I don't hate it, but most of my friends said it was one of the best movies of the year. I thought Gosling's character was very bland, and although he was supposed to be some kind of sociopath, I felt like he was just a pretty face with violent tendencies. The other actors were good, especially Cranston, but nothing award winning. The soundtrack was really good, but it didn't do much to elevate the movie above being one of the top 10 movies of the year. All in all, I thought it was a pretty boring movie with an exciting opening sequence.
444	I'm strongly opposed to HFCS because, simply put, it kills people. While I understand it's cheaper, it's not better. Here are some of the reasons: 1.) All artificial sugars cause obesity or even cancer. 2.) The FDA doesn't regulate the factories that make HFCS. Tests have shown that some of the shipments of HFCS have mercury in them. 3.) HFCS and cane sugar aren't biochemically identical, and our bodies don't process them the way they do with cane sugar. 4.) The corn industry is very corrupt and has caused local farmers to go out of business, which hurts the US economy.
445	This happens all the time, online and in real life. Someone says something and someone says "that's racist," which is their trump card that they feel immediately discredits the other person's entire argument. Let's please ignore inflammatory racist statements. We all know they are bad. This "that's racist" trump card is played virtually any time race is a part of the discussion. A recent example is the Mark Cuban situation (let's please not debate that ITT). If you're not aware, Mark Cuban, speaking of the Donald Sterling NBA fiasco said that if a black male in a hoodie was walking down the street he would switch sides, and if that side had a white male with neck tattoos, he would switch back. Cue outrage. People respond with "that's racist." I don't believe that "that's racist" inherently discredits an argument or observation. CMV.
446	Bleach is a good anime/manga, but when it comes to anime quality, it's not even close to the same. FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and wasn't entirely based on manga. The limited number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam. Bleach is now in the 160's, if I remember correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to. The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like it's dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things moving strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42), and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.
447	Although eBay is only a means of connecting suppliers and consumers, it is better from an economic point of view. With no fixed prices, eBay's market is very much like an internet free market, where consumers pay what they want and sellers supply goods at what they want to sell. In other words, this is a self-targeting market which works perfectly, with the exception of delivery problems. Amazon, on the other hand, used to use consumer price targeting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to buy certain types of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targeting. Now they set prices based on what the product suppliers set them at, which may not be working at optimum efficiency.
448	Final Fantasy is superior to kingdom hearts because of its better graphics and story. Kingdom hearts has some nice features, but there are some small black creatures called heartless and grey empty bodies called "nobody" and the biggest problem is that you do it all with a key. Also, some Final Fantasy games are played in a turn, which is nice. The Final Fantasy Trilogy has been released since the NES, and I've played the first one since its release, so I can honestly say that not only is it more popular than most games, but it's also better rated than Kingdom Hearts.
449	Arguments against the existence of God are, in fact, useless. There are logical arguments against the existence of God, but they can be disproven by more logic. This can be referred to David Hume's "Matter of Facts," which says that there are facts which can be presented, and which cannot be disproven. There are no concrete arguments which can be presented to prove or disprove his existence, thus making it useless to debate about whether or not he exists. It's all about faith.
450	Global warming is a global problem, hence the global part. America prides itself on being a country that does not hesitate to enter another country to "rescue" and "liberate" it from evil forces, even if the rest of the world does not always agree. If America is really going to help the world, it needs to take a stand against global warming. As one of the world's biggest producers of CO2, the least Bush can do is promise to reduce his catastrophic contribution to the damage caused to the planet every day.
451	There are many reasons against torture, but the most important is that it doesn't work. All these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasies straight out of "24." That doesn't happen in real life. Another reason: aren't we supposed to be the good guys? How are we supposed to maintain our supposed moral superiority when we degrade ourselves by stooping to the level of our enemies? If someone wants to argue that we need to reach the level of our enemies in order to be effective in the war on terror, shouldn't we round up all German Americans during World War II and burn them in ovens? Shouldn't we reach the level of Germans in order to be effective? I don't think the United States can seriously dictate to other countries when it doesn't obey its own Constitution.
452	Two reasons: - Let all children be wanted. Knowing that you're unwanted but the parent is prohibited from having an abortion can be emotionally devastating for some. - Anyone who doesn't want their child so badly that they want it terminated is not a good parent. If they can't look after their child, they will probably abuse, malnutrition or neglect it. Here's my solution: once you find out you're pregnant (unintentionally), immediately look for an adopter, and if that doesn't work, have an abortion.
453	If we don't intervene, the wealthy will get richer, the poorer, and that's not good for society. Without health care, without political and legal representation, and blood will be spilled during a revolution, which will usually end with a dictatorship. This doesn't mean taxing people 20%, it means making it a social goal to help the poor and invest in people.
454	I've just watched the original debate in the House of Commons, on TV, about Tony Blair's legacy, and I've been wondering about that. I think that the additional benefits of having all 7 Member States on board would have mitigated much of the catastrophe of the engagement and subsequent occupation had the steps been taken to secure a binding resolution.
455	Engineers have remade the diesel engine, and it is no longer a noisy, polluting beast. Instead, it has mileage comparable to hybrids, and emits far fewer greenhouse gases than before. It's not a good idea to rely on fossil fuels for our future, but until we have more efficient electric and other technologies, this seems like a great transitional step. (Also, hydrogen as a combustible fuel is being researched right now and seems quite plausible, as well).
456	No, I'm not the one who started this debate, and yes, I will defend rugby. There are three main reasons why rugby is better than any other sport: 1) Rugby is a combination of running and fighting, and they run a lot. And they do it constantly, with constant attack and defense, with no timeouts, no dead plays. 2) Every position can score, and every body type has a place. 3) No pads. Rugby hits are just as hard, but there's no protection against the blow, skills are just as complex and beautiful, but the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers. It's just the sport, in its raw form.
457	It's obvious that coffee doesn't have any medicinal properties, but keep in mind that stimulants and taste good aren't medical properties either. Marijuana's active ingredient THC has been used for over 5000 years for many health purposes, and its stalk, leaves and seeds have been used for rope, canvas, clothing and other materials, so it's no contest. Marijuana ranks higher than coffee.
458	I don't know. You're effectively forcing individuals to pay to charity without their consent. Create voluntary support associations, with sensible criteria for applicants for support, such as being in the process of seeking employment or education, and then I'm interested. Tax payers will get tax breaks, as will those who have already given to recognised charities. Provide insurance benefits only to those who have already given. Even require applicants to return the amount they've received, if you like, but don't tell me what a worthy cause is. That's my decision.
459	The issue isn't whether or not athletes are paid, it's whether or not they're allowed to be in profit. If they're public school, the answer is automatically no.
460	This group is using violence to spread its message and intimidate people with fear, as noted in the article. This group is a terrorist group, as it burns forest ranger posts, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer, and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort.
461	As with all private schools, religious schools make money from their students, money that goes directly to them and isn't subsidized in any way, unlike public schools which have to rely on community fundraisers and events. Money given to such schools is as much like giving money to a stranger and asking him to use it for charity, you don't know how he will use it or what benefit he will have on his students.
462	I'm not sure that haircuts are the best way to teach kids, especially. For most kids, it doesn't really teach them anything "valuable". From personal experience, I can tell you that if you can properly discipline your kid, then there's no point in cutting his/her hair as a punishment. And when you do have to punish them, there's better ways of teaching them that what they did was wrong.
463	Criminal gangs are criminal gangs, no matter who they are made up of. If the police are not allowed to protect the population from criminal gangs, ordinary citizens will take up arms to protect themselves, which is understandable, but is not in the interest of the rule of law. Therefore, 'political correctness' should not be used to prevent police from doing their jobs and protecting the public.
464	I've been going to a ramen place down the street for a while now and always leave full and happy... So, after hearing all the hype about pho, I wasn't happy. I'd rather have ramen any time over pho!
465	This place is pretty shit. At 11pm, there was a fight and there were only about 25 people in the place. I'm looking at a girl who's basically nodding off at the desk, and she doesn't seem to be drunk if you ask me. Server was alright, they were out of 3 types of tacos and sour cream, which is pretty odd on a Friday night. Service was a bit slow on a weekend night. We enjoyed our company, but I don't think we'll be back for another girls night.
466	For over ten years, my family and I have always ordered from this location, our house number ends in 4949 and I, Sherie Arvayo, call on my cell phone. Recently, the employees have been very rude when they can't hear what I'm saying and who ever answered the phone at 4:59 p.m. today rudely hung up on me. Two months ago, they didn't get our order right and whoever was the manager must have taught the employees how to behave and speak unprofessionally. This is the fourth time in a row that the employees have been very rude and unprofessional. We decided to go with Papa John's because their employees are professionals and nice. I hope they close this location because we never know what they will put on our pizza!
467	I've had good experiences here before, but this time the service was not up to par. The food was good, but the lack of attention and overall demeanor of the server made me not want to return for a while. I really hate it when the servers take their time with the table cleaning. Also, instead of allowing us to relax and order drinks, the server took our drink orders first and then our dinner orders. Please, take our drink orders first and allow us to look at the menus.
468	I'm a regular here and I love it. It's the best Mexican food I've had in a long time. They take the time to talk to you while your order is being prepared, and their ingredients are very fresh. Their guacamole is my favorite, as well as their Horchata. My favorite dishes are Carne Asada fries with Angus beef or Chicken Chimichangas. You can't go wrong with this place. And if you have a birthday coming up, the food is on them! I always forget to go in and take advantage of it, but I don't mind paying even if it's the day after. If you want to spend a dime on great food, this is your place.
469	The bartender was rude and short, and immature. She was eating at a table and was the only bartender, which meant that we had to go to her to get drinks. There were very few people despite it being a Saturday evening, and I understand why. We asked for chips and salsa, and she said they only had nachos. We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa, which she brought for us. So, I figured out that they had chips and salsa, and she said "it's not on the menu". I suggested that she go into the kitchen and ask them to throw chips in a bowl and salsa in a bowl and bring it out. She told me I was being confrontational. I told her I was in the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out, she rolled her eyes. We will never go back there again.
470	We've been there for a drink, our friend had Mac & Cheeze and said it was really good, she even took some wings with her because her boyfriend really likes them. The outdoor area is really nice, though that day they let some kids in and they were really annoying. But other than that, it's really nice and relaxing to be there and have a drink.
471	The last thing a school should do is prevent its still developing children from expressing their creativity and individuality.
472	It doesn't show the expressions of the children, and the uniforms don't show, does it?
473	I'd like to point out that wearing school uniforms by young people doesn't make any sense, in fact, it's the opposite, it just creates problems between students and teachers. People between 16 and 18 don't like being limited, and sometimes a restriction of freedom can cause real problems, leading to miscommunications with other people, such as parents and teachers.
474	The uniform is a bad idea, it doesn't improve learning at school, students go to school to learn, not waste money on uniforms.
475	I'm sure that people who say that Firefox 2 has serious memory leaks haven't actually used it. The only memory problem I've encountered was opening multiple windows at once, or leaving Firefox active for 3 hours or more at a time (Known problem, which can be resolved by simply restarting the browser). And as for the argument against IE7, weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages of earlier versions. (Flexible toolbars, customizable buttons, who needs them?)
476	There's no reason for anyone to say IE's superior, Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and more elegant, you can make it look the way you like, and add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!
477	It's something that happened, a mistake she's made, and it's something she'll definitely learn from. She was brave enough to tell me, which isn't something many people would do. I'm sure it wasn't easy for her, but she'd probably just keep it to herself and wouldn't tell anybody. If that happened, which I strongly doubt, I'd definitely be her support and be with her, no matter what!
478	I'd never turn in my husband if he killed someone, I'd do the absolute opposite. I'd help him hide any evidence, I'd move if we need to, I wouldn't bring this up again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, so there, or it was a price.
479	I'm sure you've noticed that people opposed to books have terrible arguments, like the guy who just said TV's great, full of exclamation marks and capitals, which clearly shows that books are superior to TV, because TV rots the brain.
480	First of all, India doesn't have the potential to "rule" the world, because you've seen the people. Good Indians with good minds are in some foreign country getting Nobel prizes, while the rest are just jerks who do nothing and push people up. Nobody really wants anyone to succeed.
481	If you were a fatherless child, you'd only feel pain when he wasn't there for you, and you didn't know how he was. A bad father could have gained your trust, then walked away. Some would say that knowing your father was there is enough. For me, having a father who does nothing is itself an absence, because in either case he doesn't know anything about you, and you don't know anything about him. I'd rather he didn't exist at all, than he was constantly in and out of my life.
482	This argument can be argued from both sides, but I'd have to say that being fatherless is a good thing, because in my opinion, a bad father is one who's never there when you need him, or one who's never there to listen to what you have to say. And that's why being fatherless is better, because you can make your father whatever you want him to be, and that makes you a better person, and a better father.
483	I'm sure both are depressing, but I'd rather be depressed than have a bad father. And I understand that being depressed is a good reason to be away from your father. But in this case, I have a father, and he's not here in this land, and I understand that he went back to his country for some reason, but I still need him to be my rock.
484	When Raffles returned from his vacation, he changed the rules and concepts Farquhar had laid down in accordance with the needs of the populace, which is a proof that he cared about the people.
485	Although it was true that Raffles did not work closely with the populace to develop Singapore, he had drawn up plans and ideas and was going to put them into effect himself when he was sent to Bencoolen. It was therefore a sensible thing to leave his subordinate to finish the ideas.
486	"Founder" is not a person who "discovers" a place, if that's the case, then Prince Sanila Utama is the founder of Singapore! (this is to those who say Farquhar saw the island first.) And I know Farquhar was very helpful, sometimes doing all the work himself, but let me remind you that, as Raffles' "assistant", he still needed to consult Raffles, and Raffles had all authority over Singapore, so he was given credit. Then I would like to ask you why the names "Raffles Institution", "Raffles Hospital", "Raffles Medical Clinic" are so different from each other.
487	Porn is bad if it's not used in moderation. People who are addicted to it, in reality, expect all women to look and act like porn stars, but it messes up their reality.
488	Thinking about the man I'm most in love with having relations with other women makes me suicidal.
489	The example you give is an example of scientific rigor that is missing from evolution theory.
490	It doesn't matter how you believe the "Big Bang" came into existence, but it must have been caused by something. And if it was caused by gases reacting with one another, where did those gases come from?
491	I meant, in this case, both moths were present at the time of the observation, and in the beginning, both colored moths were on the trees... "Then the darkness was selected because of the changes in the environment caused by the Industrial Revolution."
492	We are at a point where the only way to evolve is to start creating, and creation is evolution with greater accountability for humanity.
493	Could a higher power that has yet to be proven create a perfect world that looks like it's been going on for over 10 million years, when in fact it's only a hundred thousand years old?
494	It seems that IE is much more compatible with spam and adware.
495	I think physical education should be mandatory because people need to exercise. If they don't burn off the fat they accumulate, they'll get fatter. They should be stricter in those physical education classes, because most of the time people just stand around. I don't want to sound sexist, but girls are usually the least active, and they just stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to move!
496	Of course phys ed has to be taught, but it shouldn't be compulsory, because some of us can't handle the extensive exercises that are performed.
497	This will help children develop good qualities such as leadership and discipline, and may also help reduce child obesity, because children aren't forced to exercise at home.
498	Certainly all those overweight children need exercise, and it's an integral part of life, which, of course, should be mandatory.
499	I agree with everything she said, because kids ought to learn how to live healthily. There should be stricter curricula that schools must adhere to, so that fewer people in our country are likely to be overweight.
500	Yes, our kids are mostly outof shape and eat too much junk food.
501	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the cornerstone of this idea, but it was left to Farquhar to implement it, so I believe Farquhar is the legitimate founder of Singapore. Raffles was just an idea man, before Singapore was founded, and he was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors, and he did not make much of a contribution.
502	I'd like to believe that both are true. First, God created the first creatures (I don't think Adam and Eve were really human, maybe single celled, but man had a hard time believing that, so we made the first creatures human). Second, those creatures evolved to suit their surroundings. There's proof of that, you can't deny it. I don't know if we came from monkeys or not. I believe in God and evolution.
503	There's no God, I'm just using him for sarcastic commentary on my arguments.
504	You're falling into the old argument about the "watchmaker" and not realizing how important self-replicating systems are in a naturally selecting environment.
505	I'm annoyed with all the arguments that porn leads to addiction, because it doesn't really lead to addiction, only in weak people, maybe with mental health problems, or attachment problems, or problems with separating fantasy from reality. I watch porna once or twice a day when I'm alone, but I have a great boyfriend, and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three times a week), we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom, but we know it's just fantasy, we're not stupid, we just have desires that need to be met!
506	I'm a woman who loves porn, and I don't mind if my boyfriend watches it. I think it's natural that people have sexual desires, and if they don't like the idea, then they shouldn't watch it. But the people who love it can watch all the videos they want, and I don't see a problem in that.
507	I'm a volunteer at Irving Cares, and it makes me feel so good when I make a difference in the community. In my personal life, it's all about helping yourself. If we all just helped each other, where would the world be? We all need help at some point. The world is about more than just me.
508	You can change the world for ever if you try to improve it for the common good. Many people have succeeded in that. Our Founding Fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King, Jr., and many others have made great improvements for the common good and have been rewarded.
509	Simply written Seeking to advance the common good opens doors and breaks barriers, and after a journey or series of considerate acts one can have an easier time pursuing a "Personal" goal or lifestyle. The word for this debate is "sacrifice". How much would a person really "sacrifice" for his or her neighbor without being blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? No matter where a person is in thier life... Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
510	They teach people about clothes they might need in later life, and they make sure no inappropriate clothing is worn.
511	I'm trying to see things objectively, but sometimes it's easier for me to have a dad who doesn't love me than a dad who loves me, because when you grow up and get ready for life, you need to learn about life, and if you don't have a model or a person to look up to, life is more difficult or less well.
512	It's better to have a bad father than none at all. You can learn from him, tell yourself, "I won't be the same as him, I'll be better." And he will love you, no matter what.
513	I'd have lived a life that wasn't right if I hadn't met my father, and if he had no job, no life, and maybe he was an alcoholic. But having a dad means so much, especially if you're a kid, because dads are also friends, and you can talk to them about your problems, and they'll understand, whereas if you just lived with your mom, you can't do that, because mom is a woman, and her views are different than yours. And whether or not your dad is a good one, he'll always be there for you at some point in your life.
514	We could cover Mexico three times with our water bottle consumption on Earth, which would make a lot of "rich" in Mexicans' minds.
515	For example, Pepsi Aquafina and Coca-Cola Dasani are both water bottles that come in 20 ounces and can be bought at vending machines alongside soft drinks for the same price. If you can find a dollar machine, that's five cents a ounce. Water from the tap costs less than a penny a gallon, so why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink?
516	TV's better, 'cause you can watch the world from the comfort of your couch.
517	Technically, I've learned English by intercourse with native speakers, but TV has helped me understand it better than books.
518	It enhances children's educational skills, making them more enthusiastic and self-assured. Children are improving their education, expanding their ideas and innovations!
519	Over the last decade or so, the global consumption of bottled water has grown exponentially, mainly in Europe and North America. The bottled water industry has literally created its own water culture, which is beneficial for American industry.
520	In terms of drinking habits, bottled water isn't the biggest problem we have. In the production of all other beverages, which has a much greater ecological impact than bottled water, there is a lot of water and energy consumed.
521	It is between a man and a woman that a gay marriage should take place.
522	If you say India can't lead the world, it's like saying a new baby won't walk! I agree there are many problems that rising India is facing today, but we're improving every day!
523	Hi everyone, this is a newbie to the pro-Indian crowd..........................................
524	Yes, India's potential to lead the world is huge, so many countries depend on scientists, and most workers in every country are Indians.
525	Religionists always use the same argument: you cannot prove he doesn't exist! You cannot disprove the negative! That is, you cannot prove that something isn't there, which isn't already there.
526	God's not real, so get over it, stupid believers in God.
527	I'm of the opinion that spanking is an option, but it should only be an option at the end.
528	I'm sure spanking your baby will show them what a bad thing they did, and if they don't like the feeling of being smashed, they won't do it again.
529	I'm in a personal relationship with Christ, and I believe that.
530	I can't imagine a life without God, actually, but it would be hell.
531	It's a mistake, we shouldn't insult those we trust, we don't have to know what you're thinking.
532	This is the dumbest debate I've ever seen. How can you explain to me, please, how did we get to be so perfectly aligned that the earth, sun, moon are all in their places, our bodies function perfectly, our hands are unique? Because we were created in his image.
533	People shouldn't hit their kids, because kids will think it's okay to hit someone else back, like at school, where they end up fighting and being mean to other people.
534	No, because parents don't always have to spank them for everything they do.
535	Is human dignity absolute, or is it determined by position? If a child is lying in an incubator, or, let's make this an example, a five gallon bucket, it's illegal to kill him. Why does the situation change so dramatically when a child is in the womb?
536	I'm choosing life, and keeping the law in favor of abortion is allowing women to murder their own unborn human baby.
537	No, physical education has existed for over 200 years, but today it barely has an effect, mainly because children are eating junk food. We should develop better methods of prevention of obesity, such as healthy eating campaigns.
538	I'll describe my experience with physical education: in all my years of public school, physical education was compulsory every year, which meant barely moving, standing and talking to friends, playing volleyball or dodgeball, annual physical fitness tests that didn't require any effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently, in an arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii sports. If public education isn't reformed, health classes can teach kids everything they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because physical education classes are severely lacking.
539	When I'm doing intense exercise, like when I'm running long, people are made differently, some of them have more stamina, are able to go long distances, do intense exercise, while others, like myself, have less stamina, can only do less intense exercise. Why do we have to make everyone be the same?
540	Physical education is a big problem, and we shouldn't have to take Physical Education at school.
541	It's not my opinion that gay marriage is bad, it's just that it doesn't really change society that much, so if you want to get married, do it, your life, your decisions, your choices. It's not a bad thing in some religions, and I do kind of think that, but don't let that influence your thoughts, just your opinion. Life is what you make it.
542	We have no right to go against it, I think. We all have different views of marriage. We think it's strange and disgusting, but other people might feel the same way, and think it's strange that men and women get married. So, I think it's all about perception, and we have no right, whatsoever, to question someone else's perception. We're all very selfish creatures, and we only see things according to what we think is right, and those who disagree with us, we think they're wrong.
543	Unfortunately, human nature is selfish. It doesn't mean that you'll always be a bad person and always do the worst for yourself, but a person usually helps himself first. Sometimes, in the right circumstances, pursuing your personal interests can be beneficial to the group. It's not necessarily better, but it might be more useful to pursue your own interests. We live in this life for so long and want to be the best we can be. Perhaps, your personal interests can be beneficial to the group.
544	It's good to help others, but it's also important not to forget who are really in need.
545	I'd say the first step is to focus on yourself, go to college, start a job, get to the top. I don't think there's a single day when you can announce to the world that you're doing something good for society, but you can help people here and there, give some time, give some cash, but when you're in a position of power and have money, you can really make a difference.
546	No one is fair, no one is just, no one is just; they rely on empty words, they lie, they plot evil, and they bring iniquity. So we are far from the truth, the judge is reversing his ways, the righteousness is far away.
547	CarCraze, I'm sorry to tell you that what you have here is a real court order to appear in court to answer a motion to collect a debt. If it's on paper with a case number, call the courthouse to confirm the case number, and find out when the hearing is. Yes, they have that power. Yes, It is the equivalent of a subpoena. If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and find a good chunk of it GONE! What you should do: Get legal advice (get a lawyer) and come up with a workable repayment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditors, and workable for you. Do not hesitate - you will regret it.
548	We're all short of time, but it's your civic duty to participate every once in a while. There are specific criteria that will exempt you from jury duty, but you still have to appear and allow the judge to examine your petition or request and legally exempt you. Be careful when you try to behave like a jerk in court and prejudice your responses. You can be held in contempt and perjury in court is very costly!
549	Since Bush got away with taxpayer money for Faith Based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional, but no politician will touch it for fear of being called anti-church, there's been a movement in this country to increase religious or church power. People don't realize how powerful the Catholic Church is. Do some research and find out how rich they are. They won't like it when China doesn't "obey" their (not God's) rules.
550	The issue here isn't whether he's battered the child, or whether it's likely he's, but I'm not a lawyer, so I can't be certain.
551	You can't handle all of these in one trial. Theft is a crime, malicious prosecution and breach of contract are civil, so the District Attorney won't touch them. If you don't have a lawyer to negotiate with the District Attorney, then your best bet is to sit tight, gather your evidence, and defend yourself in court. If the District Attorney wins, your case is over; but if he loses, you'll have a better chance of suing the witness who you think lied, and you can sue in civil court, and you might be able to do that without a lawyer.
552	The US is concerned that the agreement will lead to a greater restriction on emissions from various sectors of the economy, which will require the upgrading of many of the country's industrial plants, and that other third world countries will not be able to finance or employ the necessary expertise to implement the agreement, which will lead to pollution and low quality products, while the US will invest in new technologies and produce high quality products. But in the long run, the US will benefit from the agreement, as we have only one Earth.
553	The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, states clearly that when someone uses another's computer service (in this case, someone else's broadband connection) without permission, they are guilty of an offence. I am not sure how long the Act has been in force, but it has been around since 1993. From your post, I would assume that your friends have used the other party's router fairly recently. As such, if they are caught, they can be prosecuted. Arguing that the router is unsecure and/or does not have a unique SSID is useless; it is common sense that the router has to be owned by someone and if you are not in a free wireless zone, such as McDonald's, then one should know that any access would probably be through a privately owned network.
554	I agree that this was unethical and even insulting, but it was done in response to the suicide bombers, who certainly do not respect other people's beliefs and truths. What is the difference? s_s2 You don't see all the people who are Muslim but aren't suicide bombers protesting against the suicide bombers, when Islam is said to be a peaceful religion. It's the suicide bombers who don't respect other people's beliefs, they're even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq, but I don't see anyone protesting against that. I'm talking about the suicide bombers, not all Muslims.
555	I don't mean to disrespect you, but it seems to me that you were more selfish when he was in the police academy.
556	It depends on your state... Here in Nebraska the legal majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that require support through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a good kick in the pants!
557	The US doesn't want to steal Iraq's oil, it needs to control world oil trade. Basic requirement is that all oil producing countries sell their oil for dollars, which makes US paper money usable for oil. Compliant Arab regimes reinvested hundreds of billions of dollars in US economy if they're allowed to sell oil for euros, they'll invest their profits somewhere else, and US economy will suffer greatly, that's why Bush went to war with all these countries, to keep US control of oil trade.
558	I'm not sure that this should be a government decision, it should be a property owner's decision. I haven't been to a place that smokes, because most places don't allow smoking, and bars here in Ohio don't allow smoking, and that doesn't bother me at all. Maybe the next day when I smell my clothes and hair, but my breath probably stinks just as bad after a night of drinking. This is just a way for people to control and get money. One of the issues on the ballot, if you look closely, says money for a "clean air fund." If they ban smoking, why would you need a clean air fund? I'd rather my money go to my child's college fund, but if this passes, I won't have a choice.
559	If you'd been with your kids and watched them, you wouldn't need a registry to do that for you. It's your responsibility as a parent to watch your kids at all times. Also, 90-95% of sex crimes were committed by people in the child's family or close friends. Stranger danger isn't that common, and registrations do nothing more than give parents a false sense of security.
560	In Georgia, a child of 17 can't move out of their parents' home without written consent, unless another guardian is designated or you are an alien. Check with your local juvenile court if you are unsure. The only reason police don't enforce this law is because it would cost millions of dollars to do so and most police officers aren't aware of juvenile laws. Another couple of months won't hurt if you're really in love and you can finish school to make a better future for the both of you. Then maybe mom will be more for the relationship. Good luck! I've already been there!!!!
561	I'm not sure about the laws of Louisiana, but I've never heard of a state enshrining such an act. Instead, it's customary for both employers and employees to give two weeks' notice prior to leaving a job. It's a good idea to give two weeks' notice, but I'd be surprised if it's mandatory.
562	They have the right to end their services to you, if you miss a payment, no matter what color you are, no matter what kind of purple or green you are, they have the right to end it. It sounds like they've given you a few opportunities and you've chosen not to do the right thing, which is to pay your bills on time. And I have the right to say this, I'm Native American and proud of it, and I don't feel discriminated against because I pay my bills on time, if not before!
563	The sheriff's office doesn't sell cars, etc., (I'm not sure about furniture), or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
564	No one protests extradition of criminal suspects, but we all know that accusations are made against innocent people, and that not all legal systems are equal. It is simply that courts with suspects who are about to be tried elsewhere would like to be convinced that there is a solid case to be answered before they send them abroad.
565	Because when they were passed, some of the laws we have now might not have been so stupid as to have been passed (like the ban on eating meat when cows were very ill, and there was no other way of telling people about the dangers of eating that meat). It's just stupid to leave them in place when they're no longer needed.
566	The Nazis didn't act out of hate, like Stalin. They did what they deemed right. "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions". They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category. They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race. They didn't really hate the people. They just used the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions. We view ourselves better, and they as inferior, and they had no feelings, and no right to live happily. That's what the Nazis did to various people groups. Stalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly, and enforced a "Harvest of Despair". You should watch the documentary below:
567	I'm not sure that's the best idea, because when a baby is born, it's not an issue, but when it goes to school, it's going to be ridiculed by other kids, and that's going to make an emotional stress/problems for the kid, that's going to confuse the kid, no matter what anyone says. A kid needs a mom and a dad, not two women, and not two men.
568	The vast majority of the answers above make the same mistake that the question implies. It is not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination based on sexual orientation. It is the Establishment clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reasons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible (or any moral justification) to discriminate against homosexuals seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority, just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion. It is pure hypocrisy and pure religious discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.
569	I'm sure it's a great idea, because now all students are equal, at least in terms of appearance. And those who are less fortunate and don't have enough money to buy clothes, or who have too many clothes, don't have to worry about what they'll wear. It gives them a sense of self-esteem, and makes it easier to concentrate on their studies.
570	No, it would be hypocritical for any society that values human life and promotes peaceful solutions to include capital punishment within its justice system.
571	No, not if you mean that government interference in our parenting and responsible adulthood is intended to teach our kids.
572	I'm Irish and I don't complain about Notre Dame's nickname "Fighting Irish." I don't say I'm mocked or insulted because "people think I'm fighting." It's a bit ridiculous. If any indigenous Americans are really interested in this issue, they should look at poverty on reservations, poor education, etc.
573	But I'm thinking the bigger problem is figuring out who's leaking this information, and there are plenty of people from Clinton's era still around. Newspapers are in the business of slating Bush, so they're going to do anything to stop the war effort, and then they're going to hide under the freedom of the press. This is killing people, and extending the war, by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
574	I say to you, if you want a lifetime commitment from the person you love most, just tell her that she is your wife and have a ceremony in a place that you both find attractive, discuss your future plans and express your love for each other, and don't forget to think about that every day for the rest of your life, because that's what this is all about.
575	Your client? Give me a break, man. You're some kind of crackpot conspiracy theorist, first of all, your rant isn't a question at all, and second, the racism charges in your "question" make it very suspect. In fact, I'm glad your client isn't allowed into the U.S., because if he'd hired you, he wouldn't be here.
576	The laws governing the above vary greatly from state to state. For the most accurate information, you should consult an attorney who is licensed in your state. If you need a referral, contact your local or state bar association.
577	It's boring, it's scary, I won't complain about the usual sex. Shower time could get out of hand, really. There are some pretty good looking people in psychiatric care, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with them if you're broke and need a smoke. There are lots of good looking people in hospitals, and you can't catch crazy, so it's worth going for it. So each has its own pros and cons, but I would recommend psychiatric care over jail, and jail over my last marriage.
578	The U.S. has literally tens of thousands of water companies that are regulated by federal and state governments, so there's no basis for class actions or otherwise, unless you can prove negligence. If you don't like the taste of the water, drill your own well, set up your own filter system, or buy bottled water. But if you try to sue a water company, unless you can prove negligence, you'll never win.
579	Yes and no; in the short term, it would force the retailer to buy more furs, but in the long run, if activists continued to do this, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would reconsider whether to sell it -- buying merchandise you can't sell isn't a good business practice. The same tactic was used against private citizens; activists waited near large public events where they knew that ritzy people would probably walk through wearing furs, then doused them with either paint or something looking like blood.
580	The adversarial legal system is governed by rules of conduct and conduct imposed on both parties, which is ethical as it provides a structure for "fair play". However, a lawyer's job is to win a case hor his/her client, using loopholes in the law is one way to beat the other side. In some cases, this may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process that we have provides the best way to redress a wrong since a party that feels its claim was not handled well/fairly within the scope of the law, can in some cases seek further action through the appellate courts. This is as good as it gets, folks! The alternative would be Hamurarbbi's Sheria/Law, where justice is meted out in the form of chopping off body parts.
581	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker? Secondly, unions are legal and able to recruit members. However, this seems to be going too far, unless your boyfriend has done something like crossed a picket line, then he better know he won't be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other guy, is he really an illegal associate? Then INS could come in and send him back. You see, unionism only grows when employees sense that management isn't treating them fairly and respecting the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions, then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group. Unions aren't all demons, nor is management always the enemy, however, if that's how both sides of the equation present themselves, there won't be any kind of worker peace.
582	I'm sure there are people who are very clever and yet have terrible grades, but it's not a good idea to do badly in school, which limits your opportunities. I almost get irritated when I hear someone say that. Sure, that's a general statement, and doesn't take into account outside circumstances such as extreme poverty or illness, but I feel that 90% of the time laziness is to blame. I've heard the argument "I know stupid people with good grades" and I don't understand that. Even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge Please change my mind!
583	I'm slowly losing faith in morality. It seems to me that there is a strange quality that lies outside of the physical world, which cannot be justified by it, and yet it ties us to it by threads made of this also strange material. Why should I believe that I should jump to the conclusion that there is some kind of morality when the world is so clearly explicable without it? Why should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammal brains in need of prosocial behaviour? If I put a world with moral meaning next to one without it, the latter seems far simpler and lighter.
584	The first step is a home. No one should be homeless, everyone deserves a place to live, no one should be living on the street. The second step is food. Everyone needs food to live, no one should be starving. The third step is health care. No one should be able to buy better health care. The fourth step is education. I'm not saying that everyone should go to college, I'm saying that if someone wants to improve themselves through education, be it basic school, college, or some kind of training, it should be available. Now this is where it gets unpopular. The government should pay for it.
585	I've watched it with my family before, but now it's just cheap sex jokes and I'm ashamed to watch it with them anymore. The questions are designed to provoke a "dirty" response from the contestants, and when they do, Steve looks at the camera as if it's a terrible answer. Every. Fucking. Time. I've noticed he's gotten a lot of love on Reddit lately, and I'm surprised by that. Steve Harvey has taken the family out of the family feud.
586	I'm aware of studies showing young men are more careless than women, but that shouldn't be a reason to treat them any differently. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does that mean they should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I think, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I'm not a'masculinist,' but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]
587	I'm not saying they're useless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but as a source of up-to-date, interesting and well-researched information, there are enough specialized sources for a deeper critique or explanation of current affairs, and Twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that's particularly salient. I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone. I can get current affairs on Twitter. Any takers, CMV?
588	After watching Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I noticed how stupid that move is. I heard the usual reasoning, and it still doesn't make sense. They're providing us with a service that doesn't have to be provided. They're working hard, and they're usually paid just enough to cover the state and federal taxes that go into their salaries. Not tipping our servers is like a slap in their faces. They rate their performance based on how much or how little they get in tips. Be brutal, or nice, or whatever you like. Just be logical.
589	I'm not seeing any benefit in government recognition of marriage. First, benefits: no more arguments about what marriage is. If you want to marry your church, you can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner, you can. Government does not care. Instant equality. Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Second, this would cut down on paperwork.
590	I'm seeing a lot of discrimination and hate towards the wealthy, especially on reddit, which is morally wrong. America is often referred to as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal is it when it charges certain people more for being more productive?!?! More taxes and discrimination against the productive serve to discourage this behavior (or encourage it to happen elsewhere where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects), and our support system for poor people, especially in relation to reproduction, has made the number of poor grow by millions.
591	I've seen the headlines on CNN, Fox, and BBC: "ISRAEL BOMBS GAZA; WONT STOP DESPITE KILLING CIVILIANS." I've seen the numbers of casualties on both sides, and it doesn't add up. It's possible the Palestinians are taking up military strongholds in public buildings such as schools and hospitals, taking hostages (which could help account for the number of civilian casualties), and minimizing their military casualties by allowing the Israelis to destroy these buildings while under the impression that there are more soldiers there. What the world sees is the Israelis bombing the shit out of a bunch of helpless civilians, leading to genocide. The end result is propaganda against a UN-accredited nation that is "mercilessly committing genocide against a smaller, helpless nation" despite all of the tension between these two nations that led up to this.
592	The smaller the political body, the more control the people have. The best size for a political body is a city: large enough to have advantages of scale (pooling risks, working together on public projects), but small enough to avoid disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at Norway, which has 5 million people, and China, with 1,351 million. I say the reason is that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals.
593	Since 1913, William Taft hasn't had a moustache, and since then, people with moustaches haven't been trusted because of people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Linin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and so on. When the "fingerstache" meme started to spread, I was horrified, because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards humanity. To me, anyone who raises their fingers is like throwing a Nazi salute. It's a secret desire to return to barbarism and project their hipster (or should I say Hitler) tastes and preferences onto the populace by force. Worse, America's rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster, which can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism.
594	I know this is a sensitive issue, and most people will agree with capital punishment, however, I think we're letting these people off too easy, and they'll think it's okay to do it again and again. Honesty: if some jerk did this to your child and caught them, what would you do? I'm 23 and this issue really angers me. I chose the age of 30 because I think the age gap between 30 and 17 is too wide. I think this should only apply to sexual crimes, because I don't think anybody could possibly get excited about murder. I might be wrong, but castration would be a good punishment, because you wouldn't really be able to rape a minor without a penis.
595	If that's what young men are taught, then it's a sin to be horny, to want to have sex, to rape. If that's what they're taught, then it's a sin to be a rapist.
596	I've been researching this economic doctrine for a while, and I just don't understand how you can still argue for it in 2014. I understand that this was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed in the 1960s, but there's enough evidence to show that neoliberalism creates multinational monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, causes severe economic inequality, deteriorates social welfare, and perpetuates an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy are able to influence. I'm really curious if there are any real benefits to this kind of policy, or if it's just a way to accumulate wealth.
597	I've always thought George W. Bush would be remembered as the worst president in history, but now that Iraq is unraveling, I'm sure he will. Here's a list of his failures: 1. sleeping at the wheel on September 11th, 2. a completely false and made up pretext for the war in Iraq, 3. After starting two wars in the Mideast, engaged in a doomed attempt at nation building and bringing democracy, 4. a housing/finance bust, presiding over the worst recession since the Great Depression, 5. Cutting taxes for the wealthy brought us the biggest deficit and debt in history, resulting in massive spending cuts on social services, 6. And I'm sure there are many more I'm leaving out, but I think this is enough to get this conversation started.
598	The current "stop bullying" campaign is propaganda designed to prevent children from recognising themselves as autonomous beings, and is a major reason for more school shootings.
599	I changed my mind. In Ireland, there is football, which is a sport played with feet, and is seen all over the world, for example in the FIFA World Cup. In America, there is football, and the National Football League. I think the reason that American football is called football, despite being egg-shaped, is that it is the associated sport of that name in that country, while soccer is an alien sport.
600	I'm a woman in her mid-30's. I'm in a long-distance relationship where there's pressure to move to where my significant other lives and works. We both have inflexible corporate jobs. I don't speak the language he speaks, though I'm learning it (I'm learning it at an elementary level). CMV. What beliefs do you have that could make me move to be with someone I love but that would make me throw away everything in my home country? What else should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?
601	Powermat is installed at 100,000 places in the U.S. If the next iPhone includes a PMA component, Qi will lose the war. Apple users often visit Starbucks and Teavana, so this will be easy for them. PMA will be installed everywhere for the 50% of Americans who have an iPhone, and Qi will die. CMV To be clear, I'm in favor of Qi and I don't like data transmission that can be done by PMA, so I want someone to give me hope for Qi. Please. Thank you.
602	In principle, I think that offsides rules in soccer would lead to a lot more excitement in the game. If both teams are forced to spread out over the whole field, they'll all have more room to move, shoot, and generally have more fun offensives. This would lead to games with much higher scores, which would be much more exciting and much more fun for the fans. Almost no game would end in a draw, which is, in my opinion, the most annoying thing about any sport. Watching a whole 90 minutes of play, only to see neither team win, would almost certainly be over, or at least significantly reduced.
603	I'd like to start by saying I was a big fan of UFOs for quite some time, but after a while of following pretty much every new UFO sighting or alien conspiracy I could find, I've gradually shifted from being a full believer to feeling that all UFO/ alien accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony. Many of the most plausible seeming sightings end up being debunked as hoaxes. Similarly, many credible sources of eyewitness testimony, such as various military personnel in the Disclosure Project, end up revealing that they're looking to make money or simply lying about their expertise, such as Bob Lazar (whom I think worked at Area 51). I'd love to be able to say that aliens have visited Earth and this is all a big coverup, but I can't think of a single credible example that hasn't been completely discredited. CMV.
604	It seems to me that it only serves to remind men of traditional gender roles. To "be a man" is to provide for your family, be responsible, and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "act more ladylike". It implies that these particular values are only for men, and that women aren't supposed to have them (if they do, they're told to act like a lady). And god forbid that men have some values that women are'supposed' to have. Why not have a gender neutral phrase? "Act like a better person"?
605	The idea of Hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists in Islam and Christianity, as a perpetually burning realm of torture or metaphysical torture, reserved for those who do not join in the faith, or who do not believe in God, or who do not believe in the right God, is the most morally unacceptable idea I can think of. If this worldview is true, it causes more suffering than all the worst dictators combined. We are talking about billions of people who are constantly tortured or tormented for their convictions. Nothing that all humanity has ever done can ever come close to that.
606	I'll admit, I love Daisy. Her voice is terrible, sure, but that's your opinion. Anyway, it would be great if they used her at least once. She's a familiar face to anyone who's ever played Mario Kart since the Gamecube. Plus, now that Nintendo has a habit of sending Mario to places outside of Mushroom Kingdom, like Galaxy or 3D World, it would be great if they brought him back to Sarasaland. That would make Peach a playable character, justify her continued presence in spinoffs, and it would make the Mario universe more cohesive. So, please, change my mind, because this isn't going to happen, and I don't wanna die unhappy.
607	I've been fascinated by economics and money my whole life, and I remember thinking a lot about what qualities a "perfect" money would have, as I see many flaws in the current "candidates", like gold, dollars, euros, etc. In particular, I see a neutral, stable money as superior and with many advantages over what we currently use. As a result, I believe market forces will push more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior monies in the marketplace), until Bitcoin consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency. I've done a lot of FMA on this, and I feel very confident in the conclusion that this is inevitable. I've invested my whole life savings in Bitcoin. Do you change your mind?
608	I'm not saying Neil deGrasse Tyson did a bad job, but it would have been more appropriate and symbolic to have Bill Nye, who had been fighting so long for knowledge, as the narrator and guide for Cosmos, which would have inspired a new generation of thinkers.
609	I'm not trying to brag, but my grades are pretty good at university. This semester I've gotten mostly First Class, while my friends are getting 2:1s and 2:2. It seems like my peers are assuming that I'm going to get Firsts, and when I do get good grades, they say things like "oh, that's fine" or "is that it?" in a joking way. I don't want to sound arrogant, but I can't discuss this with any of my classmates. They feel like I should be "grateful" for my grades, despite the fact that I put in a lot more planning and writing into the work I submit. In the past I've usually had someone to compete with, but now I don't have that, and it makes me feel like it's just me." Am I being a bitch, or is there a legitimate reason for me to feel that my achievements are being undervalued because people are expecting me to get great grades?
610	I've just finished watching all 3 seasons in a row, and I have to say that the first 3 were more enjoyable for me. The storylines were more complex; the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the Jedi role... And there were some great set pieces, like Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs. Obi Wan, Jango Fett. Compared to the new episodes, the old ones seemed slower, more linear, and less intelligent. I admit there are some faults in the first 3 seasons, but my argument is simply that they were more enjoyable and more interesting than the last 3.
611	Metal is evil. First of all, the symbolism it contains can be interpreted as bad even by fifth-graders! If this dark genre is allowed to flourish, our youth will be negatively affected. Second, the lifestyles of its artists. Most of them lead very sinful and evil lives. Is that just the genre? I think so.
612	Ladies and gentlemen, if you're not aware of the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by George W. Bush, because of the many instances of "misinformation" that have been given, or perhaps not as a result, we must all agree that Bush is one of the leaders who should be impeached. Remember, Bush isn't the worst yet, but he's among the worst, and we need someone more experienced in US policy and world affairs to lead us into this time of need, even for just a couple of years.
613	I'm not sure why he wants to leave the UN, but there's a reason their last military exercise was to fire missiles over Japan. I wonder what they were training for.
614	People always keep their religion, no matter what, because they were raised to believe that. Atheists say, "God isn't real, it's a stupid idea, with no evidence." And we're back at square one.
615	I mean, I'm not saying I don't care, or that I don't get fascinated when I watch good space programs, but we need to focus our resources on solving the problems here on Earth, before we go looking for curiousities in the universe.
616	No, the world's not going to end NASA's going to keep looking, and I think 3,000 years from now we'll be hit by an asteroid. The funny thing is, I made a bet with my friend that if the world doesn't end in 2012 I get $5, if it ends, he gets $5. He said, "If we see an asteroid, I have to pay." I'm so excited to get that $5.
617	I do believe that is true, but only within reason. Physical punishment is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that it is a bad parenting choice to hit your kids from time to time. This method of disciplining has been a part of parenting doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. Arguments that society's acceptance of child spanking condones or worsens child abuse are unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are caused by unrelated issues involving the parent (e.g., alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spanking. Vilifying the proper use of child spanking condemns good parenting.
618	My friend is, in my opinion, being foolish. She's moving to Texas, where she'll be a minority, there are 13%of the population that's Caucasian, and it's mostly gangland, not far from Mexico's border. She's leaving everything behind, including family and friends, and most people are telling her to stay. What do you think?
619	TJ was smarter than Sheldon because at age 10, he had an IQ of 180. He'd skip grade 4 and go straight to grade 10, he'd do the work, teach the class, argue with the teachers, and he'd always be right. TJ could hack into anything. He even went on a debate show called Cross Talk, where he easily defeated grown adults who were very smart, maybe as smart as Sheldon.
620	As tempting as the "week debate" pun is (and it is), isn't it bad that the year is supposed to start in the middle of winter, so each year has two winters? Why would we want to cut down the length of the weekend by one day at a time, so that each end has only one day? The workweek is five days, then two days of fun, etc. I like calendars that start on Sunday, because it's nicer, but, aside from window dressing, the week begins on Monday.
621	I had a horrible experience here and will never go back.
622	I'm surprised I didn't write a review for this place. It's inside Planet Hollywood and it's open 24 hours. Great place to go when you have the munchies while you're Recommendations: Full Montagu... Beef and turkey sandwich very tasty. -Holiday Turkey...Wow it taste like a turkey plate with stuffing, turkey and cranberry. Very good if you like turkey. -Original...Just Ok... Beef sandwich and it was nothing special. Usually stick to either Full Montagu or Holiday Turkey. All sandwiches are under $7 so what a deal!!! They also have salads and soups. Line moves pretty quickly so don't let the long line scare you away...
623	This buffet has a great idea about individual servings, which is definitely more attention to the food than you'd get at other buffets. The service was great, although it was a bit of a "Where's Waldo" when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. The New York steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner, as we came during brunch!
624	Raising Cane's is a great place to get chicken tenders and fries, their dipping sauce is great, and you get a piece of toast or cole slaw with your meal. Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo as it is more than enough to fill me up. The staff is nice and fast, and the drive-thru is usually pretty easy. All in all, a great fast food place for lunch or dinner.
625	I live within walking distance of this gem and was recommended by some Arsenal workers on a night when they didn't have their food truck. The owner is very kind, makes everything from scratch and gives you generous portions for a very low price. The place is never too crowded so he can always make your delicious meal in no time whilst you window gaze at the busy strip of Penn Avenue outside. The Tuscan chicken sandwich was awesome and the hot Italian sausage sandwich when it's on special. You really can't go wrong with anything you get there, though. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!
626	We've been there twice and the first time was decent, but the steaks were way overcooked. We decided we'd give them another shot and order them rare. The second time, 20 mins to be seated, another 15 mins for food, and when we got it, the steaks were way overcooked again, even though we'd ordered them rare. The vegetables were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who normally eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. Then we go to the front to pay, 7 mins later the clerk asks how our experience was, we told her it wasn't good, she said "sorry, $34.24". We should've just walked out, I wouldn't have felt guilty, it was disgusting.
627	The pizza was alright, $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay, they pull the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card, which displays your order total, and whether or not you want to leave a tip. You have to click no on the tip, then sign. I would have thought that for take out orders they wouldn't ask for a tip at all. They didn't have a menu, you had to look at the wall where the menu was written in chalk. The pizza took 28 minutes, which was new, and their sanitation rating was 97.5.
628	Students should have a right to express themselves, and the uniforms are all alike, which is boring.
629	I think they're bad, because I believe you should be free and not have anyone telling you what to do.
630	The school district where my cousin's three children go uses school uniforms, and the reason is "reducing bullying", which isn't really addressing the issue of bullying at all. It's just removing or reducing students who are being bullied because they don't have a specific brand of clothing that they say is the "in" thing to wear. While that's an issue, it only sweeps the fundamental type of bullying under the carpet, kids will find other reasons to bully others, and it also violates their fundamental rights to be individuals and to express individuality.
631	Students have a right to feel and express themselves, but that's wrong, that's the education that makes us clever.
632	You have to choose your own clothes when you're not at college or high school or something like that.
633	I'm voting for Firefox, because in my experience it's working better than IE multiple times, and the configuration isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config will understand what I mean, and the tabs are great, and there are many good extensions. While not the best, it's definitely superior to IE, especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D
634	Since when is Firefox a Apple fad? Since the first day of its existence, more Windows users than Macs have downloaded Firefox. If you are "original and free minded", why do you use a browser with a market share of 58.6%? How is using a browser that everyone else uses "original"? The second paragraph of your argument doesn't even have to be rebutted, since it doesn't contain any facts and isn't even an argument at all.
635	I'd never turn my wife in, 'cause I love her, and we got married for a reason. I'd believe my wife killed somebody for a good cause, 'cause killing is still killing. Gene Hackman killed the guy that her wife was having an affair with.
636	I'd definitely stand by my marriage vows, no matter what, even if I didn't know who the person was. That's a tricky one. If I really loved someone, I wouldn't have turned them in, because I promised to help them through thick and thin, until death did us part. But there are divorces all the time, for different reasons, but this one's really difficult.
637	Books are better than TV, because you can lose your sight on TV, and your eyes hurt a lot if you watch TV too much.
638	Books are better than TV, because kids watch TV with bad influences, and most parents don't care what their kids watch, and I'm thankful books are better, because you learn more from books.
639	I'm a class 11 student, and I need to attend a dbt, so I asked you for more information. I'll be very grateful.
640	India could win a gold medal for corrosion, terrorism, illeteracy, violence, and so on.
641	I'd hate to have a dad that didn't do anything for me, and the odds are, you won't talk to him in five years. So why try and fix it when you know the outcome?
642	It can be either way, but I'm sure being fatherless is better than having a bad father, because sometimes they're annoying and they force you to do things you don't want to do, but that's just how dads are. You still have people to look up to even when your dad isn't around. I'm used to being with my mom, and my dad died when I was 6. So, I really don't have a favorite side.
643	I'd say it's better to be without a father than a bad father, because your bad father will influence you badly, and you might follow him, but if you're without a father, it's fine, but it's not great either, because you might not like being without a father. As long as you're without a father or not, they can encourage you to be successful in life and also help you correct your mistakes that you've made.
644	I'd rather be without a father than have a bad father. Fathers are usually supposed to provide for the household and deal with problems that arise, he's like an Alpha male, but if you're not good, then why bother being around. Kids look up to their father as an example of how to be a man and take responsibility for the actions they take. So why not be without a father when having a bad father is the same thing?
645	As a child, you hope for a father figure to be there when you need him. The last thing you need is someone who lives with you and does nothing to help you learn life's ways or answer questions that may be necessary for life.
646	Raffles had a vision of Singapore as a clean, beautiful, rational and modern city, and he worked towards that vision. But when he was gone, Farquhar had done Singapore a disservice, which made Raffles feel dissapointed.
647	Although Farquhar was said to have remained in Singapore to support its development, Raffles had planned, strategized, and chosen Singapore as another British base, giving early Singaporean support to the British.
648	I agree that William Farquhar was the one who remained in Singapore to keep it running and develop it further, but it was Raffles who appointed him because he must go and return to Bencoolen. He was also the one who laid the foundation of Singapore's development, so he should be regarded as one of its founders.
649	Raffles founded the Singapore Institution, later renamed Raffles Institution, in 1837.
650	Raffles had drawn up a town plan for Singapore, which included separate areas for various racial groups, as well as provision of other facilities such as roads, schools, and land for government buildings.
651	Raffles discovered Farquhar's bad work in building Singapore, and he also introduced opium trafficking into Singapore to make more money for building Singapore.
652	If you're living in those old times conditions for just a month, it would be a surprise not to catch a disease every day.Hospitals were one of the things Raffles built that would have saved many people at the time, because living conditions were poor. Another reason he helped in development
653	It's bad, it's bad for you, it's an addiction, but so is smoking cigarettes. Just because it's bad, doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.
654	If you're in a relationship, yes, porn is bad. It exploits people, it's unrealistic and can destroy a relationship. If you're in a relationship, you shouldn't need anything but your spouse for sexual pleasure, out of love and respect.
655	Okay, I'm going to believe that "God" created and then adjusted through evolution. We'll all find out in 100 years.
656	Ah, that's the classic argument about peppered moths, I'm very familiar with it, but I don't know if it supports evolution. Both moths have their colors, it's just which one is easier for prey to see.
657	It's as likely that evolution will take place as a tornado destroying a 747 Airplane.
658	I'm not an IE user, but FFX has many problems. First, it doesn't start fast when it's loaded from the disk. On my 3 year old computer, it takes 10 seconds or more to start it, whereas Opera takes much less time to start. Second, the plug-ins I use often, like Adobe Flash Player, don't work well in FFX, whereas Opera plays flash movies smoothly. Third, Firefox is still very young, and I think it's much better than IE, but Opera is still the best for me.
659	I'm writing this in Firefox, which doesn't support ActiveX, so it's not usable with the new Windows Virtual Earth, at least.
660	Chorme is better than all of them, it's faster and safer, plus it's open source, same as firefox.
661	Although Raffles had made all the preconceptions, Farquhar had made his own plans, since he must have left for Bencoolen, so he must have planned alone.
662	Farquhar had been the "mother" of Singapore, and he had done more for Singapore than Raffles, proving that he had been the founder of Singapore.
663	I'm going to take Obama's stance on this Abortion is never something a woman takes lightly. She'll always think, ask for help, and pray before she makes that decision. Pro-lifers just don't seem to understand that we also think aborting is a terrible thing and we hope no one ever has to face such a difficult and life changing situation. That's why this decision should be made by women, not some guy miles away in D.C. who has never been in that position.
664	If a woman is raped and then left with a child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatically affected her, she should have the right to decide whether or not to abandon that child. Certain situations require desperate decisions and this is one of them, the decision should be hers to make and she should be allowed to make it.
665	I'm personally opposed to abortion, but I believe in the right to choose. What matters to a pregnant woman isn't what I or other people think, it's what she decides about her baby.
666	Pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go in the U.S., and everywhere else in the world, people do whatever they like.
667	How'd you grow up? Did you attend church, Sunday school, pray before meals, pray after meals, pray at school, pray at night? I remember when I was seven years old, I started questioning the Lord's Prayer at school, and God. It didn't make sense, so I stopped believing in God and stopped praying at school. Thank God my public school system stopped that practice.
668	There's no concrete proof for the existence of God, and religion and the Bible are full of contradictions and changes, making me less and less convinced of His existence....Evolution makes more sense to me, animals adjust to their surroundings, and over a long period of time, they evolve to be able to live in different climes and situations.
669	I'd say it's a better idea to serve the common good, because it's more beneficial to give than to receive. It's more beneficial to lend a hand to someone else than to keep it in your own pocket.
670	Both are better to be involved in, but as an individual, I would like to see this society become less petty, and do things a lot better than they were before. Everyone knows what they want to be in this world, and to pursue their dreams without the help of others, and some people will help the community to make it safer and better, teach them what they are capable of, and believe in themselves that they can do the same things that wealthy people do.
671	It's better for me to serve the common good, because if I'd just go after my own personal interests, it wouldn't be so great, because I'd be making selfish decisions that would hurt someone else. I don't like hurting people. It would be a much nicer world if we thought of everyone else's well-being before we thought of ourselves.
672	It is likely that student victimisation will be reduced, as well as fighting and gang activity, because there is less competition for the most fashionable clothes.
673	Yes, school uniform is important. It's a logo for our school, and it reminds us that we belong. Also, when we wear our uniform, the teacher will give us a punishment, which can teach us to be disciplined. And when we leave school, the teacher will see that we have our school uniform on, so people will know we go to that school.
674	It's better to have a bad father than no father at all. If you grow up without a father, you'll always feel an empty void inside. And if your father isn't good, it makes you want to be better than him. And it makes you start being more responsible, because your father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father isn't good, but I'm still glad I know who he is, just so I don't have to worry about it.
675	I mean, growing up without a father can be difficult for some kids, like the ones who need their fathers to teach them right from wrong. But if you've got a dad, no matter how bad he is, you've got someone to support your decisions and encourage you.
676	It's better to have a bad father than no father, because fathers influence kids in a big way. For example, girls who have fathers are less careless than girls who don't. I see girls who grow up with a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to assume fatherhood responsibilities as they grow up, which shouldn't be.
677	The quality of bottled water is not as strictly controlled as the quality of tap water, so when you drink bottled water, you don't know what you're drinking.
678	I agree that the use of water bottles should not be permitted anywhere except in emergencies, as plastic bottles may leak chemicals over time. They're also rarely recycled, ending up on the ground, contributing to environmental pollution. They start to decompose in 700 years. The water in these bottles is usually tap water, which is easy to clean with leaves, moss, and some water purification products. Almost every water bottle tested contains bacteria.
679	The amount of oil used to make plastic bottles consumed by Americans last year is more than 1.5 million barrels, and that does not include the oil used for transportation. That is enough oil to run 100,000 cars for a year.
680	Estimated 3,800 tons of CO2 emissions per year from transporting bottled water from Western Europe to New York City alone. In California, 18 million gallons of bottled water were transported in 2006 from Fiji, which accounted for about 2,500 tons of CO2.
681	If you're not saving bottled water for emergencies, you're thinking about the future, not the past. You're drinking bottled water when you don't have to.
682	Nowadays, no one lives without TV. It's commonplace that everyone watches TV, so TV is better than books. Everyone votes for TV.
683	Television is important in communicating, so that we can pass the character limit.
684	Because it's a source of amusement and helps people who can't read.
685	While people recycle the environment, water bottles are thrown away and polluted. That's not the fault of the water companies.
686	Marriage is a matter for the Church, Congress doesn't have the right to force religious institutions to accept marriage legislation. Perhaps if the courts allowed gay marriage, it would be okay, since it's not a religious institution, and it wouldn't violate the separation of church and state, as determined by the Supreme Court.
687	Homosexual people are making a terrible mistake, I think they're living in a life where they don't have to make any commitments, and if it had been like that in a normal marriage, it would have been a lot better.
688	We've got potential, yes, but China is our sole competitor, which has done a much better job in the long run. But India's way of running things, it always brings order out of chaos.
689	Also, you've forgotten all the other options: Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism and so on.
690	Christianity: belief in rape, genocide, burning in hell, unsubstantiated claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking serpents, etc Atheism: rejection of these claims, based on logic, observation, and common sense
691	I'm just saying that people who believe in God are called "faith" and we don't need any proof to deal with atheists. The idea that God isn't real is your own words, and I don't need to discuss it, just believe what you believe. Both parties are in contradiction with each other, and neither side is really winning. It's probably a battle between two armies where neither side really wins at the end. Basically, I'm supporting Christianity mainly because of my "faith in God", and your proof that God doesn't exist changes the case, or doesn't change it at all.
692	I've been raised by a Free Will Baptist, and I'm fortunate to have found a church full of real gentlemen, who really did live by what they said. Now, I'm an atheist, but I still have full faith in Christian beliefs and teachings, but I see them this way: I believe in God, not religion.
693	I'm a Christian, because I believe in a just God, who will judge all right and wrong that we do here on Earth.
694	I'm not a Christian, but if you're Christian, you can't really argue with them unless your argument is about the same thing. Like, say, street fighting and UFC, different platforms.
695	If God doesn't exist, why are there so many prophecies written thousands of years before Jesus, telling exactly what happened to Jesus?
696	It mustn't be compulsory, but it must be a condition, and not more often than that. How would you assess PE if the child wasn't doing well? And if you could separate the boys from the girls, give them some good games to practise physical education, and the same for the girls, give them some ideas for games for girls.
697	It's not like marriage is a holy thing, we sell it on TV, in drive-thrus, etc. It's just a fake love. If people really want to be together, then who are you to say no? If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend. Plus, what will you do if your kids are gay?
698	I'm sure you're aware that three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups, especially against gay marriage, and they're extremely biased. I didn't even have to go to the sites to know that.
699	The gay marriage ban, and other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be invading this country.
700	I think the argument is that there is a debate about whether gay marriage is right or wrong. I think it's right, because I think people should be allowed to express their feelings to someone they love.
701	I'd say the personal goal is better, because I think that helping yourself first is a natural thing to do, and I think that whatever you do, it all comes back to you, even when you help others. Because you don't wanna have your life messed up by helping others.
702	I'm of the opinion that personal interest is more important than anyone else's, but I'm not sure. If someone in your family needs help, you'll do anything for that family member. I'm of the opinion that if someone in your family needs help, you'll do it no matter what. If someone in your family needs help, you'll help that family member no matter what. If someone in your family needs help, you'll help that family member no matter what. If someone in your family needs help, you'll help that family member no matter what.
703	You're not saying anything about your home life, you must have a very good reason. If you can find a job within walking distance, I think they'll consider that acceptable. I've had many physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home, and I still advise staying at home as long as you can. If your home life is the problem, get social services involved.
704	Since he'd known about it, yet hadn't gone to court, and let a lot of time pass, the court would probably see that as allowing it, but he'd have to go to court and ask for her to be found in contempt, and for her to be returned to the state. Much better chance if he'd done that before she moved, or right after she moved.
705	The point is, "Freedom of speech is a two way street." People have the right to say whatever they like, but others have the right to object, argue, and even ask for an apology. A liberal says something, a conservative objects, and the conservative is criticized for "violating a person's right to free speech." A conservative says something, a conservative objects, and the conservative either lets it go, or defends the original statement on its merits. Who is really against free speech; the conservative who demands an apology from a liberal for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact that you are offended by a statement?
706	The American public as a whole isn't thinking that way, and there's a lot of debate about this issue in our country. Abortion is currently legal in most states, but conservative religious fanatics are always trying to change the law. Obviously, I'm for women's rights, not abortion, not life, but because I think that since it's the woman's responsibility, then it must be her decision.
707	Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that uses it and you'll find that crime rates are much lower than in the U.S., but only if the nation is okay with it. On the other hand, it's immoral to take another's life no matter what the situation since you assume a position of superiority when you do it and every man on earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice. It's simply a matter of perspective. The typical Christian perspective is against capital punishment and that's due to this Christian country. The simple truth is that it is effective but at the same time, from a biased perspective, it's barbaric and immoral, and there are better, though not as effective, solutions.
708	The dismissal does not mean that the case has been decided, but it does not mean that the matter has been decided either. If the company continues to pursue this claim, or makes negative statements to credit reporting agencies, you can ask an attorney to help you with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. You should include copies of all negative material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected. Additionally, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change. In this way, you protect your interests - and, if the company is foolish enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
709	To answer your question and to refute the stupidity of comparing capital punishment to abortion: the fact is, yes, there are far too many instances where people have been put to death and later found not guilty. Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from ever happening. But generally, if a person has been definitively convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in jail cell and live off taxpayer money? If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live? Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT A DOUBT concrete evidence against a person who is placed on death row. And as far as abortion is concerned, unborn children have not committed any crimes.
710	I'm thinking that any pool in Ohio needs a fence around it. Let's put it this way, if you don't have a fence around your pool, and a child sneaks in and drowns, you're completely responsible, and probably lose your house, your car, and your wages for years while you're working to pay for the damages. To me, the risk isn't worth the reward, and I'd put up a fence no matter what the law says (but, I think every pool in Ohio needs a fence, anyway). Additionally, if you don't have a fence around your pool, you could have problems with your home insurance company if you don't have insurance.
711	It's funny, the law says you can't discriminate on the basis of sex, color, or age. But whites are the one group that isn't protected by law. Technically, it's illegal to exclude them, but they aren't protected. It's kind of funny, but how often do we need protection in America?
712	Technically IC Systems is responsible, but I guess you'll have to sue them in small claims court to get them to pay. My advice is to change your bank account number immediately, so they can't use it whenever they want. (This is the only reliable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you've given them permission to withdraw.) Then, make another payment arrangement with them. While you're doing that, write to them that you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 they cost you. Do this in a letter to them, and pay the account down to the last $120, then stop paying. If they keep trying to collect, point to that letter and say that you have a legitimate dispute.
713	We already have it, it's called a Social Security card. Any employer can call the Social Security Administration and verify information on a given SSN, but our government has made it so difficult to do so, that most employers won't bother. When you get a job, you need to provide I-9 documentation. You can use a passport, or state ID, and not just a SSN, or birth certificate and SS card, etc. There are already laws and fines for improper documentation. The problem is our elected officials would rather waste our money & time by presenting completely new regulations (justifying their jobs) instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have. Politicians are becoming better and better at doing nothing but creating redundant worthless laws. And we keep electing them. So I would NOT vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and waste of American taxpayers' monies.
714	I'm not following this politically case closely, but I think any law named after a person is questionable, because those who pass it often react out of emotion and grief, rather than reason. Any sensible law will have safeguards, and reasonable clauses, so that whatever action is made illegal is really the threat. I generally oppose laws that make certain actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation. That said, voting has become an emotional process. People, whether voters or legislators, pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long-term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines. And sadly, that won't change any time soon. Good luck.
715	No, not at all. It's precisely when we need these freedoms most, to be able to say, "I'm not comfortable with the way the administration is handling this," and not worry about being sent to jail. I may not agree with the views of others, but I will fight to the death to ensure that they are expressed.
716	In public opinion iraq does not deserve freedom like ours, we must continue to fight the terrorists who rule them. We are not dictators, we are freedom fighters who fight for FREEDOM, JUSTICE, AND LIBERTY. Unfortunately, people have lost sight of that and voted wrong yesterday. And morally, we are now heading in the wrong direction. People need to be responsibile for their actions and not blame it on science or society. Finally, for the budget there goes the state and national budget, economy, and our taxes. People want things to be in place for a better country and community. But who do you think we pay for it in the long run? We do it with our taxes, not with the so-called federal and state money people think we have.
717	The law is an obligation of society that a person must respect. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder or hurt other people's rights or sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous if you are likely to be caught. However, people tend to bend and break laws that have less severe penalties. For example, speeding, not wearing seatbelts, etc. Any law would be good if it did not infringe on human rights or religious beliefs of people. If you are unhappy with any law, you can challenge it in court or ask your legislature to change or modify it. However, this is a very exhausting and lengthy process.
718	I completely agree with you, and my pets suffer every year because they're starting weeks before, and the bigger displays start earlier, like the first big show I know of was a couple of weeks ago, in the middle of October! What happened to November 5th?! If it had been for just one night, it wouldn't be so bad, but it's going on for weeks, and they're terrified! Even though it's illegal to sell fireworks to kids, they still get them, just like cigarettes and alcohol. They're dangerous, and they're just another tool for those intent on being a menace to the public. It should be illegal to sell them in shops, and organised displays should be held just once, so animal lovers like us can help our pets with sedation.
719	Thanks for raising this important question. Most of what you've mentioned is beneficial, but dangerous when used inappropriately. I think Bush's administration has shown how our rights can be eroded, by proposing to keep prisoners in Cuba for life without trial or legal aid. Only by participating in government can we protect our rights, and I hope people reading this are ready to defend liberty by voting on 7th April.
720	If half the US schools think so, then they're not doing very well with history lessons. These kids must know their rights, and other people's rights. I'd expect that by sixth grade, at least the Civil War would have been mentioned, and the rest would have followed. Free speech, press freedom, religion freedom, etc. With that knowledge, you can understand why America is America, and not some British colony paying taxes on land we don't live on or harvest from. (Ha! These days, America does all kinds of illegal activities, no wonder half the country is lost and confused.)
721	In the realm of ethics, you should be informed about all the medication your child is taking... But legally, if your child is being treated in a juvenile facility for some kind of mental illness, they don't need to inform you if he's over 12. I also believe that, as a result of his or her incarceration, the state doesn't need to inform you about any new charges or pending charges.
722	I'm not a waiter or a waitress, but I think they should be paid minimum wage, no matter how much tips they get. They work just like everybody else, and when it comes to tips, they have to earn them. Imagine a night when it's slow, and they get no tips, or just a few, and they end up with, like, twenty bucks after eight hours of work. I think we need to change that, no matter what kind of job they have.
723	I agree with you that if someone wishes to say the Pledge before a meeting, game, class, etc., they should be allowed to do so. No one is forcing anyone else to join in and pledge -- they are perfectly within their rights to abstain. I really get annoyed when people try to claim that just "hearing" the Pledge violates their rights. What about my right to be myself and my loyalty to my country? I would think that would be more important than anything.
724	First, because this places a price on human life and dignity, which should not be sold. Second, because this is usually a short term decision, which can be very regretted if you live long enough. You're going to sell only organs you can live without, kidney or eye, but what if later in life you need to replace one of them and you don't have the money to do so? You're in trouble, possibly dead if it's a kidney.
725	I'm sure he's not the first student to think that. It's a given. You take a test to prove what you've learned. Obviously, he's learned nothing!
726	If the daughter was 19 and competent at the time, then all the papers were hers and no one else's. Depending on how long it has been since the documents were taken, the holders could be charged with trespass. If years have passed and the daughter hasn't tried to get the papers before, then they'll be presumed to be the ones who took them. You need a lawyer to help you.
727	It has been proven to many people's satisfaction, but there are those who are extremely difficult to persuade, for many reasons, but the main ones are faith in government, and do not want to believe that their government would murder three thousand of their own people. They will wake up at the right time, probably when the country is under martial law, and there are curfews, and they are prisoners in their own homes. But only the lucky ones, of course, while the less fortunate will be prisoners in one of the 600 or so concentration camps that have been built across the country, and are already staffed and ready to receive their presence.
728	The main weakness of any opinion poll is that there is a tendency to bias at every stage of the questioning process. The pollster biases; the pollster writes the questions; the pollster answers the questions. The first two forms of bias should, in principle, not appear in the results of an ethically conducted poll, but they often do. The second most important weakness is that, while ideally the sample set should be large and diverse enough to represent the entire population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both. Sometimes small and/or homogeneous samples are used by unethical pollsters to influence the outcome of their poll.
729	I hope that by raising my kids, and if I'm a good father, and I think I am, my kids will be positively affected throughout their lives by the values I've taught them and the examples I've shown them. I also try to do this through various mentoring programs for those whose reality would be worse without my involvement, and I feel confident that my involvement in their lives will make a difference, and that they will be better off knowing me than they would have been otherwise.
730	It's biased, but what would you expect from a company that readily gives the personal Internet search histories of Americans to Bush and Co. under the pretext of fighting porn? From what I hear, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questions and answers that promote the Republican agenda. And it's stupid to ask that question. Threatening the president is a crime, and even if you didn't mean to do it, it could be interpreted as such, especially by this president. But I noticed that they let many of your other questions slip through, which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive politically, they're fine with it. I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
731	You've been standing in line for free cheese for too long under the hot sun. Believe me or not, the wealthy do pay a lot of taxes for others, but it's the poor who suffer. The rest of your rambling sounds rather socialist. Are you suggesting that liberals are akin to socialists? I'd never in a million years have thought that.
732	To answer the previous post, the president can declare anyone, not just foreigners, a "person who might be aiding terrorists", and then hold them indefinitely at an undisclosed location. This effectively repeals habeas corpus. The president need not explain to the court why he believes that someone is aiding terrorists, so he could literally choose anyone, and no one, not even the Supreme Court, could require him to produce that person ever again - people can now just 'disappear', as happens in facist dictatorships.
733	I understand you mean "employee" and "unfair dismissal"? In most states, employment is at will, which means an employer can fire you at any time for any reason or no reason at all. However, there are some restrictions. For example, employees cannot be fired if they are members of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability). They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states. SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a "Contigency", so you don't have to pay legal fees unless you win your case. Check with your local bar association for a recommendation.
734	I heard that Australia and the U.S. have much higher rates of identity theft, because all that someone needs to steal your identity is one card, instead of going through tons of bills and so on to get all your details. It's a stupid idea, and I think it's going to require you to have an ID card to prove who you are, or you're going to need a passport, driver's license, or some other thing that not everybody has. But if they introduce it, and someone steals the identity of someone like the Prime Minister, and gets all his money, then they'll see how stupid it is.
735	I'm very fond of the start: "All rise!" And there's no perfect legal system. But I don't believe in "god" for the fact that he never talks to anybody but the leaders, which makes me suspect that the leaders are saying what the Lord told them! For example, every time someone attacks another, for the last 16 centuries, they say the Lord told them to do it! And last but not least, the Bush claim that America and its allies go to Iraq!
736	I'm a fair trade capitalist, a right wing extremist, I'm against all forms of Marxism, I believe people should be judged by who they are, not what they wear. I believe the solution to all problems in this world can be found in the Bible, public education is a waste of money due to low literacy and lack of basic economics knowledge. On this basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy, hatred towards Israel and Christianity will continue to grow, nothing will change, we've always had storms, and they'll always happen, we'll always have wars, because people are basically selfish.
737	I agree, except perhaps a person can't due to medical reasons, etc., but other than that, yes. SHOW RECEPITATION TO OUR COUNTRY! Our brave soldiers are willing to fight for America and risk their lives, and some people here are too lazy to get off their ass to declare loyalty to the flag. I think that's wrong. I'll proudly stand up for my country, and do everything I can to help it.
738	I checked, he still has the right to an attorney, so until then, if you can't pay the bail or get a bondsman, then I guess he'll have to deal with it until the court date. If he really hates it, then maybe he won't make the same mistake again when choosing a girl.
739	I don't know of any scientific evidence that shows that there's a genetic component, or a couple of genes, that determines sex. I think people just convince themselves that they're gay, and they believe it so strongly that they think they're gay from birth. I don't discriminate against gays, but the fundamentals of gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that it's not a choice.
740	While large company mergers are carefully analysed before they are approved, in order not to distort competition by creating a single powerful company, the acquisition of smaller companies by large companies is not seen as problematic, even if the value of the smaller company is enormous. For example, Facebook acquired Whatsapp, which provided it with enormous amounts of personal data, which is Facebook's main business model, putting it in a unique position to sell that data, but I feel that my fundamental rights have been violated, when Facebook gained the right, without my consent, to process my data as it sees fit, without offering me the opportunity to refuse or to erase it.
741	I live near a large naval base, and the whole community is very much in love with the military. I understand that it's a brave thing they do, but it's a lot more noble in my community to go into the military after high school than go to college, when in fact, most people who go into the military out of my school aren't going to college. And on the flip side, people who say that war is bad, and a big military is bad, are shunned in my community. And I see that on world news.
742	I've got an AK47 with a 10 round magazine and a.40 caliber Springfield Armory pistol with 12 round capacity. My opinion is that a person can kill the same number of people with a pistol as they can with an "assault rifle" and that a handgun is more dangerous because it's easier to hide.
743	I am not trying to argue whether road kill is bad or good for the environment, rather my emotional reaction to seeing an animal die senselessly. I am arguing that it is fine to experience no emotion.
744	Paper checks were once a convenient and simple way to move funds from one checking account to another, but today's technology (debit cards) means that they are no longer needed for employers to pay their employees. Outside of work, the only people who seem to be using paper checks are the elderly, who seem to have no trouble with paper checks and have no reason to change, even though they inconvenience people waiting in line behind them.
745	The recession hit men hardest, and they haven't recovered as well. Many are still unemployed, and fewer are going to college than ever. Meanwhile, women are being encouraged to go to college and fields that men aren't. There are many secure jobs with 90% females, both in the field and in the majors. Given the higher unemployment of men, I think anyone offering a women-specific incentive, such as a STEM scholarship, should be required to offer a men-specific scholarship, please CMV.
746	In my opinion, Nascar isn't a sport, and shouldn't be considered one. First of all, it's about as entertaining as watching cars go round and round on the highway. I'm not sure anyone can stand sitting in a stadium for hours under the sun, watching cars go round and round, and not be able to enjoy it. I'd rather watch cricket. The drivers don't even have to be in shape, their bodies can take it, so why would anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
747	In both cases, the country lost territory that was rightfully theirs, the authorities felt the need to seize it, one to secure its military base, the other wanted its holy land back also secured its military presence. Both of these events caused and continue to cause, in Ukraine and Palestinic, unnecessarily unstable situations, which naturally lead to deaths. Yet, due to the superpowers involved, it's common to make this an issue of choosing sides between the US and Russia, when the countries essentially did the same thing.
748	It should not be difficult to discover who was running the company, even if they had ceased to be active, and moral hazard created by bailouts is that business leaders keep profits while the costs of a collapse are borne by the public, which encourages them to take huge risks at our expense. Adding personal risk of death would be a good way of dealing with this moral hazard, and also redressing inequities in the application of the law. Right now, the sword of justice is falling more on the poor than the rich. I'm not a big fan of capital punishment, because I don't think it's effective in stopping stupid crimes; people who do stupid things aren't foresighted enough to think about the consequences, but corporate leaders probably are. They'll think twice before sinking an airship and bailing out with a golden parachute, because they'll land on Lady Liberty's sword.
749	There are hundreds of states on earth, and all of them engage extensively in initiating aggression against individuals they control. Sometimes, states' violence is a reaction to violence initiated by individuals, and this can be justified, like when a murderer is put behind bars. But most of the time, states themselves initiate violence, and people do not see it as problematic. For example, taxation is wrong, but taxation is justified by "social contract" or some other vague notion. We create euphemisms to legitimize state violence, like "drafted" when we could say "slave soldier", or "drug confiscation" when we could say "theft of herbs". These euphemisms muddle people's emotions when they meet such situations. One day, people will look at our society, which is run by politicians using violence, and will find it as incomprehensible as the Spanish Inquisition is to us.
750	That's what the title says, and I'll explain more by saying that I believe government is good, and that taxes are an inherent cost of having a good government. While high taxes do not necessarily mean a good government, I believe a good government needs high taxes to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that this entails. What am I missing? Why is it that a good government is the one that governs least, and thus needs the least money? Who ever heard of a structure that does its purpose best by doing it least? I don't understand. Please help me understand.
751	It's pretty simple. Men who are wealthy and famous, not to mention younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They don't even need any game to have sex. It's too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than half of men are able to resist that. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV. Therefore, when their wives/girlfriends are taken by surprise, they're being irrational. It's more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you. For this reason, I believe that women such as Tiger Woods' ex-wife were deluded when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.
752	I'm saying that since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villains of the two choices, they are a weaker section of Skyrim's story. First of all, they are racist. They abuse and mistreat those different from them. This makes them bad in today's morales and paints them as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly, Ulfric used Thu'um to kill the High King. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys, they have nothing that makes them good except for not being the ones you want to cut your head off at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me that the storm-cloaks aren't just some cartoon villains.
753	I think the word they're trying to find is hip hop / youth culture, which isn't just about black people. While the overall culture isn't so bad, there are a lot of things that have grown out of it that are bad for society.
754	For example, Christian A denies carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life on earth, and a lot of other crazy stuff. Christian B, on the other hand, accepts evolution is real, believes in a god who is simply a 'higher being', and believes in being rewarded after death for being a good person. Christian A does not *deserve* to be taken seriously, he can still have his beliefs without denying what is scientifically proven, but he chooses to be ignorant.
755	I've been in the /r/NoFap community for a while and I felt pride when a day went by without masturbation. But I've never been more than 2 weeks without masturbation and each time I masturbated I felt dread and depression, knowing that I'd masturbate again later. Today I broke a 4 day consecutive masturbation and I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms what I thought about masturbation when I started. It's bad for you. You can change my mind with studies or experience. Go ahead and try to change my mind.
756	We're all capable of the dreadful acts that Hitler committed or encouraged in his life, but given the right circumstances and social influences, any of them could have come out in us.
757	Anything we consider art is based on the artist's ability to connect with something in us that causes emotions. A lot of things we consider beautiful outside of the arts realm (fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things with inherent patterns, or describe something else in an elegant way. I would argue that the part of our brain that experiences beauty is reacting to the recognition of a pattern, whether it's external or internal.
758	It's impossible to say which sex is more intelligent, it depends on the individual. There might be some males who are very smart, and there might be some who are very unintelligent. The same might happen with women, some of them are very smart, and others aren't. Having said that, all the smart people of each sex and all the not-smart people of each sex balance each other's intelligence, so they are equal.
759	But there's no doubt in my mind that we have our own social problems, but the United States is still the world's innovator, while China, India, and even much of Europe can only copy our inventions, conduct our research, and imitate our military power.
760	Look at our bodies, we've got residue from our ancestors, shiver and have reptile-like snouts, our hair stands on end when we're scared, we all have tailbones, I'm not an atheist, I'm a believer in God, just believe God created the universe knowing what would happen, including that what was created would evolve and become life, and life would evolve and evolve, all part of the master plan, I don't have a conflict between my faith in God and my belief in evolution, nor do the growing number of progressive believers in God from all denominations.
761	The use of oil has already been over, the amount of plastic in the world means that simply recycling the unused could make more plastic, and all plastic is recyclable. Battery technology has been around for nearly ten years, which allows cars to travel for up to 400 miles on a single charge, which is more than many gas-driven cars on the road today. All production uses oil, which damages the environment, causes many diseases, and is the main cause of global warming. Every oil spill kills hundreds of thousands of animals annually, and its effects last for decades. Oil is the main reason for US interest in the Mideast, which is why there are many wars.
762	I'd have to say yes, but my personal convictions would never allow me to stand for locking up animals for people's amusement. Animals should be free. Of course, a large proportion of people wouldn't take it seriously because they see animals as less than human, which is why they keep them in cages.
763	I don't think that's necessary for the law. There are cases where privacy on the internet is necessary, but if you don't have anything to hide, or aren't cruising for shit, then there's no need to hide your identity. Isn't it annoying when people, for example, post shit online and are trying to attack other people, but they hide their identities?
764	Currently, pride has more talent than UFC, they have fighters from all over the world, whereas UFC is mostly restricted to North America. This isn't about U.S. vs. world, it's about there being more talented fighters to choose from at Pride. Crocop, Rampage have their reasons for joining (who knows if Pride didn't send them to promote pride in America), but there are still too many good fighters left at Pride, e.g. Fedor.
765	Don't tell me they're the ones who changed the way we make music, or that they're the ones who were deep. I listen to rock and roll to have fun, not think about life's deeper meanings.
766	People can see this in hospitals, where respirators, kidney dialysis machines, defibrillators are used to keep people alive, save them when they're on the verge of death. And that's not all, mobile phones, cars, MP3 players, and the notorious PlayStation, which we see thousands of kids, teenagers, adults playing, clearly show us how dependent people are on machines.
767	I'm not sure how I'd want to make a living, but what right do I have to judge how someone else is going to live? I'm having trouble keeping track of myself. Life's a way of changing the way you look at things when you grow up. I'm only responsible for myself, and I'll have to answer for what I do or don't do. Anyone who doesn't think I'm right probably has some life experience ahead of them.
768	I'd argue that people are essentially good. That doesn't mean that all people are nice all the time, or even that all people are essentially nice. We've all had bad eggs in our life, but that doesn't mean that we're fundamentally evil or selfish. At an individual level, people are capable of tremendous care and impressive acts of selflessness.
769	Let's assume Senator McCain is sincere, and wants to help bail out the economic crisis, in case he's going to be the next bigwig after November's elections. Okay, but remember he's admitted that the economy's not his strong point, and I let him slide on that, too. What's keeping him from giving up a couple of hours on a night to participate in a debate that's very important for his chances of getting elected? Because he's running scared, which is hurting his chances, he's showing that when it's time to be desperate, he's going to bail out and look for something else to do.
770	Yes, it is... There are several times "no" is the correct answer though; dictatorships call themselves republics (example for nerds: the republic in Star Wars). But in fact, are Republicans and Democrats the same? In both forms, people vote for the person or persons they want to "rule" them, people choose those who agree with them, only different is the way each country does it. For example, Denmark uses the method where the people (18+) vote for several people they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc. USA chooses 1 president... BUT STILL: The people choose, and that is where they combine and is the same, it is the people who vote and choose "chosen ones".
771	We have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. For some people, marriage is one of the milestones in their quest for happiness. If they lose their right to marriage, they may not be truly happy. All we have to do is ask, if the gay community can lose their rights, who will be next?
772	Although this is not technically correct (web 2.0 is not a new technical version of the WWW), mass adoption of technology requires two things: 1) Technology that works and 2) A name that people will associate with it. Web 3.0 is a name that mass marketers can use, etc. etc. I know this is a weak argument and it will annoy many people, including myself, if it happens, but it is a name that works better than semantic web - SW is not a name you see on cereal boxes.
773	I'm playing guitar and I don't feel like I'm not good at it. I think I can express myself well with this instrument. Oh, and Guitar Hero is great for dexterity, coordination, strength, and speed.
774	In a society traditionally, and to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that many men consider lesbians to be very sexy, because there is no male to spoil the aesthetic. (And vice versa, for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when a man participates, he is "lowering himself" to a woman's level.
775	Victor Frankl was a psychiatrist and during World War II he was a prisoner on a concentration camp, he said that in such a horrible condition he felt free because he could choose to be insane or stay calm, not only that he felt free, he was free, because freedom is choice and he chose people can say that freedom is the ability to do whatever you want, but this condition is a characteristic of freedom, every choice has a consequence, I can choose if tomorrow I steal a bank, of course I'm going to jail (if they catch me XD ), and if you choose a path, you should accept the consequence.
776	I think GRAW on 360 is the best MMORPG on the system, the graphics are really great and obviously more realistic, the gameplay is really great and provides a fairly open playing field for novices alongside more experienced players, the interface is designed in a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc. And GOW was simply overhyped and doesn't provide the same replay value to me that GRAW does.
777	I'm not sure how this compares to other burrito places, like Burito Boyz or Fat Bastard Burrito. I got a veggie burrito with a lot of hot sauce, which didn't help much and the fillings were very bland. It was definitely less expensive than the other, costing me around $7 for a regular size burrito, but it tasted so bad I'd obviously rather pay more for a good burrito! I definitely won't be coming back here.
778	My wife and I are regulars here, but the nachos have changed from a really great chip to something that's just okay. I guess they're just trying to be more consistent with their chips. We won't be ordering guacamole, salsa, or chips anymore.
779	My husband, who is from America and is picky about his stars, has had his fair share of New York Deli meats (pastrami,corned beef), so I was a bit worried to bring him here because I really like their smoked meats. And he loved them, so much so that we had them again before we left Montreal, this time without waiting in line.
780	I wasn't too impressed with my tea experience at Jade Mountain. I was looking for a place to stop in Madison on a business trip and found this place. It was very warm inside and didn't seem like a good place to work. The tapioca pearls were great and clearly fresh, so that was good. I got a mango fruit tea and it was just too sweet and didn't have ice in it, so it got warm fast with the warm tapioca pearls. The kid who helped me didn't seem too excited to be there or particularly helpful for a first-timer like me and I was a bit disappointed to get a regular lid instead of the fun shrink wrapped cup to stab the straw into like I find at most bubble tea shops. It was good but not great.
781	The burgers were good, but the price was too high for what it is.
782	K O'Donnells is the place to be for great food and great service! They have an award-winning dog patio, which I often visit with my doggie companions for socializing! If you're looking for a great happy hour, go between 3 and 7 and enjoy some food and ice cold beers!
783	I'm a regular customer at this Chipotle, it's nice and close to my house. It's in Happy Valley, which can get busy when people come back from work, so we like to go early or slightly later to avoid the rush. The line for lunch is usually pretty quick, the manager Thomas is great and very friendly. He recognizes my fiance and I as regular customers and always greets us and asks us about our day. I switch between burritos and bowls, with my burrito I ask them to mix it up and it's so delicious! I also get half chicken, half steak so I get the best of both worlds for one price. Love having a healthy quick option to eat lunch or dinner. Only thing I don't like... it's always super cold here, so bring your jacket.
784	We came here after a show at casino. The staff was not very friendly, but it was busy, so we assumed it was because of that. The buffet itself was very clean and nice, but the food was just average. For the $70+ we paid for the two of us, I would try another buffet in Vegas.
785	Because your clothes are coolio hoolio, and when you're allowed to wear whatever you like, it's coolio hoolio.
786	It takes the best of all previous browsers and puts them in a single tidy package, security and extendability are among its most important qualities.
787	I'm using Linux, and thanks to God there's no IE version for Linux! Firefox is open, you can do anything with it, and nobody's going to ask you about it. :)
788	Who said that firefox and mozilla are related to Steve Jobs and Apple? They're two different entities, not at all related! By the way, IE is terrible at creating pages and trying to make them look nice. FF is much closer to W3C standards than IE ever was or ever will be.
789	If my wife confided in me, I wouldn't have betrayed her trust, I would have been very angry, maybe even divorced her, depending on the type of killing, whether it was a self-defense killing, or she just thought it was fun.
790	India isn't going to lead the world, because there's a huge gap between the wealthy and the poor, and they still believe in a caste system.
791	It doesn't make sense, that no one country should lead the world, we all started together and that's how it should end, each has his own way. That's completely illogical.
792	syona, if we take a glance, most of us are unable to provide any real solutions that will allow us to remove the obstacles to our progress from the root. We are all very well aware of the problems, but are unable to provide solutions. We criticize government, terrorism, etc., but we fail to realize that as citizens we have a duty to understand our importance and role in the country. Because all people are human, then why do they create problems for other people? I hope you consider my views and respond to me soon.
793	I'd rather be without a father than a bad father. I'd like a good example to look up to and talk to, not someone who's never there.
794	If you were a fatherless child, you'd only feel pain when he wasn't there for you, and you didn't know how he was. A bad father could have gained your trust, then walked away. Some would say that knowing your father was there is enough. For me, having a father who does nothing is itself an absence, because in either case he doesn't know anything about you, and you don't know anything about him. I'd rather he didn't exist at all, than he was constantly in and out of my life.
795	I'd point out that Raffles had all the qualities of a founder, and he was in a great position to do this, and he invested big time, so we consider him a founder! We say Obama is a "founder" of health care reform, because he's in such a great position, and he can do things like invest money, time, and effort in this project!
796	Some may say that Raffles left Singapore for a few years and left Farquhar in charge, therefore he neglected us. Imagine SST, Ngee Ann Poly and NTU who have done so much for us and are considered our founders. Are you trying to imply that it is because they are back taking care of their own schools? Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time, would you say he is no longer our prime minister? Would you say he is neglecting Singapore? He has a life!
797	Porn is bad, unless it's got smoking hot lesbians in it. Actually, I'm downloading porn while I'm writing this.
798	Porn is bad, watching it makes us want to have free sex, free sex causes diseases, especially HIV, and that's not right in morality.
799	It depends on your beliefs, because I'm a Christian, and I think it is, but it might be completely fine for someone else who isn't.
800	It's not about how we got here, it's why we're here.
801	If the cure is genuine, find me someone or something halfway between here and there.
802	Hey, Nobrob, wasn't IE created before Firefox!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
803	Personally, I'm of the opinion Google Chrome is crap, but Firefox crashes every time I run it.
804	The majority of India's government sites are only designed for Internet Explorer, so it's good to have IE on your machine.
805	Physical education teaches kids that it doesn't matter if you're nerd or jock, because when they're all doing the same thing, they're all alike, except for the fact that they only pass a class if they make an effort. And from personal experience, sometimes there's a jock under the nerd outside.
806	The answer is so obvious: teachers should let everybody exercise, so they'll strengthen their marrow, become less fat and more flexible, so they won't be bullied as much.
807	Physical education should be obligatory, because so far in 2011, 112,000 people have died from lack of physical activity and obesity!
808	In my opinion, physical education classes should be obligatory at school, so that we can solve the problem of insufficient attendance.
809	Because today, when school's over, many students play computer games, which can lead to poor health, as well as serious diseases such as cancer.
810	Because real physical education provides opportunities for people to see what they are capable of, which will reinforce their self-esteem and make them more productive in their societies.
811	I think it's unfair that a man who made such a difference in Singapore's development should be unjustly dismissed like that.
812	It is not to be misused the right to abortion, but I do believe that there should be an option. No one should decide what a person does with their bodies.
813	It's a woman's decision. You can't control her. (Anyway, how do you know she wouldn't kill herself and try to kill her baby?)
814	If a woman is not capable of supporting a child, emotionally, physically, or financially, she should have the right to choose to abandon the child.
815	It depends on the situation; if a girl is raped, it's not right for her to keep the baby. If a young girl has unprotected sex and gets pregnant, it's her fault she didn't prepare.
816	The pro-lifers want the baby alive, so they'll grow up to be dead soldiers, right? Women are people, too, and should be able to decide what they bring into the world.
817	It's easy, we've adapted to the environment over time to what suits us best, otherwise why don't we all have the same skin color, why are there so many different animal types?
818	I'm a big fan of porn, masturbation's always a pleasure.
819	Yes, pornography degrades women, but since it's already happened, there's no way we can stop it. So we're going to go for it :P
820	Everybody has their own goals and things they want to achieve in life, but a person who helps the community and puts others before himself will definitely live better.
821	I'm kind of in the middle, because I always think that helping people is a good thing, and it's a way to get blessings. But sometimes you need to help yourself succeed, and make sure you're living and providing, so in a way, it's nice to help other people, but it's also important to help yourself.
822	Personally, I'd prefer to pursue personal goals, no particular reason, just feel that if I care about myself first and foremost, I can help the people I love most, and that in turn, this will make me a better person.
823	It's not a problem if kids don't dress like drug dealers all the time, but when they do, school districts have to resort to such things. Argument about individuality is nonsense. Is school the only place these kids go? What prevents them from going home and changing into different clothes after school? It's not the school's job to make sure every kid can "express their opinion." School is supposed to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a nightclub.
824	I remember every morning thinking what to wear, and that was a real problem. I asked my parents for new clothes quite often, and that wasn't unusual. It would be great if the school had its own uniform, and everyone had to wear it. First of all, it would look very nice and smart, and secondly, there wouldn't be any envy at all about someone wearing really nice trousers or skirts. Everyone would be just like everybody else, and studying would be easy, with no worries about anything!
825	I agree with that. When I was at school, it wasn't a problem for me what to wear. At university, I spent too much time choosing clothes. First of all, it's wasting time. Second, when all students wear the same uniform, there'd be no discrimination, no grouping by social status. A uniform shows that students are equal.
826	I think that uniforms are necessary, especially in developing countries, because all students do not have the same financial status.
827	If you'd like your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows it, but don't complain that your kids aren't doing very well, they're easily distracted, they're no good, they can't pay attention for five minutes in class. I might be exaggerating, but the point is clear: uniforms are here to avoid problems that wouldn't be avoided if kids didn't wear them.
828	I think it's a good idea to have a uniform at school, because it makes every kid feel like they're equal, at least in school. It also shows unity, makes kids feel included, and makes them work together.
829	It's better to have a bad father than no father, because you'll have someone to learn from your mistakes and inspire you to do better. You'll never think about how it would be to have a father.
830	I'd rather have a bad father than no father at all. If he's bad, you can fix it. You can talk to him, make him see sense. I don't know how it would be if all I had was my mom.
831	I'm not always in agreement with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes when he comes back from work, he just sits on the couch, watches TV, waits for my mom to make him dinner, which is pretty terrible to me, but at the end of the day, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him.
832	The fish are drowning, the fish are drowning. Don't be afraid, potato, you're not alone.
833	Books are bad because it's harder to spell lollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollollo
834	TV's better than books, 'cause you learn better when you see, not when you read.
835	Marriage is between a man and a woman, and that's always been the case. But, I don't think that should be rewarded with tax breaks, and I certainly don't want them using my kids as a platform to spread their garbage. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin, I don't want my kids learning that it's okay. This public exposure/support for homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality is out, then society is out.
836	I've already spoken my piece in the debate, and Indians have at least managed to learn this mongrel's language, and we're pretty good at it, while the rest of you English gimmicks are stumbling in your own tongue. I quote sush102: "Hey, it's better not teach me the difference between chat and debate, because if I start my debate then you'll be forced to leave this site and run away." What crap? "dnt," "ma," "dis" what kind of crap is that? It doesn't matter what you say, but Indians are the best!
837	India's economic growth is accelerating at breakneck speed, and the country could even achieve double-digit growth in 2013, as the Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Trade Minister Anand Sharma have said. Many economists agree that India's demographic dividend, which is a large part of its GDP, will allow it to maintain its high growth rate for a long time.
838	India certainly has the potential to lead the world... maybe in our real world power and weapons don't work anymore... maybe the USA, UK, or some other countries are stronger, but India is economically stronger, it's the center of many other companies.
839	India is on my personal list of countries that will need to be watched over the next 30 years, and I believe they'll be a decent contender for superpower status by the end of this century.
840	Even if there were valid proof that God exists, there would be no valid proof that He is Christian or not.
841	It's your decision to spank, kids can be bad, but only as an extreme measure.
842	I agree, but it must be used as a final source, not used continuously, and not too difficult.
843	I'd answer yes, because kids are becoming more and more violent, and when they decide to act out, they need discipline.
844	Yes, because if they're scared of being spanked, then they won't do it again. The parent should only spank them, not go overboard and keep hitting them.
845	Humans have been raised for a thousand years without much resentment towards spanking, and today's kids are the most rebellious ever... There's a trend, though I admit it's not just spanking that's the cause, but a part of a larger picture.
846	I'm a Christian, so I must support my religion and attend church.
847	I'm neither atheist nor a Christian, but I think Christianity is superior to atheism.Life isn't worth calling it if you don't have God in it.
848	I'd be glad to have killed my husband, and I'd be glad to have gone to jail for murder, and I wouldn't have felt safe in our house or sleeping next to her for months, or years.
849	I'd agree, because my wife would be a murderer. Being a murderer in a marriage isn't the best life you can have, knowing that every day you'll be under so much stress, worrying whether the cops will come and take you for being involved in a crime, or even if your life is in danger.
850	I'd have to say yes, she killed someone, which can get you in big trouble, even if you're just accompanying her. No matter the reason, it might have been an accident, somebody might have tried to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone. And as soon as she tells me, I'll call the cops, in case she either goes on a killing spree or decides to kill me.
851	Whoever bestows life is who bestows death
852	In my opinion, abortion as it is today is a form of last resort contraception, if you're not smart enough to use protection, take the pill, give up the baby, there are thousands of women who can't have children but would love to.
853	The embryo is considered human, its heartbeat starts on the 21st day of conception, so even if we can't see the human form, it has the potential to acquire one.Abortion is carried out by 60% of women who are not married.Why can't a woman give the child up for adoption instead, even if she is raped? If you are raped, does that give you the right to go out and kill someone?
854	I'm defending the rights of a child, who deserves the same right to life as his mother.
855	There are many students who do not like Physical Education, so it should be an optional subject.
856	That's not a common knowledge, can you give me a reference? Or are you suggesting that homosexuality is a vector for the spread of AIDS? If so, gay marriage might be able to alleviate the problem.
857	I've got so many gay friends, and I'm very much for it. People shouldn't be so against it. They can't avoid it. I've watched a lot of shows about it, and I've seen how gays feel when people look at them, and some of them feel like they're being watched. It's not right. We're all people.
858	I'm convinced that everyone deserves to be happy. I've got two good friends who are gay, one female, and the other male. I don't have a problem with them being around each other, or when they're with their partners.
859	It seems to me that the personal goal is better, that is, how can you serve the common good if you can't improve yourself.
860	I don't think many countries consider a man having sex with another man acceptable. It's almost always taboo in society, and the main religions. I doubt if people will ever really accept a man having sex with another man, but they should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that's what they do. Ignorant people mix them up, and that's their business.
861	Yes, they have more power than they say. Since September 11, 2001, the government has enacted laws such as "The Patriot Act" and "Terror Watch", which allow the government to basically spy on law-abiding citizens, even though that is against the Constitution. The Patriot Act also allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records of law-abiding citizens, as well as the ability to search cars, homes, and businesses without warrants, which is also against the Constitution.
862	I'm a firefighter/paramedic, and I drive Code 3 all the time. The dangeriest part of my job is just getting to the emergency, and there are plenty of cars that don't stop immediately. The idiots who don't stop are usually on the phone, too preoccupied to look around. Handsfree phones aren't much help either. You can talk to a passenger in your car without any problem, because they can see what's happening in the traffic, and sometimes they can even point out things for the driver, but the person on the other end of the line is just a distraction, and doesn't do anything to help.
863	I'm not really a believer in Psychics, but when a person is desperate, most people, including myself, will do anything to help. A friend of mine, whose sister had been missing for nearly 2 years, finally decided to use a Psychic. The family and the Psychic found her body.
864	If you're worried, go back into the chat room and ask them how they're protecting you. I don't think they'll be able to trace you due to data protection, but if you're still worried, contact the cops, explain the situation, say you're worried, and they'll do anything to protect you.
865	The problem isn't the question itself, and an honest answer, it's the ramifications of that answer.
866	I know that most countries that allow abortion allow it only in the first trimester of pregnancy, when the fetus isn't even called 'fetus' anymore, but 'embryo', which, if you've seen pictures of, doesn't even look like a human, and has no brain function, so it can't feel pain, and doesn't know it's there (for those who want to know how you can be sure, I can only say that I'm not, and that's just what I know). By then, the fetus is pretty much a person, though it can't live on its own, and it's a crime to remove it. Please keep in mind that very few women who have had an abortion see this issue in such black and white terms, and that each of them wrestles with their morals and conscience in their own way.
867	I'm horrified by the way kids are using the word "spastic" as an insult. What are they learning at home to be so insensitive? It's not getting better. I once had a job to recruit a typist, and I told Human Resources that maybe this could be a job for a disabled person who might have had trouble getting work otherwise. I got a blank stare, "Any particular disability?" I asked. I have a son who, at age 12, is disabled, and he's looking for a job that will pay him well, but he's seen too much of people's attitudes. In many ways, we still live in the jungle.
868	It's legal to shoot if you feel threatened, and I'd shoot first, ask questions later on for all policemen who are trying to do their job.
869	I assume you mean the entire criminal justice system, which includes both the police and the legal profession, and includes the lawmakers, too. Public policy isn't always easy to define, but we know that in an ideal democracy, power and influence would be derived from the people. Young money sways public opinion, buys almost any election, and swayes almost any vote, whether it's public or legislative. I'm not sure what you mean by "playing policy roles." The direct enforcers offer direct power, the police and the judges. But those who actually make the laws provide real power, and that comes back to the people with money to buy influence, which is really just a way of influencing the laws. It's all about the wealthy and powerful.
870	I doubt the police will do anything about this, but a lawsuit would be costly and unpleasant for both parties. It's better to let it go, walk on the high ground, live your life honestly, knowing that these people are petty and unworthy of your attentions. Light always shines out of darkness, and I'm sure the people who know you know your character.
871	I say, kill them all, the problem is solved.
872	Lawyers are foxes, they usually only ask questions to which they already know the answers, they use many methods to make you say what they want, unless, of course, they're defending or defending you. Some lawyers talk very loudly, trying to shake you up, making you feel uneasy, and they try to question the truth of your statements. Be careful! The best way to deal with this is, I think, to keep a cool head, be calm at all times, because if you seem uneasy, you could lose your case.
873	Criminals will find a way, be it gun, knife, baseball bat...It's just a "feel good" law, that makes liberals feel like they're doing something to fight crime, while allowing criminals to run amok. Statistics show that criminals do less when they're facing a well-armed citizen, and crime rates go down. For the record, the Second Amendment is there not to protect our hunting rights, but to give us the ability to fight back against a government that's out of control. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't exactly equal.
874	I'm a person who can read a legal book as easily as I can read a comic book. First, you need a lawyer. That constitutional right to sue on your own is wiped out by judges who don't want to be bothered by non-lawyers. Second, you need evidence that the person's actions caused you "increased anxiety." As the testimony of a therapist. Then, it depends on your state laws. This is a difficult case to prove, you might even have to prove the person should have known his actions would harm you. Get in touch with Legal Aid, or the Attorney General's office to see if they have any information on how you can make the elements of a winning case.
875	It matters to those of us who went to school where all this was important, or had parents who cared, or had jobs where it mattered, or just lived life without any of this, then you might conclude that it's all rather irrelevant, and who would blame you?
876	You know, there's something called freedom. Maybe your grandfather died for it, but people are free to speak and write how they like, and if you don't like it, you don't have to talk to them or do business in places that serve Spanish speaking customers. I mean, in Chinese towns across America, for years, Chinese and other Asians have been spoken and advertised. The government has a lot to do before it has to worry about what language people are speaking, and as your kind often say, if you don't like how America does it, maybe you should go.
877	Unfortunately, oil is the ruler of all politics. But I can suggest a simple alternative which is, at first glance, utterly logical: use wind or wave power to produce electricity, break water into its basic components, release oxygen into the atmosphere, burn hydrogen in cars, leaving water as a by-product. It would work almost anywhere on your backyard! We would only need lubricants then, which could probably be made from plant sources!
878	From an ethical point of view, you should repay her. She made it clear that it was a loan, and you accepted the terms. However, I believe that ethically, she should forgive some of the debt, because she was behind in what she was supposed to pay you.
879	It would be legal, and the government could tax it to the fullest. Then again, they could just as easily fire people for possession of drugs, and let the more violent criminals go free.
880	You're not going to get a warrant,I'm sure they've issued one,but they don't have to tell you that they've issued it.Call the court and make the payment.You'll have to pay the original fine,the warrant fee,possibly interest,and whatever else the local laws allow them to add on.Or you can just ignore it,and the next time you're pulled over for a simple traffic offence,they can arrest you on an outstanding warrant.
881	Don't bash Clinton! He's eliminated the deficit, and for a time we were in surplus, and all the while we survived, and the economy was great. Bush sucked it up, and now we have this deficit of eight billion dollars or something? Who's paying for the war in Iraq? Who's paying for the rebuilding of this country? Where is the Iraqi oil money? They're selling oil. Where do you think that money is going?
882	In my opinion, psychological treatment is more effective than sending criminals to jail. No one is born a criminal, and the main reason for being such is a bad upbringing.
883	We've got a bunch of Old Boys up there scratching each other's backs, making a living off us, making a career out of it. We need to pass term limits for both houses and senate, get those 80-year-old geysers outta there, they've earned their entire life pension and benefits. Good people go into D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves, so they need to help pass somebody else's bill that is established in D.C. and knows how the system works, the Old Boys System. The Old Boys just wait for the right time, keep the system going, and block everything else. They're working for themselves. All incumbents -- OUT!
884	I'm not sure you were fined for throwing a butt out your window, unless your area is at risk for forest fires, then I might understand. The best thing you could do is fight it in court and try to discredit the officer's observation. Was it raining, foggy, parked on the side of the road behind some vegetation? Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown a cigarette out? The main thing you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?" If you think you'll win, then by all means try, that's what our justice system is all about, the only downside is that you might lose the case and then have to pay your fine, plus court costs.
885	Yes, you are responsible for them when they are in your car and you are driving. I'm not sure about Illinois, but in California, if one of your passengers isn't wearing a seatbelt, you can get a ticket for that, plus a ticket for them, even if they are adults. If they aren't in your car, or even just if you aren't driving, you aren't responsible for them unless you and their parents sign something stating that you are.
886	You've got to be careful how you play this game, because if he can prove that anything you say about him isn't true, he can use that as a basis for defamation. If he's wronged you, there are a few things you can do: 1. sue him for wrongdoing. 2. Get in touch with your local Better Business Bureau. 3. Report what he did to the government group that regulates car dealers in your area. 4. Contact a TV station in your area that airs complaints about customers.
887	You should consult a lawyer. You might lose your job and your house due to lack of money. You have nothing to lose! Your kids might starve. You might lose everything you have. Do something before that happens! The company will be heartbroken, I'm sure! Most of them couldn't care less about there people, and will try to get you to quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment. I've seen it too many times. Just ask a lawyer about your case, they don't have to know you asked them. The lawyer will tell you if you even have a chance. It won't cost you anything to ask!
888	It's sad to say, but some of our prisons are run by gangs inside. Prisoners are so well taken care of, they don't even act as deterrents anymore.
889	I'm not sure how he could have taken the kids from their mother, that's a very difficult thing to do in court, but if your sister wants her family back so badly, and thinks that if she doesn't have it back, her life doesn't have meaning, then support her, but remind her to be careful and try to save some money on the side for herself, just in case. Maybe he really loves her and realized that life isn't always greener on the other side, and now he wants his old happy life back, just help her secretly to save some money for that. I wish your sister all the best.
890	If government agencies like the NSA are allowed to listen to or read private telephone calls or e-mails, or otherwise search private communications of people who live here, whether they are citizens or not, *without* the scrutiny and oversight of judges, who are, in the end, accountable to the courts and to the people, they are creating an area within the state that is exempt from the sovereignty of the people. This undermines democracy (however fake that democracy is anyway), and creates a state within the state, which is usually thought to be a distinguishing feature of dictatorships, where secret services, torturers, etc. are also not accountable to the courts and to the people.
891	Why am I a gay man, can get kicked out of any job in this country for being gay, can't get a civil union with my partner of 9 years, no domestic partner rights, hell, if it was up to them I'd be better off on some deserted island with like-minded people, not free, but still grateful to be an American and to those fighting for what rights I do have.
892	After all, a woman's body will tell her when she's ready, she'll start menstruation, but being mature enough is another matter entirely!
893	You can be emancipated if you're not pregnant, but that's a pretty obvious reason for a judge to grant your request. I did it. It took me like 30 minutes to fill out forms, sign some papers, and five minutes before a judge. It was pretty easy, actually, and I would definitely recommend it if you need to sign stuff on behalf of your baby. Most people won't question you, but it's good to have in your back pocket, just in case.
894	I don't think it's right that when people are sentenced to capital punishment, all they're suffering is a lethal injection and when they die, they have no worries. But the person or family they committed the crime against is usually tortured and suffering for the rest of their lives!
895	Companies can advertise that their products are superior to their competitors' products, and they are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their advertising, which stimulates competition, and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights. By the way, there's no such thing as truth in advertising, so no evidence is needed to make such claims.
896	I believe our lives are ours and no one has the right to take them except ourselves. If the pain, suffering and lack of hope are unbearable, then we should have the right to end it, either by doing it ourselves or by asking someone else to do it for us. For example, my country sends to jail anyone who fails suicide attempt, which I find ridiculous, for obvious reasons. And if the person can't do it themselves, they ask someone else to do it, either by ending her life through "direct" methods such as painless poisoning or by "indirect" methods such as stopping the machine that keeps her heart beating. Please, keep in mind I'm talking about voluntary euthanasia, not non-voluntary euthanasia or involuntary euthanasia.
897	From a physical and chemical point of view, neurons fire when we see, smell, hear, touch, or taste things. Then, through chemical processes that are well understood, those neurons interact with other neurons, and so on, and so forth... Eventually, motor neurons are stimulated, which causes us to respond to the sensory input. But, given the exact same situation, our brains will react exactly the same way every time, so you basically didn't have a choice.
898	My reasoning is simple: - dishwashers require the dishes to be "pre-cleaned". This already defeats the purpose, why did I pay hundreds of dollars for a machine that doesn't process food? - dishwashers rarely remove ingrained or dried gunk. This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher for a few days, and the older plates are already dried out. You have to take the still dirty plates and clean them manually. - dishwashers don't properly dry "deep" items like Tupperware and pots, if you aren't careful taking them out, you'll get everything else wet, once again making the process useless.
899	"white privilege" is the idea that whites live in easy, privileged lives. It's the same as assuming that all black people grow up in the hood, join gangs, and are fortunate to even go to college. Not all African-Americans grow up poor, and not all whites live in luxury. There's a mentality that if a white person is discriminated against, they somehow "deserve" it because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.
900	The invasion of Gaza is not justified, and it's not feasible. It's the same as Iraq, you don't stop terrorism by destroying lives. Palestinians already despise Israel, and a terror attack in Gaza only radicalizes the population, turning them into Hamas militants. Besides, Israel has shown blatant disregard for civilian lives, 50 israelis have died compared to 1,500 palestinians, which should make you understand who's aggressor and who's victim. This isn't about Hamas and Israel, it's about people who were born in Gaza and are caught up in it.
901	I have many more, but I'll wait until the debate begins to state them.
902	Governments are using propaganda to convince people that a soda tax will reduce obesity, but in reality, they're just greedy trying to make more money off the poor and middle class.
903	I'm aware tastes vary, but this movie was just plain boring to me. The only interesting parts were the Ouija board scene and the end. The rest was just people sleeping with occasional noises. I can appreciate slow build movies, but this was just plain boring.
904	I think people should have a right to explore their own consciousness, provided they don't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously laws similar to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public and so on. Psychedelics, as I described, aren't addictive and aren't known to be harmful.
905	People with diabetes, people on ventilators, people on dialysis, people with organ transplants, all of them would die relatively quick if they didn't have industrial systems to make the insulin they need. It's impossible to make insulin outside of industrial systems. Before modern times, people with type I diabetes simply died from a diabetic coma. Is there any way to make insulin outside of industrial systems? If not, then I think 3 million people with type I diabetes would die within weeks of industrial collapse.
906	I think it is only fair that schools provide quality lunches for their students, for three reasons: 1. Because it seems only logical that a public institution that mandates students be there for over seven hours should feed them. 2. To combat obesity. 3. Because not all students can afford to bring quality food to school, have the money to buy it, or have the time to make it in the morning.
907	If a prostitute needs money, it is her choice how she earns it and uses her body. To answer those who say prostitutes are "at the mercy" of their clients: government regulation is even more necessary.
908	I know there's a lot of dislike towards people who post questions or images that have been posted before, but personally, I think it's a good thing that people do that. It's true that the person posting the question could easily search through the previous posts and get an answer, but that deprives all the viewers of seeing an answer if they never thought of that question in the first place. For example, I'm a big fan of /r/askhistorians, but I've never asked a question there. I rely on others thinking of interesting questions I wouldn't have thought about and then reading the answers to them. It works much the same with many other subs. As there's no easy way to view historic posts unless they are "top", unless things are reposted, then there's no way for others who didn't see them the first time to see them again.
909	It is akin to stealing a car and should be illegal. I am willing to allow a private property owner to call a tow truck to remove a car from their property, but only if the police are involved, as they would be when removing atrespasser. In that case, the tow truck should only be permitted to move the car to the nearest available public road or area, and only then should the police decide that the car should be impounded, then and only then should the car be remanded to a police impound lot.
910	I've read some writing about scientific racism, and I don't think that many of their assertions are scientifically valid. Shouldn't there be a study of race differences? People of various origins have various bodies, skeletons, skin color, why shouldn't they have a brain that's different? I don't think any race is superior to another, just like the difference between sexes doesn't make one superior to another. On the flip side, I don't want that kind of study done, because it could be misinterpreted by hateful people and cause a resurgence in racism.
911	While the relic is interesting, it has little historical significance. Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose. Shortly after recovering the Cross, Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan. He thanks Mr. Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection. So we know Dr. Jones doesn't feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing. Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum. CMV.
912	If our species was completely eradicated from Earth, what better tool could aliens have used to gain a better understanding of humankind? Wikipedia isn't 100% reliable, but it provides a general explanation for almost all of human history. No other resource has ever created that provides more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that humanity has ever put together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source. So for the sake of my argument I would like to keep this discussion limited to one single resource.
913	I'm sure we should spend millions on research into creating interesting animal combinations, like a half gorilla, half octopus, with a face that's similar to an octopus, two legs, six wavy arms, and a thick fur. I don't believe the "don't be a god" argument, because I'm not afraid of gods punishing us for creating abominations. Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head roaming around your house. Sure, the research would cost a lot, and some animals might get injured, but I really feel the end result would be worth it.
914	I'm a professional software engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field. Software should never be able to be patented (just copyrighted), including software algorithms. * Most software algorithms aren't secret, like shopping carts or card sorting. * Software algorithms for more complicated stuff (compression algorithms, communication standards, etc.) are also obvious to people in the field. (JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression (DCT, Run-length encoding, etc.) the only thing that should be protected is the end product. * It doesn't give any meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products. * Most meaningful software used is open sourced, what companies pay for is the specialized tailoring that is done to build a custom application; again, your product is protectable by copyright, not patent.
915	By the way, I'm not the one who started this topic. But people who are free from whims and desires are evil, myopic, primitive, afflicted with vices, cannot be trusted, and need to be reined in. No matter how well the Randite arguments sound in theory, 100% pure capitalism won't work. I don't mean socialism, just managed capitalism.
916	I think black people have a worse name because they're in more jails than whites and you don't see them on TV when something bad happens! You mostly see rappers who are black go to jail for stupid things and you nevr see any country singers who are white go anywhere bad! I'm not saying whites aren't bad either cause there are things that happen to them but it's mostly black people! I think all monkeys and krackers should be created equaly, but separately!
917	I think this whole prohibition on smoking in public places is overrated, it should be a matter of decency, that smokers do not smoke when they are around non-smokers, and when they must, they can smoke in the bathroom or something like that.
918	I'd have laughed at Americans eight years ago for letting celebrities influence their votes without verifying the facts, but now I must admit that there's little chance of that happening via regional news outlets, so this might be a good alternative. Do what you're told, America, but by someone slightly smarter than the current one. Apathy's worked well, and TV tells you which burger is the best, so I guess they know which president is the best.
919	I'm not sure it's a waste of time, but it's not worth it either because our world (Earth) has bigger problems like world poverty, population, pollution, and the biggest threat we have...global warming, which will kill 6.5 billion people, maybe even more people right now. Scientists should focus on our world problems first and try to solve them, instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that, and near the end we find out it's impossible, and everyone will die because scientists cared too much about other things when their lives also could be at stake.
920	I don't think it's necessary to filter, but it would be good to have some kind of standardized domain extensions that are specific to some kind of "unsavory" industry. For example, all porn sites should have to use a.xxx extension so that routers can be programmed to block all incoming connections from a.xxx site. This way, parents can block a whole group of sites by blocking a bunch of domain extensions.
921	It's easy, classical music is stagnant, most classical music fans are snobbish, they want to hear exactly how it was played centuries ago. They despise the so-called "neo-classical" Jazz is always evolving, it's an evolving art form, it always adapts to the latest music trends, but still remains Jazz. Jazz can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, R&B, soul, hip hop, world music, folklore et al and it is still Jazz. Yes, they are purists, but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way two times, it is different and fresh every time it is played Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the U.S.A. New Orleans, made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown, Jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity. Jazz is America's greatest cultural export
922	The Supreme Court has made a big deal out of this right, but most people have no idea how important it is. The right to habeas corpus is fundamental to a free society and liberty for all. This decision shows Bush and his administration's utter disregard for what they all promised to do - protect the Constitution.
923	It's not hard, my grandmother was married to 50 years, and it only ended because she died, I've been married seven years, Johnny Cash has been with June Carter for over 40 years, George Takei has been with one man for almost 30 years, and there's nothing more I believe in than love, love for parents, love for siblings, love for my wife, love for my kids, and the love I have for all of them.
924	Test cricket is dying,let's slam it on the head to finish it off and bury it quickly so we don't remember it.
925	Every religion is in the process of spreading its numbers, doesn't matter if they believe in their heart, maybe that's why most terrorists are converted, maybe that's why most people who converted to Christianity are poor, and they're offered a temptation of money. So, is it spreading faith, or counting heads? I think it's counting heads.
926	Terminator, because he's made entirely of metal, and in the movie he said he could live for millions of years, and he can see everything when it's dark. And he's smarter than Rob Cop, because he's just a flimsy human, and he's just a bit of metal, and if he gets shouted at, he'll die instantly, and every time he's hit really badly, he'll die faster, which is why Terminator is so much better, because if he gets shouted at, he won't die at all, and if he loses his arm, he'll still be able to walk really fast.
927	I feel that this stance is in fact weakening the USA. It is time the US Government realized that it is possible to talk to Cuba, Iran, Hamas, as part of a comprehensive foreign policy, and that by closing the door to diplomacy, we are in fact encouraging aggression against the USA.
928	How are you going to enforce this? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask for their license and registration, and perform a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for a breath test, please step out of your vehicle." This will certainly give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of taxpayers. Guess what? If you're drinking and cops don't suspect your drinking habits, it's because your alcohol level is below a DUI. Some cops don't like the extra effort, and paperwork stopping people for DUI. Do you think random testing will solve this problem?
929	I'm sorry about that, but the media is breeding industrial pigs and bigwigs smoking cigars, and they're not informing. Anybody remember the 1976 movie "The Network"? I heard about that, and it's evidence that today's news isn't really news anymore. It's ratings for TV shows, and they have to resort to ridiculous tactics to achieve that.
930	I think doodles should be obligatory for foreign language classes and science classes, I remember better when we were given tasks such as drawing and comics. It helps me concentrate better on what my teachers are saying, simple squiggly lines work best. But I have to admit that when I start to "doodle", my doodles turn into full fledged drawings with shading and color, which is when I get off topic. I should probably figure out how to stop caring too much about visual appeal and just draw and doodle stuff...
931	I'll go with machines, simply because no matter what kind of machines we're talking about, Terminator or "I robot," they're not easy to kill. Zombies, for example, just one shot to the head or removal of the head, and they're done. Additionally, machines can control other machines, such as cars, supercomputers, cell phones, the power supply of the entire city, as well as military weapons, such as jets, tanks, etc. Once they get their hands on these, we'll have a massive war on our hands.
932	It's as unusual as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation, and shouldn't be a part of who we are.
933	It had a good plot, it was a typical revenge story, but it wasn't revealed till the end, it had a nice twist, and it had a moral. If you're going to complain about the sound quality as a reason that the movie isn't good, then you should get off your pompous throne and live in the same way as everyone else.
934	We went there last Friday and the food was great! The F'n Loaded sliders were really good, filet minion with blue cheese and a bottomless basket of garlic fries! The prices were great as well, you get P.F Chang's food without the wallet pain and in my opinion, better food. We'll be back!
935	I've not visited a Sizzler in a long time, but the food and service here was great. For lunch, the salad bar, soups, and ice cream was $6.49. Two bucks more for tacos/hot bar, which looked average. I tried Chicken Rice Gone Wild, which was really good, and French onion soup was decent, but I haven't tried the other two. The salad bar was well stocked, with every vegetable you could possibly need, plus endless slices of avocado, which is a great addition. Also, the waitress will bring you your drinks and bring you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls, or in my case both, and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is really addictive. Most customers speak Spanish, but that's just the area, and the food is really worth the price if you're in the area.
936	I love that you can order half of an appetiser - perfect for when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually bring our dog, sit on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split half of a cheesy crab dip and half of a chicken nachos. The crab dip is incredible, you definitely won't be disappointed. For half an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are! I've been here for lunch and gotten chicken and rice (it's alright, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to imitate),fish tacos (awesome choice),and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner. This is a great choice, and on a nice day, you can't beat that location and view on the patio!
937	The room was clean and modern. The staff was very nice.
938	Don't come here if you don't want security slamming your fiancé. I'm not interested in Tiesto or Calvin Harris playing here. Security should protect their guests, not make it harder or hurt them. My fiancee had a bruise on her arm and screamed for a few days. Way to have a 300lb security guard pushing, shoved, grabbing a 120lb woman in heels, hoped your ego soaring. And by the way, we haven't had a drink yet.
939	The ribeye steak I've ever had was not seasoned at all, and when we asked for medium-well, it was very well done. The service was also not great, and we had to wait a while for our food. Our server forgot to order our kids' food, so they just ate our french fries. We decided to skip the rest of the wait and go somewhere else to eat. At least the place was clean and the kids enjoyed playing outside!
940	We've been to Carpe Diem before, and tonight was our anniversary dinner. Big mistake. The food was awful. Over-seasoned, overdone. Steak was overcooked; Quail was in a bed of black (white) rice and a syrupy sweet sauce. Wine was overpriced. Salad was uninteresting and the dressing was boring. Appetizer meatballs were just regular meatballs without pasta. The descriptions were nice, but the food didn't live up to them. They had our table decorated (for our anniversary), but didn't offer a glass of wine, an appetizer, or dessert for our special occasion. Expensive and, well, "let's just go home and have a glass of wine." kind of night.
941	The service was great, but the food was very expensive and quite bland. The sliders I got were not cooked all the way through and the buns were greasy. I would order fries again, but not again for the sliders.
942	I'd only agree with that at private schools, and that's only because it's voluntary. You know, I think school uniforms are a barrier to free speech and rob youth of individuality.
943	I'm too lazy to explain why, so you can take my word for it.
944	It's not comfortable to sit in a classroom for hours.
945	I'm using firefox now, and it's a little simpler to search on the internet than Internet Explorer.
946	It's even more evidence that Firefox is superior when the only rational argument for IE users is that they're cooler or more attractive.
947	At least Firefox's not a copycat like Internet Explorer 7, which copied Firefox's tabs.
948	No way, that's even better than a prenup :) her: "I'm leaving you and taking half of your crap." me: "Hope you like prison, fuck that!"
949	We're selfish, and we've got a survival mechanism that tells us to do anything for the love of our lives, even if it means taking this terrible secret to our graves.
950	I wouldn't have turned her in if my wife had committed a murder and told me about it, because if you really loved her, then you'd have her back no matter what.
951	I'm not sure I'd confess to them out of love, but I'd definitely not be staying with her, and I'd get as far away from her as I could. For the simple reason that I wouldn't want to get involved in a crime, because I knew about it.
952	India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires, they couldn't even lead themselves.
953	No, rags are used to clean toilets, not headscarves, last time I checked.
954	They're not even capable of organizing their streets, they take a bath in the same river where they bury their dead and defecate, the Ganges. They're extremely poor, they can't even look after their own budget, let alone the planet.
955	It's going to sound terrible but I don't wanna think of my dad as a bad one. I love my daddy but it's not the same when you have a bad dad who just makes you have problems. You don't need a dad, you can talk to somebody else. Maybe it's just because I'm a girl, it's easier for me to talk to my mom.
956	Being fatherless is a challenge, but it's the only way to be strong and dependent on yourself. Being fatherless is difficult, but it's the best thing you can do. If you have a bad father, you learn the wrong things and you can't grow.
957	Farquhar's got a boss, he's got to follow the raffles, and he's not doing anything else, so why can't he help Singapore when he was fired? I'm saying again, you need to be in a certain spot to be a founder, because your time, money, effort are all invested, and you need to know people who can help you.
958	Raffles was the one who stopped the Dutch from taking Singapore, the Dutch were angry that Britain would take it, but Raffles stopped them.
959	Is porn good for you?No, it's not. Opponents say it doesn't have any serious health effects, but studies have shown that regular porn and its practice can harm your body slowly, especially your immune system. Sooner or later, people who engage in regular porn in their relationships will not be as healthy as other people. This is the key question: smoking is bad for you, and so is porn. In fact, smoking is better than porn in terms of health, because both of them are extremely bad for you.
960	Firefox is bloated now, it uses way more memory. When everybody buys a new PC and gets IE7, they'll have no excuse to switch to Firefox.
961	The title and address of the page appear in the tooltip of IE7 tabs, while Firefox 2.0 displays only the title.
962	It's easier to use IE, it's more visually pleasant, and it's safer.
963	People think physical education is completely useless, because normally you just run around a field for an hour. But there's something else going on in physical education, than just being able to build muscle and get stronger, and not get fat so easily (although you would need to eat well, of course). And for older people, like 60 or 80, it could prevent heart attacks. With this kind of training, there would be fewer overweight kids in the world, and more fit and strong people.
964	It should be obligatory, because active participation in sports, including physical education, contributes to children developing good habits in later life, and also because they get the advantage of working as a team, which is not always the case in other classes.
965	You're 100% correct, because I'm at PE and they make us wear these stupid outfits, I guess to let the gay coaches see our private parts, and PE's just stupid.
966	William Farquhar had been dismissed, and although he had made many good achievements during the early days of Singapore's development, he had taken measures in his administration that were in contradiction with Raffles' instructions, so many people had simply ignored Farquhar's efforts and attributed them to Raffles.
967	When Farquar was dismissed by Raffles, there was a larger ceremony before he left, compared to Raffles, which demonstrated the extent to which people adored him.
968	The people recognized William Farquhar as the founder, because he had been there to solve their problems when Raffles had not been there, and he had even taken money from his own pocket to solve some of them. When William Farquhar had to leave, the people sent him off with sadness in their hearts.
969	While I personally do not think abortion is right, I do not think the government has the right to decide that. That decision should be made by the parents of the unborn child, not by the government.
970	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is crap, which is why these debates are useless. You've got some stupid creationists who don't know anything about science. sabrejimmy hasn't tried to learn anything from this debate, and he's still asking ridiculous questions. Personally, I think I'm going to ignore his next posts. Smart debate is satisfying, but this isn't.
971	I call the god of the gap the god of the gap because early man's understanding of the universe was so limited that he didn't know earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates moving, so the idea that earthquakes were caused by an angry god seemed logical, but now that man's understanding of the universe has grown, he knows that current species are the result of billions of years of evolution, so he must accept facts and let religion go.
972	Evolution is real, and it's documented, and it's being studied. I'd like you to look at this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and let your mind wander.
973	No, porn isn't bad. It's an abstract term, so it can't be bad.
974	Everyone has a sexual desire, but sometimes you're not in the mood for sex, and you just wanna have a good time. Pornography helps with that.
975	The issue is, who's the right to prohibit it? Government? Why does the state need to prohibit pornography at all? Look at Europe, they're okay with pretty much everything. I don't see any moral depravity there, do you?
976	Porn isn't always bad taste, but when it's providing equal pleasure, etc. for both parties, it's fine, and in some ways, it could be considered an art form.
977	It's much better to serve the common good, which we have learnt from the very beginning by our parents and teachers. Community service is all about serving the common good, which means that we must assist others for our own good.
978	As fashion and trends change, students are more interested in how they look, how they are perceived than in their academic success and achievements. The fashion for low-rise jeans, baggy jeans, big trench coats, low-cut shirts, and so on is contributing to behavior problems and safety issues in classrooms and school corridors today.
979	I like the idea of school uniforms, first of all, they make students look nice and tidy, secondly, we can see who's studying at what school, or who's studying at the same school as us, and lastly, it's convenient because we don't need to spend a lot of time choosing clothes for school.
980	I'd say it's a good thing you have a bad father than no father, because at least you know who your dad is and where he is. You'll get a little idea of what your self will be when you grow up. If he's a bad father, it'll make you want to be better than he is, in fact, that should make you want to be the best father you can be.
981	I'd pick a bad father, because I think it's better to have one than none. A dad is very important in a child's life, he keeps things stable all the time. My dad isn't very good, but he's supportive and helps out sometimes. I'd rather have one than none.
982	Yeah, I've got a water bottle next to me, it's not a deal!
983	Plastic bottles should only be used in emergencies, whether natural or human caused, to provide water to people in need, not harm the environment or habitats by being dumped into the ocean or landfills.
984	TV, because you're able to get information quickly from various sources, while books require a lot of reading to get that much information!
985	They can be recycled to make other things, such as more water bottles. That makes the water company wealthy. They're not expensive, like $3 for one of those big boxes at Shaw's, which will make you thirsty for a few weeks.
986	Ban on bottled water would harm the economy, because it would result in hundreds of jobs lost and major corporations, such as Dasani and Nestle, losing millions of dollars. This would harm the economy very badly. Millions of Americans use and buy water bottles every day, so banning them would only harm major corporations. http://www.nestlewaterscorporate.com/bottled_water_things_to_know
987	God created water bottles for a reason, because they're good.
988	All day, every day, guys, without them we'd be able to comfortably go around the block carrying safe water in our hands.
989	I like this web site, but it's not very clear to me. This one is better: theworlddebating.com
990	Here's a reason why a gay marriage might be bad. If it's okay for a gay marriage, then it's okay for a sister and a brother to marry. What's the difference? Oh, look, it's the genders that make the difference, so SISTER and SISTER or BIRTH and BIRTH are fine, aren't they?
991	India is clearly capable of leading the world.........Dr Manmohan Singh is considered to be the best prime minister in the world.........India has shown its potential in different areas and aspects.........
992	I'd like to point out how little conflict there is in the Christian world, because we don't have to persuade others, we know that there is no God, and that life is all about us making it.
993	For reasons that should be entirely obvious, and I assume the others involved have already thoroughly explained.
994	First of all, being hit helps you get stronger and grow up, secondly, it makes you listen. It's not abuse, it's spanking.
995	It's not to be used constantly, but it should be used to transmit the message to the child.
996	I'm sorry our religion isn't recognized, and I'm sorry Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. But since I'm a theist, I have to side with them.
997	Spanking should not be used as a method of disciplining a child because the child may end up being traumatized, feeling unloved because they were spanked a lot, which would lead to a low self-esteem. Also, spanking should not be used because the parent would be in a state of rage, and they would not be able to think rationally.
998	Children shouldn't be spanked because they're supposed to be treated equally, I wouldn't want my kid hitting me.
999	As an ambitious, youngster who wants to become a legitimate, successful, homicide detective, I would not have been lenient to any murderer in my midst. I hope that this murder wasn't a pleasure killing, so the punishment wouldn't have been so severe, but nevertheless, all murderers must be tried. Hopefully, my spouse will understand that living in hiding is the same as being in jail, except much worse, since they have a very small chance of parole since they must live with guilt and/or fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1000	Who knows if they'll turn on you, and then one night when you least expect it, they'll try to kill you, because they think you know the truth, and the truth won't come out, and they have to get rid of all kinds of evidence, even of those they love, just in case they talk to somebody.
1001	I don't want to sound facetious, but you're saying we should look to the government for help in our belief system. Have you ever read T. Hobbes?
1002	I think abortion is wrong, but necessary, when a mother can't have the child and if trying to do it will kill her.
1003	I'm not seeing the difference between killing an embroyo and a 40-year-old man.
1004	I'd like to ask you one question: why do we argue for the "right" to kill an unborn child when the government is robbing us of our real rights?
1005	"The Champion," this isn't about a woman's body, this is about a new life, and if you're going to act irresponsibly, don't let that new life die for you!"
1006	In addition, only a few people in their lives engage in physical activity!
1007	The job of a physical education teacher is pretty easy, they don't have to learn anything, just yell at the kids for an hour.
1008	The gym class is a waste of time for students who should be testing themselves, and people who can't run a mile without stopping every few feet should be joining.
1009	Gay marriage isn't bad for anybody, gay marriage isn't killing a lot of people, gay marriage isn't going to destroy the world, gay marriage isn't anything to worry about except for the two people who marry.
1010	You can't just pick someone's lifestyle because you don't like it, and call it a "choice" when you're not that person, and you know that being gay isn't a choice.
1011	It's better to pursue personal goals, because people are human and want to be the best they can be, and they want to be at the top. I know I want to be a "winner", which, in turn, means that someone must lose. That's personal.
1012	I think it's more important to pursue personal goals, because before you can help others, you need to help yourself. It's not a bad thing to wish to help the greater good, but if you always put other people before yourself, you might forget about your needs and desires in life. But I think it's possible to achieve a balance between them.
1013	I think personal happiness is better, because you have to be happy first, before you go into the world and try to make everybody else happy. If you're always trying to make everybody else happy, and you don't have time for yourself, then you're a loser, and you won't be happy.
1014	Of course everybody wants to say they'll help humanity, the world, save town, but only a tiny percentage would actually do it. I honestly wish I could help humanity, save the world, but I'm posting under personal interest because I don't know what I would do in such a situation. Anyway, if people believed in the betterment of society, all the economical cars and factories wouldn't be built just now, they would have been invented as soon as the theory of global warming was established.
1015	I'm saying that personal goals are better, because they're more about you than other people, and if you can't focus on yourself, then how are you going to focus on or help the people around you? I'm not saying that pursuing a common good is bad, I'm just saying that it's better to focus on yourself.
1016	In all honesty, I think that both are good, there's no better argument, because they're both important and balance each other out. Personal interest, because you improve yourself for others and the environment around you, and then you improve the common good, because the goods make you and others better. Life isn't perfect, and we don't live in a perfect world, and I don't expect it to be. These two aren't different, but they are important.
1017	There are many reasons, but the main one is that girls are looking for fun with guys in the wrong places, like bars, discos, or late-night parties, because guys are easily substituting alcohol with drugs, because the media portrays "fun" for young people as"having sex", and it's not cool to be without it, because girls don't think their safety is a priority anymore, and if their parents warn them, they react by going all out with guys, giving them the opportunity they are looking for, because their "safety antenna" isn't as sensitive as it should be, so they end up becoming a victim, and thus, date rape is a consequence of all these things.
1018	I'm not sure what this woman wanted from recording this conversation except more drama. Some people are addicted to drama and they're doing all they can to create it. Get out of the way of these people, they'll drain you.
1019	No, they're not required to, however, it might damage your credibility, so you can just sign an affirmation instead. I'm not "believer" in any religion, nor am I going to swear an oath to any state or government. Lots of legal documents require a notary's seal, I refuse that oath, so instead I just sign an affirmation, which is fine and completely legal.
1020	I think the executor of the estate is supposed to divide the remains equally, so that when you sell something, you get the same share. If they sell it, it doesn't matter how much they've already spent, they still owe you. It's a shame people act so selfishly and unethical when their parents die.
1021	The aim of punishment is to reform the criminal, but in some cases the criminal has gone beyond the process of reformation and is enjoying his criminal activity, for example serial killers, psychopaths, and in other cases the criminal has committed such a heinous crime that the conscience of an ordinary person is shaken, and capital punishment is needed to prevent others from doing similar acts. Furthermore, the Law Commission has recommended in its various reports that capital punishment should not be banned, particularly in the Indian system.
1022	While driving, a person needs to pay full attention, and using a cell phone takes your mind off the road, and it's better to have two hands on the wheel. Please don't use your cell phone while driving, even if it's legal in your state. It's always good to be an example. I've had my share of drivers who didn't pay attention because they were on their cell phone.
1023	First of all, this case isn't about ACLU, they're generally only interested in cases where the government is violating civil liberties. Second of all, where's your source on this case? You've got some details, so I'm sure you've got a newspaper article or some link with more information. Third of all, the answer to your question is "no."
1024	Isn't it the NY Times? It's just that they're the paper that Bush's administration is trying to attack, while the government has its own web site and magazine dedicated to this very issue, not to mention all the other media organizations that ran the same story! What a ruse! Since September 11, Bush himself has given more than a dozen public statements mentioning how they disrupt "terrorist" funding! Just another disgusting Bush administration tactic to distort and distract!
1025	I don't remember hearing of any valid case of marijuana use leading to violence, much less a killing spree. Regardless of what government services are provided for those who are ill, it shouldn't have the right to totally ban the use of certain substances, especially when those substances are less harmful than the ones that are legal! Wake up! NEWSFLASH: You can die by drinking too much water! Just because you'll get help from a hospital or whatever doesn't mean they should ban water. Where is your logic, guys? Also to those who complain about it being a gateway drug: If it wasn't illegal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug. It's only made bad by the government's efforts and the gullible people who believe them.
1026	You're probably scared that if you die, he'll have rights to the baby. To do otherwise would mean that he won't be liable for child support. Check with your local social services office to see if they can still collect child support if he waives his rights to the baby.
1027	Even though the sentence itself was ridiculous? I've spent years trying to get a woman out of prison for possession of 2/3 of a gram, and although she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me great pain, I still don't think it was right to keep her in prison for so long.
1028	Isn't unemployment insurance right for you? If you're not, then you're in trouble and in most states it's a felony. I'd try and sort this out before they come after you. They'll notice and catch on. Today, in most states, employers have to report new employees to the state for child support reasons. This is one way they'll catch you. Another is with your taxes. When you file your taxes, they'll notice the W-2s that you and your husband both filled out.
1029	I'm not sure you're getting the idea that they're making a fortune off of child placement. It costs the state money. My sister works in that field, and the department is severely underfunded and understaffed. The workers are doing their best, but sadly, the situation will not improve until more people tell their local officials that they want the money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and road expansion. My sister alone has about 50 cases and she has to visit foster homes, parents, supervise at least 1 visit a month, and attend court monthly for each of them. There aren't enough hours in a day. Each case worker should only have about 20 cases, but they don't have the funding to hire enough people. I hope your situation improves.
1030	I'm not sure I understand your argument, but in general, I would say morality and law are like a Venn diagram, where an act can be either or neither. Which wouldn't be good, actually, because that's what makes the saying "you can't legislate morality" so popular.
1031	Maybe your lawyer is just a general practitioner lawyer who's worked on many different types of cases, or he's a fool, worst case scenario, he's trying to save his right to say he wasn't properly represented by beating him up in court.
1032	I'm not an American, I'm a Canadian, and I pride myself on that fact. There are things about the U.S. that I admire and envy, and there are things about the U.S. that I don't like or respect. The war in Iraq is one of those things, I think it's a terrible mistake to go in and do what they did, and the civilian casualties are such an insult.
1033	If you're from Michigan, they'll take away your driver's license if you drink and drive.
1034	I understand the need to avoid criminal threats or attempts to intimidate, but other than that, I think you should be free to speak your mind.
1035	It depends on what you want and what impression you want to give. If you want to show that you're a good citizen who should be forgiven, then I would choose none of the above and go for something more traditional. If you don't care about the impression you give, then obviously Birks.
1036	Civil rights: we're innocent until proven guilty, and having everyone in a database would be a completely contradictory position, like "you're a criminal waiting to be discovered", terrible! It could even have the opposite effect, like "they think I'm already a criminal, so I don't have to commit crimes anymore". But the biometric card will be similar to the system you're proposing, and we'll see if crime rates go down.
1037	I believe people who are sent to prison for drug abuse should be sent to treatment centers, not for selling drugs. Drug dealers should be sent to jail, but the punishment should be proportionate to the crime. If an addict commits crimes to feed his habit, jail time for the crime, followed by treatment for the addiction. As for murderers and rapists, I believe the punishment should be more severe, and capital punishment should be carried out better than it is currently. 30 years of appeals and legal system for capital murder is too long to wait for justice.
1038	It's not legal because the government can't regulate it, because it's generally considered a gateway drug, leading to more dangerous drugs, and because, unlike some European countries, where it's legal, legalizing it would cause a huge initial interest in it, which would lead to higher health care costs, because smoking marijuana damages respiratory systems and makes you less able to judge, and because legalizing it would make all the drug dealers who sell weed have to find something else to do, and my guess is it wouldn't be a legitimate job, so it would cause a rise in crime, probably gun sales, or an increase in illegal narcotics.
1039	What are you talking about, sex with minors, or minors having sex with each other? If it's a pretty lady and a male underage, then it's okay. If it's a man and a girl underage, then it's wrong. If it's two underage girls together, then the laws should be less strict than they are now. A good example would be if a good teacher went to jail for having sex with one of her students, and that was for something, like making him the happiest guy in the world?
1040	If you and your mom are in order, then I don't see a reason why you shouldn't go on your own! Check the local laws and statutes in your city. Usually 18 is the age of maturity, but there are exceptions to that rule in certain areas. If you live with a relative and are "underage", then a guardianship contract would need to be amended by both parties, your parents and the live-in relatives or adult head of household. But I don't think that will be an issue for you, or anyone else, anywhere! I say, just pack your bags, and with your mom's blessing, go off and find your destiny, my child! Have fun and stay out of trouble, okay?
1041	Since the stem cells are abundant in the blood that remains in the umbilical cord after delivery, there is no moral need to trade off... I support the harvesting of stem cells from donated cord blood and do not see any reason at all why embryonic cells are needed at all in order to do the research that holds such incredible promise.
1042	I think it's a joke that murder is punishable by murder, and I'm sure many people on death row think the same thing. Fortunately, in my country we haven't had the death penalty for a long time, so killers have to live with their nightmares for ever, rather than get an easy way out. We should be promoting modern liberal western values to the world, but it's not so great that the West's leading nation itself can't live up to those ideals.
1043	I don't know if this is a question or a criticism of America, I often ask myself that same question. The most sincere answer might be because we control our technology and we are able to control its spread, because we see it as a threat. In general, it's probably not a good idea that every Tom, Dick, and Harry should have an atomic bomb. Do you really think that nothing bad would happen if every country had enough bombs to destroy the planet? Yeah, that would be great. I have to admit there's an irony in the US being so controlling with nuclear weapons. We say we can't trust others to have them, but who's the only country insane enough in the world to actually use one?
1044	You'll be fine if you have the training and the education, but be aware that the people you'll be dealing with live in a different reality than we do. They live by the law of the jungle, the strong survive and the strong rule. I'm a tall, strong cop, and rarely have a suspect fought with me. They tell me my size makes them hesitate to fight. If you're smaller, then you might have to fight more. Also, keep in mind that most of the time you'll be carrying one or more backup cops with you. Citizens who see us making arrests in three or more layers don't realize that we bring a lot of cops out to avoid fights. We know their natures. Now, all of the smaller cops I've ever known are perfectly capable of doing this job. Just be aware of what you're getting into.
1045	I know it's a cliché, but it's not insulting to you. India isn't poor, it's rich in history, everything. If you think it's poor, it stays poor, but if you can write better English, more people will get jobs, and lo and behold, India will become rich!
1046	If you listen closely, they say "you have the right to remain silent." It's just that they don't have to say anything. And when you are questioned, you aren't always a criminal, remember you have to be proven guilty, but you're first innocent. At the time they are questioning them, also I'm sure if a suspect didn't want to talk, but was forced to, he'd make up a lot of junk and waste the cops time anyways.
1047	I also think that hunger is a mitigating circumstance in cases of food theft, if it isn't, it should be.
1048	No, you're using equipment that you've been provided with as an employee, and the school is entitled to ensure that it's not being used illegally. If you don't like the terms of the agreement you sign to use school computers for email, then you should simply stop using them. They're also going to monitor the websites you or any of your students visit.
1049	It's because we don't learn respect for alcohol at a young age, and if we had treated it more like Europeans, it wouldn't have been such a taboo. So many teenagers drink till they're sick and behave like fools. And those stupid commercials that link drinking beer to being sexy, because you're not sexy when you're drunk.
1050	I'd say 18 years old, that's still young, but I think you should have finished your High School and lived under your parents' law for a long time, as you say, you can fight wars and vote, that's a big responsibility, and when you're old enough to die and old enough to vote, then I think the legal age should be 18.
1051	No, he's already out of his mind in California, and we have a president who's not really up for the presidency, and I'm not going to repeat that. And I think this is where the president of his country should be born, and any other job can go to anyone with a legal status, but not the presidency.
1052	I'm not worried about "competition" - aside from the fact that my husband's doing well, most of the girls I've seen aren't "very beautiful" - they're drug addicts, skanks who gave up trying to be anything when they realized that they could make money from their sex. Personally, I think legalizing it would remove a lot of mystery and corruption from the whole thing. Also, in most places where it's legal, they're tested regularly for diseases, which obviously solves a major problem.
1053	I think this is a good idea, among other benefits: * The state's hands stay clean. * An innocent man will always choose life in prison, and during that time new evidence will come to light that will prove him innocent. No more dead innocents. * The convicts freedom of choice will be preserved, which is important. * If they choose life in prison, they should be offered the choice again every five years or so, so that life in prison is not inhumane, and there is always a way out. * The method of suicide should be left to the convict, and no one else needs to bear the burden of ending someone's life.
1054	We're born, we live, we die. These are constants in our lives, we know they'll come to pass, so why should I do a job I don't like, or bother to maintain relationships? I'm in a transitional period of my life, dealing with social strife isn't worth it, I should just go back to my place of work and spend my days curled up with cats or something.
1055	"Just be yourself" is a bad attitude, it hurts the person who has it, and everyone around them, because they use it as an excuse to do all kinds of stupid things and not improve. We, as a civilization, have progressed so much by striving for the better, striving for perfection, and doing everything we could to make the lives of our progeny the best we could. People glorify all kinds of objectively bad things (morbid obesity, being a jerk to other people, ana/mia, heavy drug addiction), under the pretext of "that's who I am, and you don't have a right to judge me."
1056	I'm looking for evidence that there's been progress, or that aggressiveness pays off, when I opened the door to a girl today.
1057	You can't control where you're from or what your skin color is, so it seems silly to me to root for someone just because of where they are from and not how they play.
1058	It is becoming increasingly apparent that the country is not working for the betterment of its inhabitants and I do not see it moving in any direction that will ever reach a balance that will satisfy its citizens. The culture there is simply going in the wrong direction of idolatry and total submission, and people are becoming increasingly programmed to accept that over generations. People work and are barely able to sustain themselves. I believe the two countries should be unified and the South Korean system should be accepted. This is difficult to state from a pinko communist, but I think this would be a better outcome than continuing the way it is going. How this is going to happen is not really a concern of the topic posted.
1059	I'm not saying that I don't support the sentiment, and I think this is a truly disgusting situation, but this doesn't make sense. It paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror, in my opinion, by fuelling the fire of the terrorists without having any real force to change anything. There will always be smug campaigns that are more about feeling better from doing some armchair activism than real will to change, but I think that a lot of people will feel that this particular campaign has a lot of merit, so that it keeps it in the social conscience. I just don't think it'll work this time, for the reasons above.
1060	I'd like to see research on shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general. It would disintegrate before it got to the sun, maybe once or twice a year, where we'd be certain it landed, or maybe we should just fire it into the big emptyness of space. Scale-wise, it's highly unlikely that within several hundred years it would ever hit anything. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earth's escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldn't burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1061	I know that science has made it possible for people to have children, but I think it's selfishness to spend more than $3000 on a surrogate that doesn't make sense. Also, the most successful surrogate agencies are in foreign countries where they abuse women physically because they can pay them so little to use their bodies. Childbirth is physically demanding for a woman, so knowing that she went through all that just to give birth to a child she'll never see again isn't right.
1062	Polyamory has been a hot topic in the media lately, and I've been reading the comments on these articles, which aren't exactly positive, with most people just making "Nope" or "Ick" type comments. I'm in a polyamorous relationship with two guys, so I'm interested in this fight. We live together, they don't have sex, and we're happy, healthy, stable, and long term. What's wrong with my relationship? And, of course, I know it's not for everybody, but that's not an argument in itself.
1063	I know this sounds really grim, but all my grandparents were born somewhere between the end of the 1920's and the end of the 1930's and according to most of what I've heard marriage was just "something they did". Society, for some reason, just expected them to get married young and have lots of kids.
1064	I personally feel that the amount of money they're paid is too much. Now, I'm not trying to say this is unfair because I don't get paid enough at my job. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a decent salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it. This may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.
1065	I am partly inspired by the recent "new look" for Ronald McDonald, which was revealed on Twitter. I think companies using cartoon or clown characters to market their products to children are unethical, because they are making an early connection in the minds of impressionable young people to the idea that these products are enjoyable and safe. When these people grow up, that connection is irreversible, and they still consume these products because of their childhood nostalgia.
1066	I'm from Australia and I'm a big fan of all sports, but I just don't understand the huge following for baseball and American football. I've tried to watch the whole game, but I just can't get over how slow and how action-packed both of them are. I feel like I'm missing out on something, or not appreciating them enough, and if I knew more about the hidden aspects, I'd enjoy them more. Are these sports really that exciting, or are they just so ingrained in American culture that their attractiveness and appeal are an afterthought? Please change my mind, as I would love to be involved.
1067	I never tip, I think it's a way of letting employers know that they can get away with paying a substandard wage to people based on their chosen occupation, I think tipping should be banned and in its place employers should be legally obliged to pay a realistic and viable wage, then if people choose to tip, that should go directly to the server. I've never understood why employers are allowed to pay 2$ an hour and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage, and I don't feel anyone should be guilted into paying X% on top of the bill at a restaurant to pay the servers wage when it should be their employers.
1068	Look at Florida's major metropolitan areas, which are leaders in technology, business, and pleasure. I've lived here my entire life, and even though we've had a beating economically, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep moving away from here, because it's just a waiting room for God. Too many sticklers in the mire. Tourism is a major driver of the economy, but it shouldn't be the only one. For Pete's sake, change my mind before 2015. It could be my opportunity to move to Tampa Bay, if I can afford it.
1069	I'm not saying we shouldn't theorize about potential catastrophe, but I think the current fear is overblown CMV.
1070	In the last decade, America's police have become increasingly aggressive and ruthless in their use of power. Every day, we hear about cops shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens, and animals, and they're usually slapped with a warning or given a paid leave. I understand that they serve a crucial role in our society, but it's clear that they're abusing that trust. In many places they tried to install personal cameras that have been proven to reduce incidents and false accusations, yet police departments are adamant against their implementation. This leads me to believe that they're trying to cover up crime and widespread systemic abuse.
1071	I'm sure some of the design choices are understandable, but we've learned over the past 40 years what a general purpose gaming controller should look like. Two thumbsticks, four buttons on the right side, an 8-way directional pad on the left side, two bumper buttons, and two triggers. Why is Microsoft and Sony's placement of the directional pad and the left stick different when the controllers are functionally identical? I think there's a better design, which one I don't think is relevant, and one of the companies just can't move because of stubbornness.
1072	I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
1073	I admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head win. That said, sports are played to be won, not to have many points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored are almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).
1074	The workers in China, even if they're getting pennies, clearly need the cash. My understanding, which I admit is limited, is that unless the government makes active efforts to alleviate poverty, outsourcing American projects to China is necessary for the families/people of China to survive. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can't afford to eat, pay rent, or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was eliminated, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the edge of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would once again have the same problem as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard work, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have.
1075	* No one should be taking a drug that they do not understand the effects of, and removing the stigmatisation of drugs is the first step to educating people about them. * No one should be judged differently from a drinker because they prefer LSD or MDMA, and comparing them to smoking is a bad habit. * No one should be afraid to seek help for dependency, and knowing what they are taking. * No one should be able to buy government approved, pure drugs and know what they are taking. * No one should think that prohibition is the answer.
1076	In the context of the recent Indian election, where Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi won with a landslide, I cannot see any good in Narendra Modi for the long run. While he may have had a good economic record in Gujarat, he will destroy the religious tolerance that India is famous for. It would be better to keep Congress, which, although it is as corrupt as all hell, is not responsible for the massacre of Muslim pilgrims in 2002 in Gujarat, where up to 2000 Muslim pilgrims were massacred and Modi was accused of complicity). Apart from that specific incident, is it better to be tolerant and corrupt or effective and intolerant?
1077	I think that might be one reason. Also, our media doesn't show all the real horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc., and all the thousands of other grotesque details that can't be translated very well into media forms, like mental anguish, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.
1078	I'm not the one who started this thread, but I would support legalizing marijuana as long as it remains illegal to sell or advertise it to minors and that it isn't used while driving or operating heavy machinery. There are many benefits to legalizing marijuana: 1) People who are arrested for marijuana use would get another chance to get back on their feet. 2) Taxpayers will pay less for the maintenance of the prison system. 3) Federal and state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are taxed. Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces supply, but does not reduce demand. As a result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in illegally selling it illegally on the black market. I know people are doing the right thing by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs), but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.
1079	Yes, it's safer than alcohol, it's almost impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal, it would be easier to regulate. A good example would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (like they did with weed), and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasys, which they did with weed houses, that they could have used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who stole the last donut. When prohibition was lifted, organization returned to society.
1080	There's really no debate going on here, but nobody checks the forums and I want this to get some attention. This site has become a stagnant waste. There's almost no intellectual stimulation anymore. The lack of quality debates is almost smothered by the lack of general participation. It's been weeks since I learned anything or read anything worthwhile here, and that really needs to change. So I'm going to make an effort to have a plethora of debates (about 5 per week), starting with W.U.C (Wake Up Convinceme), covering a range of political, social, and moral issues that I feel are stimulating and not discussed enough to bring this site back. Wake Up Convinceme!
1081	This debate isn't about whether kids should eat candy, it's about whether governments should ban advertising to kids that makes candy eating look good. It's legal for kids to eat candy, so why should it be illegal for people to say that kids should eat candy? In addition, kids naturally love candy, and the ads only persuade them to choose one brand over another, not to start eating candy. This should be an easy decision for anyone who says they value freedom.
1082	In 1932, Hitler invaded Poland, and the world turned against Germany. In fact, over the past 100 years, there have been dozens of instances where nations have invaded other nations, causing uproar and rising against them. And yet, some stupid Texan is doing this, and he's getting away with it.
1083	Truth be told, truth is different for everybody. My truth is that when I flush the toilet, water flows counter-clockwise. But someone from Brazil's truth is that it flows clockwise. So who's right? Well, in a sense, we're both right. Or should I just say the usual Christian answer, Jesus is the truth, The Way, the Truth, and Life.
1084	In the NFL, it's safe to say that not all positions are equal. Kickers don't get paid as much as running backs, and running backs aren't paid as much as quarterbacks. So, quarterbacks get paid more because their decisions affect the team more than any other position on the team.
1085	I'm glad he's taking the hits in relation to the oil spill, and he's aware that Sestak is going to have to be resolved, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took $77,000 from BP, and he's saying that corruption between politics and oil companies is the problem, but this cozy relationship was established long before he came to power, and this problem existed before Carter came to power, so it's irresponsible for him to keep accusing Bush of being responsible for it.
1086	First of all, let me define what wrestling should be: wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two unarmed persons, in which each wrestler strives to gain an advantage over or control over the other. Is that what we see on TV? No! The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on TV today. Many persons can testify that they see men and women using chairs, bats, etc. as weapons, which means that they are harmed! The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, I can remember clearly the 'UNDERTAKER' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a horrible sight!...
1087	We're all aware that guys want to impress their friends and show off that they have some, then they'll leave the girl after they've had sex and go on with somebody else, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc
1088	It is essential that society function properly and that people can't afford the price of education, which will lead to consequences such as the collapse of many children's futures. Education is the means of attaining goals and success; what right does anyone have to deny education to someone simply because they can't provide the funds needed?
1089	Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Until heaven and earth pass, no jot or tittle shall in any wise pass from the law, until all is fulfilled." Unless I'm mistaken, Heaven and Earth are still existing, and not all the prophecies listed in the Bible have happened. I open with these words from Yahushua himself, and take him at his word, as he is no liar. I realize my post is not in the form of a question, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed...The Torah/Law is forever!
1090	In the long run, this is good for the economy. China keeps its currency low so that it can continue to provide really cheap products to America. But when the dollar is too low, Chinese products will be more expensive, which will hurt American consumers in the short run, but will ultimately strengthen the domestic market for American producers.
1091	I went to this place on my last night in Montreal. It was very popular, and on this particular night, it was full to the brim. The prices were tricky, as sometimes the things you order and receive don't appear, but you get a fixed bill. It would have been nice to see them separately, but since it's unlimited, that's all you get. Also, this night, there were many wrong orders. Things that one table ordered were delivered to another, and vice versa. The sushi was great, but I felt like they charged us more than we should have.
1092	The new place is amazing, and the food is even better than we thought it could be. We had rib and brisket tacos, which were amazing, as well as slaw and black beans which were very fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend calling ahead to make a reservation, because it's very popular.
1093	We had a really great lunch at Zeta's and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be going back.
1094	I'm not sure why this place has such bad reviews. The food, drinks, and atmosphere were great. The service was a bit slow, but that's okay with me. I didn't feel rushed to get out of there.
1095	I went there on 10/20/2013 around 6:15pm with a group of 6. We ordered hummus as an appetiser and potato pizza, Lobster Gnocchi, roasted chicken and burgers. By the end of the night, 3 of us had diarrhea, some of us felt like throwing up, 1 had acid reflex and a lot of gas which disturbed the whole night, 2 others had gas problems. I don't know what was going on with the food that night but I won't be back.
1096	There aren't many wine bars in Mesa, and D'Vine is a great place to stay local. It's just around the corner from me, and it saves me driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale. The food is always great, and the staff is always nice. It's a great atmosphere, and the live music is great so far. Only thing I would change is that on the weekends they stay open a bit later, like 11pm.
1097	I'm so in love with this place, we go there every time we see each other and wonder why we haven't been back sooner. It's not flashy, but the food is always great. Chicken, beef, rice, beans, plants. It's just so good. My only disappointment was that when I tried dessert, I had what I thought was a tres leches cake, and it didn't taste like I thought it would. Maybe I'm just used to an oversugared American version of it.
1098	I've wasted my time, money, and precious calories here. I would rather go to McDonald's and have the same experience, if not better. Now, I'm just enjoying a fresh bowl of salad, thanks to the extra calories that I sacrificed for nothing. Boo!!! It's amazing that this place still gets such high ratings.
1099	I'm sorry for those of you on the other side, IE has so many annoying pop-ups and viruses, yet you still use it?! My favorite feature of Firefox is the tabs feature, IE needs you to start a new browser to search two websites at once, which is pointless. :/ Plus, Firefox saves the last website you were on when you restart your computer. Yeah, I don't know, it has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
1100	I'm sure FireFox is the best, because I've got it. The only reason people use Internet Explorer is because it's the default browser on most computers. I'm betting 90% of IE fans only know one browser.
1101	I'm sure he made a big mistake and should have to pay for it, but I don't think I'd be able to turn in my husband, who I love. We need to protect each other and stand by each other no matter what. Even if it makes me an accomplice.
1102	I'm not sure I'd be able to turn in my husband, family, or friends if they killed someone, because they're all too close. I can't imagine living without them. Why would anyone send away someone they love? It's bad, especially if you live with him.
1103	I'd say books are better because they require imagination, and the more you read, the better your imagination gets, and it improves your reading, grammar, and your writing skills! Also, I hate commercials. I hate Spongebob! I would say PBS Kids, History Channel, and other channels that help kids or adults become smarter!
1104	Books even lower our electricity bill, which is a big part of our spending money!
1105	Books make you smarter, they're also able to tell what people are thinking.
1106	It's absolutely stupid to say people who can't read will always run away from them, but it's B for books and B is the best, so books are the best. I can't sleep if I don't read a chapter of a novel every day, but sometimes I feel reading books all day is becoming boring, so I only watch TV and those two news channels, so by reading books I can pass time, and even improve my speaking skills.
1107	We can only say "if", because we're not 100% sure that India will lead the world. There are still other countries that are more advanced, more educated, more powerful than India, like America, UK, Russia, Japan, etc. India doesn't have the potential and ability to meet its people's needs yet. India isn't as technologically advanced as America is, and in fact, technology is one of the most sophisticated and necessary inventions ever created.
1108	I don't know this very well, but in my opinion, the answer is "fatherless", because I wouldn't have a man in my life who wasn't interested in your life at all. It's more like being fatherless to me.
1109	A father is someone who's always there for you, who teaches you how to play baseball, and attends all your games. A father is someone who shields you from all evil in the world, but if your dad is someone who doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you believe he'll protect you? A bad father is someone you can't believe in. I'd rather have no father than a dad I can't believe in my life.
1110	I'm just saying, it's better to be fatherless than have a bad father. I mean, I was taught that a real man should be respectable, honest, and hard-working, and if he's not that, then he doesn't deserve to be father in the first place. Besides, just because you don't have a father doesn't mean you can't have a father figure in your life.
1111	I'd say both are bad, but if you have a bad father, your kids will learn that it's okay to be that way and not do anything. If you have a bad father, your kids will learn that it's okay to be that way and not do anything. If I got married and my husband was a bad father, I would tell him to step up and be the good father that he can be or leave the house and never come back.
1112	It was therefore only natural that Raffles had entrusted Farquhar with the task of making Singapore a prosperous city, while he had left it to Farquhar to manage.
1113	I mean, people who watch porn, I guess it's okay, it's normal. But people who are in the porn, I mean, I read that in an abnormal psychology book, that means they're suffering from some kind of disorder.
1114	It's not just morally wrong, it's also affecting how women are viewed in society today. It's against the empowerment of women, because they're seen as nothing more than sex toys. And that affects how men perceive women, which will, in turn, lead to a lot of disrespect and misperception.
1115	I'm sorry, I don't understand why people would do that, if they want to have fun with sex, masturbate or something like that.
1116	I don't know about you, but watching people having sex is wrong. Maybe you all feel differently, but if you wanna watch people having sex, get a mirror and have sex yourself. Kids are watching it and doing the wrong things!
1117	Jarman: porn's bad, because it should be in 4D, with surround sound and special effects, which would make it much more enjoyable. By the way, I'm a girl.
1118	Then, according to your theory, the fruit flies would've adapted and survived. So, I'm not really sure how that argument holds.
1119	* If evolution is real, why isn't humanity evolving anymore?
1120	You're not really aware of debate because what I'm doing is called "Cross Examining," and that's a common tactic to expose weaknesses in your opponent's argument. Also, calling names in debate is never a good idea. You just can't answer my questions, and I'm sure that's really annoying you.
1121	First of all, why is creation not a scientific thing? Second, why is it in the category of religion? And third, do these deluded people think they're looking like monkeys?
1122	Hey, Internet Explorer's got the world's best interface for viruses, so why don't you just stick to M$ Internet Explorer and welcome these cute little viruses?
1123	It says it loads faster than IE, but in reality, it takes nine times out of ten times longer for someone who just installed FF to load the program than it does for IE to load.
1124	It's an indisputable fact that an average IE user has a 2500% higher chance of getting laid than an average firefox user. Sorry firefox losers, game on, match up with IE misery somewhere else 8*(
1125	If physical education wasn't there, you'd be a couch potato!
1126	There were many pests in the time, and people suffered from them. Raffles was not there, so William had to think of a solution himself.
1127	William legalized gambling, but he did it for Singapore's prosperity, Raffles refused, and left Singapore alone.
1128	Farquhar had made a significant contribution, even paying with his own money to start the colony in the jungle, by offering money to the people to hunt and eradicate rats and centipedes, while Raffles had done nothing like that.
1129	Farquhar had been the one to put these operations into effect, while Raffles had only suggested what might or might not have worked. Actions need to be taken, and Farquhar had taken the steps suggested by Raffles.
1130	Even though William had done much for Singapore, Farquhar had been unfairly exiled by Raffles.
1131	I don't think a mother should have the right to kill her baby, but she should have the right to decide whether or not to classify the fetus as a person.
1132	People can choose for themselves, and it's not our decision or the government's to bring more unwanted children into the world.
1133	A couple of years ago, a girl of nine, living in poverty in South America, was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant of twins. Her family knew she'd be dead when she gave birth, but they wouldn't let her have an abortion because they were Catholics. She and her two children died. Three lives lost. One of them was actually living.
1134	Abortion is okay because a fetus isn't a person. To be a person, you need to have both of the following criteria: You have to be a person (homo sapiens) and you have to be able to make a difference in society. By this criteria, a fetus isn't a person, and therefore aborting isn't murder.
1135	If you think that life begins at conception, not at birth, then America gives citizenship to people "born" in America, but not to those who are conceived here. Well, if you really think that life begins at conception, and that he's a full person with rights to life, then we should also give citizenship to that person, right?
1136	All I'm saying is, there's real evidence for evolution!
1137	Is God coming to judge us in 2100, not in 2000? He's all powerful, so he created some single celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself, "I'll start this thing called evolution and see what happens. Yes, I'll improve these little organisms a bit, then maybe one day humanity will evolve, and I will be able to give Mary birth to Jesus." All of this makes so much sense, and is a good use of God's time.
1138	How come people aren't evolving anymore? How are you so sure we're not? Could you please show us some proof that we're not evolving? And don't tell us, because we'd notice if we were. Solid, verifiable evidence is your key to proving your point.
1139	We've got an exciting and passionate love life with my wife, and we love porn. We put it on, and it just makes the place explode. It's a way of sharing and expanding the love we have in bed, so as long as it's legal and everyone is 18.
1140	I think societal good is more important than personal interest, because it's always better to help other people. It's more probable that things will go well when people assist each other. You become a role model by helping someone in need. Sure, personal interest is important when you think about going to college, but then you need to think about leaving a legacy by teaching others what you know, so the learning or society process can advance, so you allow others to take it to the next level.
1141	In my opinion, promoting the common good is better, because when you help somebody else, not only is it appreciated by the person or group of people, but it makes you feel better. That doesn't mean I'm not going to spend time on myself, but when I get a chance to help somebody else, I'll do my best.
1142	This is Earth, which is shared by billions, not just you, and if any of us have an opportunity to improve humanity, we should take it. Choosing personal gain over bettering the common good is selfishness. There's no other way.
1143	Taking care of the common good is always better than pursuing personal interests. If everyone chose to do so, they'd all see the results. Of course, most people would choose personal interests because they'll get something out of it.
1144	I'm sure it's not selfish to help yourself. If everybody looked after themselves and tried to become better people, there wouldn't be any use for the common good. You're the only one who knows how you feel, think, and believe. If you want change, you'll change yourself.
1145	I'd say it's better to serve the common good, because in the end, it'll pay you back. Be it money, fame, or just karma.
1146	It's a good idea to separate students from other people, at least in terms of clothing jobs. Why do we use military uniforms? Because they're distinct from civil. Why don't terrorists use military uniforms? Because they're in harmony with civil, and it's simpler to attack the enemy.
1147	The school uniform doesn't harm students' lives emotionally, and when it comes to expression, imagine a bully wearing a shirt, tie, pants, all cleanly ironed and with nice shoes. He wouldn't look nice. Remember, your clothing sense is also part of your interview.
1148	I'd rather have a bad father than no father, because at least you have someone.
1149	I'd say it's better to have a bad father than none at all. It's important to have a role model, and without that, you can get lost in the world. A bad father isn't all that bad, because what exactly makes a bad father is that he's always working, and he doesn't have time for you. A dad who's not always there isn't a reason to prefer not to have a dad. Growing up and seeing your dad the way he is, makes you wanna be like him, or gives you the incentive to overcome him, and become even better than he is.
1150	It's better to have a bad father for practical reasons. You can blame your dad for everything you do. He won't pry into your life, search your room, take your things because he doesn't think I need them. He wouldn't care enough to get mad and throw my bag with my computer in it into a wall, making a hole in it, because I didn't clean my sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think that's just an opinion, because that kind of dad is still bad, because he's going to say to you that he hates you and that you've ruined his life.
1151	I'm not ever going to want to be here, like punching a dream that brings life to my nightmare, If it breaks down, I'll definitely wake up to the light of day. This is worse than it looks
1152	I'd say TV's more useful when you're watching information channels, and it's more useful than books, because you can change channels and look for documentaries on various subjects, and when you're finished learning and you're ready to rest, you can change to a funny show or whatever else you like.
1153	If you're only fluent in one language, but you move to another country, then most books won't be in your language, but TV is in all sorts of languages, and you can hear the way words are said in other languages.
1154	Gay marriage can cause a lot of trouble for people, in extreme cases it can lead to murder and suicide.
1155	I remember that India, after sixty years of independence, is seen as a country that could become a sixth member of the United Nations Security Council, and we all know that India has made a huge contribution to the discovery of God Partical, so where does the idea come from that India doesn't have the potential?
1156	India has the potential to lead the world, but I don't think it'll happen any time soon.
1157	We have scientific proof that the Noah's flood was not real. Think about this: If the flood had happened, we would have expected to find remains from long dead animals and people all over the world. We haven't found any of that. Dinosaur bones are found on many different layers of rock strata at different levels. If the flood had happened, we would have expected to find dinosaurs and all other remains on the same layer of rock, but we haven't.
1158	Honestly, I think it's better to try some other options than spanking, which can change a child's way of thinking, or make him depressed.
1159	I honestly believe that spanking a child is not a good way to discipline it, there are many other ways parents can deal with it. That's why we have a mouth to talk and tell what's good and bad.
1160	Some parents hit their kids for little things, and that's not right. They'll always be afraid of them.
1161	While it may sometimes be necessary to hit your children, in my opinion, this should always be the last resort.
1162	No, I wouldn't have. No one should get away with murder, but I wouldn't have married someone who'd murder someone.
1163	If my husband killed someone, I'd have to turn him in, because I wouldn't be able to live knowing that he killed somebody, and the relationship wouldn't be the same, because now you see him as somebody else, you don't see him as your husband, you just see him as a bad guy, and he might be crazy enough to do something to you.
1164	I'll turn him in if my husband kills somebody, because that's a crime and for every act, I've learned there's consequences to everything. And he'll have to pay for the consequences of his crime.
1165	I'd definitely turn her in. No matter what, this is murder. No one should be committing murder, and plus, she could be insane and kill me or someone else. I'd live in fear at my own house because of her murder, and if I didn't turn her in, sooner or later, somebody would find out, and I'd get arrested for not telling. But it would be sad, because she's your wife and you love her, so I'd rather she didn't tell anybody, because that would simplify my life.
1166	Don't be fooled, the majority of abortions in this country are done for convenience. If I could kill someone whenever it wasn't convenient for me, I'd leave a trail of corpses when I went out.
1167	OK,no,and yes,physical education should be learning students how to eat well and live healthily,not forcing overweight students to do 10 laps on a track,but showing them that eating well and exercising can be fun,not having overweight students being bullied because they can't run as fast as others.That's what physical education should be.
1168	I'm not interested in whether or not calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call "marriage sanctity", gays should have equal rights to married couples. Civil union, marriage, the union of two souls, or whatever you call it, gays need to be recognized as such. Not allowing it is a violation of the Constitution, and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't hear this case because it's left to the states, while Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is.
1169	I think the argument is that there is a debate about whether gay marriage is right or wrong. I think it's right, because I think people should be allowed to express their feelings to someone they love.
1170	First of all, homosexuals have a fundamental right to equal happiness. Second, they're still in society. Third, allowing the third gender to marry would improve the government's image. And that there's no racism, sexism or hate.
1171	It's personal choice. It's okay if your religion or culture doesn't allow gay marriage. That's fine. It means you don't want to get married to someone of the same sex. But then why should that apply to other religions or cultures? Gay marriage doesn't affect your marriage to someone of the other sex. It just makes them marry and live their lives as they do.
1172	I'd say it's better to pursue your own goals, because when you achieve yours, you can help others more easily. And when you're happy with yourself, and enjoy helping others, you have the confidence and ability to make a difference in the world, while making yourself happy.
1173	I'm more of a selfish person, so I'd rather do something that improves my life, but every once in a while I have my giving moments, so it depends on how I feel. Right now, I'm going to choose personal interest.
1174	I'm not sure he killed his exwife and her girlfriend, but this book, which is very badly tasted and very insulting, is his pitiable attempt at persuading the overwhelming majority that he wasn't guilty. I think he's lost his mind, and since he's lost his civil case, his earnings from the book and other profitable ventures should be confiscated to pay the restitution he owes.
1175	Firstly, the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights states: "Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion, or prohibiting free exercise of religion; or abridging freedom of speech, or of the press; or abridging the right of the people peacefully to gather, and to petition the Government for redress of grievances." -Speech also includes expression 2) Desecration of the US flag is still legal, although recently (2005) the House passed a law making it illegal to desecrate the US flag. It is still pending approval by our legal system.
1176	No, it's not always better to wear one. On the radio today, they said that about 30,000 Americans die every year because they don't use their seatbelts, and about 10,000 die every year because they do have them on. It's a violation of my right, but I can't afford the fine either. And they're really tough on the fines these days.
1177	There's Scientology schools, where most kids who grow up with Scientology go, but I've never heard of them being taught at public school. There are a lot of front groups that do all sorts of good for society, like Narconon, and they don't advertise that they're Scientologists, so it's quite possible that if you hear that Scientology is being taught at some school, it's definitely run by Scientologists.
1178	I've worked for a couple of different police forces, and I believe them all. In terms of the city I live in, I'm very confident in the officers there, who are kind and respect community needs, and the chief is great, who supports his officers.
1179	You have clearly been violated your right to free speech by both the officer and the business owner. I would immediately file a complaint with the U.S. Attorney's Office, the F.B.I., and your local police chief, I would also contact all the media outlets I could get my hands on with the detailed story. If I had any extra cash, I would also file a civil suit against both the officer and the business owner. You have clearly been wronged, and don't even think about stepping down. Fight back. I've won 3 lawsuits against the police in my lifetime already, and I'm only 21 years old. We the people cannot stand for this outright ILLEGAL behavior by law enforcement. If you follow the proper measures, and take this to the top of the hill, that officer will never work behind a badge again, and the business owner will be liable for so many damages to you he'll be out of business.
1180	I'd say, sentence them to life in prison, put them in our worst supermax prison, put them on the street with a shirt that says, "I'm a terrorist who kills innocent women and children." The guards will see nothing wrong with that, they'll just ignore it. I think we'll find out that there's still honor among thieves, which won't stop anybody, but what will?
1181	This happens all over the world, even bad countries aren't held accountable. Like Israel, for instance, who has been breaking the law since 1967. Why was Israel protected by the United States, via Veto Power, and not militarily kicked out like any other normal country would have been? (e.g. Iraq out of Kuwait etc.) So in conclusion, the right answer would be that the world isn't fair, and just because some people have GUNS and "protection", (like some states have HUGE GUNS and "protection"), the law is lenient with them.
1182	I'd like the person responsible for killing someone in my family to pay, and if that meant going into a gas chamber or lethal injection, then that would be fine by me. It wouldn't bring back my loved one, but I would have been satisfied that he wouldn't do it again to anyone else. I thank you for the two points.
1183	I'm not sure that Hitler committed suicide in a German bunker in 1945, which would make him dead. But President Bush is still alive and well in 2006. Unless one of them can travel back in time, it's not possible for them to be the same person. I understand that part. I might never reach level 4 by answering these kinds of questions, but it's less boring.
1184	Regarding property, if it's in your house, no one can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging theft. Since it's unlikely the GP will fake a police report, I wouldn't worry about it too much. In general, police don't have the right to enter your house or property without a warrant, except when they respond to calls from home or when they respond to domestic violence. For the child, you really need to consult a local lawyer. There are too many variables for anyone to give you specific or accurate advice on the Internet. Good luck, stay positive.
1185	No, if we'd kept our legs closed, there would be no need to consider the unwanted people, and there are many who would love to but can't have it. If we'd just practiced self control, this would be a lot easier.
1186	If the minor is under 12, I'd say no, but when you're 12, I think you know what you're doing and how it affects you. And there have been murders in the U.S. committed by 12, 13, and I think they should be tried not only as adults, but punished as such.
1187	I heard that they took George Washington's portrait out of school because it's "unconstitutional". That's our founding father, and they just took his portrait out because they thought it suggested Christian values at school. But they teach kids about Hinduism and Judaism, but when it comes to Christianity, it's illegal to teach kids about that. And instead of trying to keep kids from having sex, they hand out condoms and try to "encourage" the mto be safe. I agree, that's twisted.
1188	First, my expertise. I'm a lawyer, and I used to work for a firm that argued about liquor licenses. Sending young decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol isn't entrapment, unless the young decoy used extraordinary means to persuade the clerk to sell it to him. The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors, and if the clerk just says, "Oh, come on!" and the clerk agrees, then the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime, and that wasn't entrapment.
1189	There is a reason you need to be an adult to sit on a jury. Young people, in general, do not have the rational and mature thought necessary to make objective decisions based on evidence, and tend to rely more on what their emotions tell them, which cannot be done in court.
1190	If that's the whole story, then the result is completely bogus. There's nothing wrong with touching someone on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There's only a problem when someone touches a "bad" place, which clearly wasn't going to happen and certainly wouldn't have happened in the middle of the street. What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on how to teach their daughter, the daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street, and the man should have gotten a lecture on how to behave in our lawsuit and sex-crime ridden society. There was no need for any trials or arrests. And how is someone who was not guilty of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That doesn't make any sense at all.
1191	The chances of legalizing marijuana are slim, at best, according to the current state of affairs. Smoking prohibitions everywhere, how food is prepared, what you can and cannot say, we're in the "control your every way shape in the mean for your own good" nanny state of mind.
1192	The polygraph uses a baseline and then goes on from there. If your friend was nervous from the start, that's what his baseline was. It measures changes, not overalls. It would have to be extreme for him to fail. You want to stand by your friend, so do what you think is right. Ask him to take another polygraph from another reader.
1193	While this may seem like a paradox, I believe that affirmative action is a form of reverse discrimination, and is necessary in some cases. The biggest problem we have today is that the playing field is not as level as some people think it is. Sure, African Americans have made great progress since the old Jim Crow days, but there is still much discrimination. Believe me, I would love to see these policies end, but that would only happen in a perfect, non-discriminatory world.
1194	You need to find a job. Your ex is trying to support a child or children, how do you expect them to do that and why should they bear your responsibility as well? GET A JOB! Said by an ex who is owed a lot of money and knows how difficult it is when a bastard doesn't pay what he owes. Are you my ex? If so, they're looking for you. Best wishes, Sue
1195	No matter who builds them, prisons should be for life in prison for big drug dealers, robbers, rapists, murderers, etc. to protect society from these violent sociopaths.
1196	First, drugs are illegal, so the punishment should go to that. Secondly, when someone uses drugs, they commit a crime, which might not have happened if the defendant had been clean. Third, consider his or her past, then determine a jail term and a rehabilitation program. I would recommend a 3 to 5 year sentence, with reduced time for good behavior. Yes, you're right that killing is a lesser sentence, which stinks.
1197	They have no idea what their choice is, if they're doing what China tells them to do, or they're not offering anything to the local population.
1198	I agree with some of the answers given, because children usually change from concrete thinking to rational thinking in those years, so some subjects are not taught until children are older. Some kids at a younger age may not know the difference in many cases, and may have trouble knowing what will happen or what will happen as a consequence of what they do.
1199	First of all, Walmart has the worst rating for how they treat their employees, I know people boycotting them, encouraging me to do the same. They're not Costco at all. Why would Californians pay for a store that treats its employees badly? Why would they pay for a store that cuts hours of full-time employees, cuts their benefits, puts them on Medicaid, uses state-run insurance plans, or whatever else they might need? Why would they want the stress that comes with anger and worthlessness, and the feeling of being trapped in that environment for so many hours a week? Why would they even bother having them around at all?
1200	First of all, you get what you pay for and secondly, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. I would also ask the agent for a copy of the policy itself, called a "sample policy" and read it very carefully. If you are comfortable, then go for it. Be advised, anything not covered by the policy in theory could be charged back to you. I work for an insurance company and have seen people's lives ruined by not having enough or the right type of insurance. Bad things do happen to good people. I hope this helps.
1201	It's ironic that in our hyper-capitalist society, you can give sex away for nothing, but you can't sell it. Yes, primarily moral reasons. There are arguments about health risks, but a regulated industry with checks and such would be, in principle, safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it currently is. In principle, I think it comes down to the fact that few people want to give society's "stamp of approval" on it. Would anyone want their daughter to think of it as "just a job" or an easy way to make some quick cash? Or would they want their husbands to be able to have sex without any hassle when they have some extra cash? Or would they like their father to casually go to a brothel after work? Some might not have a problem with that, but most people would disagree.
1202	I'm in favor of capital punishment, my emotions are strong, if someone had killed a family member, I'd want them to face the worst, but my rational, prevailing side is against capital punishment, because there is a risk that innocent people will be killed. People think DNA is a foolproof method, but it isn't, not all cases involve DNA, and people convicted before DNA testing often cannot get an appeal to have the test performed, so I'm opposed, lest I or someone I know ends up like the countless innocents who have been sentenced to capital punishment.
1203	I lost a friend a year ago to drugs, very sad, drugs are a psychological thing, there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness, for example, many alcoholics have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders, this is an excellent example of peer pressure, no one wants to hear about grown ups acting like little girls, society says, "hell no, let's go out and drink." The problem with drugs is that you cover one problem with another, therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compulsive use of drugs, so yes, I believe in treatment, I believe that one should help themselves... however, one can only get treated if they are willing to accept help.
1204	You're going to get fired if you catch up with them later, and then you're going to have to explain an even bigger gap in your employment history. If you want to get out of here, you need to hide your crime behind a clean work history, so you can't afford to get fired. Find a temporary job, if necessary, and then find a better one. Be reliable in those temporary jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference. Good luck.
1205	I'm not sure this is a good idea, but there's a lot less people living here, so I guess it's a good idea to do something about this. The sad thing is, corporal punishment might work, but it would be a media circus, and then it would be useless, there's got to be a better answer!
1206	Not really cause you did not fill out an accident report and your workplace will argue that you did it at home and you do not have any proof that you did it at work. That is why even a small cut should be reported to your supervisor, or you will not have a case. Did you tell anyone that your back was hurt before you left work? If you did, they must have signed an affidavit that you were injured at work and put your job at risk and risk losing their job, too. If you hire a lawyer, you better be prepared to face a long and difficult battle and, nine times out of ten, you lose. So it's best to go to the chiropractor, keep your job and write this up as a lesson the next time you tell someone that a couple hundred dollars is worth more losing your job and possibly getting blackballed from getting another job, cause when you fill out an application, I don't care what anybody says your ex-employer can blackball you and tell them what happened and you won't get the job.
1207	I'm not sure I agree with your question, but the fact that insurance companies would charge all, say, black customers more than white customers because they think black drivers have more accidents, I'm sure they'd be sued. But, anyway, cops and prosecutors carry and use weapons and handcuffs, put people in jail and prison, have the power to ruin the lives of innocent people who just happen to be of a particular race. Insurance companies just sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competing companies. Discrimination in cops matters a hell of a lot more than discrimination by insurance companies.
1208	It seems so, but no one is above the law. If he's a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau, and the city for code violations. If he's got the police and the police in his pocket, (that's a shameful thing to do), there's not much you can do. I would recommend staying away from him if at all possible. A better idea: contact your local news agency. Expose him on national TV! They love to expose people like that. It's good for ratings and it would cause him to stop (hopefully), or at least lose his business licence, etc.
1209	You're probably safe, not 100% sure, but 87% sure.
1210	I don't mean that it's okay to exclude people of different races, but they shouldn't have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more "diverse". Besides, there are many differences in appearance and skin color within a single race. Race shouldn't really matter that much.
1211	Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a donation to a company that will make profits, or a bet that you'll never get anything back, but it's quite likely that you'll never get anything back at all. The only benefit I can see is that there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary, it could change the world, if only it had the right funding. But if it was that great, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and fear that if you don't fund it, the product will never see the light of day.
1212	In my opinion, the stigma associated with marijuana is a result of society's general disapproval of the use of more hazardous drugs such as alcohol and cigarettes, which are socially acceptable. In fact, many scientists think caffeine and perhaps sugar are even more harmful than marijuana. This societal "norm" is the sole reason that marijuana is illegal and that many employers are not permitted to use it even in states where it is legal (Colorado and Washington). Alcohol and cigarettes have enormous negative effects on our society as a whole, but going out for a drink or having a few beers while watching a game is among the most common activities that people do when they want to get to know people or simply catch up on old acquaintances.
1213	We've all heard the adage "don't believe everything you see on the internet", which assumes that information gathered from other sources, offline, is more reliable. I disagree. I'm a real neutralist, who believes that just because a propagandist has the money to pay to spread his information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't make it any more credible than the typical things we see online. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, I just don't believe that idea.
1214	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them equal rights to others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my mind. I know their education rates are probably lower and their poverty rates are higher, but that's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said, I don't want to see statistics about poverty, education levels, crime levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positions of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how they are actually discriminated against.
1215	I know this isn't true for all religions, there are many, but I'm thinking mainly of Christianity and Islam, because those are the ones I'm most familiar with. I think religions make people stick to the views that are already established in them, which is not good. For example, Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. I know there are different opinions, but I think people would be more open to new ideas if they weren't tied to a thousand year old text. I'm not against religion, I just think your religion shouldn't be controlling your morality CMV.
1216	I'd like to see promoting COMPLEX SELF-ORGANIZING MATER as our ultimate goal. CSOM is a rare thing in this universe and it needs our help. We could send rockets to Mars filled with millions of types of microorganisms, hoping some survive and grow, then go to oceanic moons. This may seem like a crazy idea, but it's better than shuffle along with no species-level goal (aside from the basic goal of survival). If we measure ourselves only on how efficient we make food into people, as nature dictates, we'll miss out on our chance to be great. Humanity won't last forever. We need to do something really great before we go extinct. Religions offer goals, but they get so many simple things wrong that they can't be trusted. Their silly ideas should be ignored. Please share your ideas for what Humanity's ultimate goal should be.
1217	I know that no news agency is perfect, but I think Fox News is highly biased in its reporting, which may be because I don't like them, but I still see them as a shining example of what news should not be. Am I right to think that Fox News is the worst, or am I being unfairly biased against them, which makes me no better than them? Because of this, I feel that I am effectively closing my mind to many good, right-wing ideas, which is something I don't like.
1218	I would like to start by saying that I am a generally optimistic person, but sometimes I feel that the world is just a step away from catastrophe. This is a very difficult question, with many different answers, but I would like to have more hope for the future of the world and humanity.
1219	To keep this discussion focused, I ask that colleges in large cities be excluded. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a "college town", considering this factor makes the topic too broad for productive discussion.
1220	If there is a high unemployment rate, as there is today in most developed countries, why would there be a need for more low wage workers? Increasing the number of workers when the labour market is not growing only increases competition for fewer jobs, which employers will try to fill with the lowest waged workers.
1221	If the government wants to take away my means of defense, such as a gun, against people who want to harm me or my property, then I am being asked to rely on the government to provide me with the same level of protection that I would have had if I had a gun. Realistically, this means that police need to arrive within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my house. I think that is long enough for me to survive as an unarmed person facing an armed intruder. If someone is injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves with a gun, but were unable to do so because the government took away their means of defense, then I think the government is partly to blame for that situation.
1222	The usual objection is that all inventions need to be based on prior knowledge, and since knowledge is usually collective (laws of physics, previous discoveries/inventions), the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to humanity as a whole. However, I argue that innovation, or the ability to use that knowledge for entirely new purposes, is a private matter, and therefore intellectual property laws are essential. Furthermore, I argue that removing intellectual property rights would be harmful to science and progress, because fewer people would be willing to devote their lives to innovation.
1223	I think they're doing genocide against the palestinians in Israel. Just look at the number of victims on both sides, Palestinic victims are massively outnumbering Israeli victims. They don't seem to care if the people they're killing are Hamas, it seems like they're killing people just because they're Palestinic. If Hamas is using its people as human shield, as they claim, that doesn't justify killing them so carelessly.
1224	I understand that if the context of the tattoo or the jewelry is insulting, but if it's not, then it should not be an issue to show it at work. I think the refusal to show it at work only reinforces the idea that tattoos and piercings are for immature, mistakenly rebellious and unprofessional citizens.
1225	Freedom of religion is a false concept, like having the right to use any perpetual motion machine you like. It's not real, so guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful. Worse, it implicitly legitimizes it. If the Constitution had really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, a lot more people would have taken the idea seriously than they otherwise would, to the point that it would have seemed patriotic to have a preference.
1226	I'm hearing this is a hot button issue in the media. I think the requirement to present a photo ID to prove you are the person you say you are voting for and that you are actually of age is reasonable. Anything else that you legally need to be of age for (car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling, etc.) requires ID, so why not something as important as voting? There are even some who call it discriminatory, even going as far as to compare voter ID laws to Jim Crow laws. I think it only discriminates against people with bad priorities (IE someone who registers to vote, but doesn't feel the need to get actual identification.) Please change my mind. Thank you.
1227	If I understand correctly, the idea of the 12 hour clock is a relic from a time when we didn't have better ways of measuring and keeping track of time. I don't see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It would make more sense numerically, since there would be no need for a modifier like "am". It would also make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also would make things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00pm). From what I can gather, the only reason we still use 12-hour clocks is tradition and/or refusal to change.
1228	I honestly believe that fascism, when carried out properly, by a great leader such as FDR, can be beneficial to a nation and its people. Of course, it doesn't work for terrible people like Hitler or Mussolini, but what about Hideki Tojo, who, in my opinion, was a great leader, but he chose the wrong path, by joining the Axis, but he knew when it was time to give up, and when he saw the destruction of the atomic bomb, he stopped causing his people's blood to be shed. So, what would happen if fascism, with a great leader like that, still existed? In my opinion, it would prosper.
1229	We see naked animals all the time, and it's commonplace that sex is how most animals reproduce. Most people can survive meeting naked animals, or even seeing animals having sex, with minimal to no problems. People are basically high functioning animals, and the fact that there are nude beaches, nudist colonies, swingers clubs, or porn shoots is proof that nudity/sex in front of other people isn't dangerous or causes harm to anyone other than the people who are participating in it. Since there is no harm, there should be no laws regulating how we dress, or where we have sex, as long as we aren't on someone else's private property, where the person has the final say.
1230	**Employer** "Can you give 110% at work?" **Employee** "No, but you'll pay me 10% more." **Employer** "No, but you'll get your answer then." **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **Edit** **
1231	I agree that it is best to keep all ideas in mind when trying to generate creative solutions, even when you start evaluating them (you should keep them in mind and only slightly qualify them). Full rejection of ideas or weaker associations between different ideas, while seemingly pragmatic, only stifles the creative process. Therefore, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to work effectively. Do you agree or disagree? Why or why not?
1232	I'll go with The Incredible Hulk, or rather Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong, and when he's angry, he gets even stronger. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every defeat I hand him, plus the fact that I can put 105 lbs on my head, compared to his paltry 100 lbs, rages him to near-insanity, which is why he's always wrong about the issues! ;o) Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Thoughtprocess' Momma is extremely hard to defeat, even though Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very strong, he just couldn't defeat him. Snapilicious!
1233	I'm sorry, I'm 17 years old, very athletic, recently joined the army reserves, and I'm a straight A student who occasionally gets a B+, so I'm not retarded, which is a very rude thing to say, because retardation is a terrible thing that can happen to anyone, and there are real retards in the world, and I'm in my last year of high school, so I haven't dropped out, and since I'm active and very athletic, I'm not a lazy fat ass, thank you very much!
1234	The Dark Knight is a big epic, but the strength of the first issue lies in its subtleties. It's a crime comic rather than a superhero story, where Batman fights corrupt cops and crime lords with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli's realistic art fits the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less revenge driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they should have made more than four issues.
1235	It's like Darfur, where innocent people are being massacred without mercy, and we're allowing it. Think about this: If there were terrorists in your own country, wouldn't you want help? The same thing is true for Darfur, people are desperate for help, but they're not getting it.
1236	I'm sure that most people who say that have a very poor understanding or knowledge of American history. Furthermore, it's impossible to judge a leader who hasn't even finished his term, let alone such an extravagant one, People look at history objectively and only consider it within their own generation.
1237	If you're wealthy, you can live the way you want, take vacations, pursue your interests and hobbies, and live the life you want. If that's not enough for you, you can give a lot of money to the poor, and people will still like you. If you still have anxiety about things, you can hire a coach and other things to make you less anxious, and your friends around you will make you feel better, especially if you use that money for a good cause.
1238	I'm sure the consequences are adequate, people needing to register as pedophiles, go to jail, pay fines, etc. These rules were made specifically for real pedophiles, and when teenagers and young people who are said to "not deserve it" are subjected to them, they are justified, because they are choosing to behave as criminals, and they need to be taught a lesson.
1239	As a catholic, I must say that it is against my religion to kill an innocent child.
1240	As a brief introduction, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. For those who do not know much about philosophy, just argue about the question. For those of us who do, there will be a debate within the debate. I will be arguing that we should kill the one person. My first regular argument is that even if you do not intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person), you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them. My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.
1241	The violence is caused by society, by advertising, by news, by us not seeing each other as people, but as things to interact with. We scream at the salesmen, because we do not see them as people, but as things to interact with.
1242	Opera is wonderfull, it has all the nicest features of a browser, but it's not known very well. For example, "Speed dial" shows your 9 most frequently used bookmarks when you create a new blank tab. It also has many addons, but the community is just beginning.
1243	"In the end, more people died in secular governments than any form of religious "war" in history." The number of people killed is not an adequate measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, so a religious war that killed half a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same number of people killed in a modern war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war. A better measure would be some sort of "misery index," which would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of non-believers.
1244	Love is just a chemical reaction in the brain, so who's to say teenagers can't fall for each other? At least for a while.
1245	I'm not familiar with the story, I'm not familiar with the details, I don't know what the slap was, how strong it was, what part of the body I'm missing. But I do believe that turning your back on such an hostile situation and pointing out that this is the domain of police or child protection services deprives us of a little humanity. I don't mean that every intervention has to be violent or threatening, but sometimes it's worth and necessary to intervene, even if it's going to result in serious legal consequences. That's why we stop when we see an accident and offer assistance. If it were me, I'd want to intervene. But who knows if you'd be able to say unless you're in the situation.
1246	We must accept that steroids were widespread in Major League Baseball for 20 years, beginning in 1985 or so. Some baseball records will probably be broken and altered, but that's not the point. The Hall of Fame is, in essence, a museum chronicling the history of baseball, good and bad. To exclude someone from the Hall of Fame because of "suspected" steroid use is ridiculous. It's folly to admit one person into the Hall of Fame because we "don't think" they used steroids, but deny another entry because "we think" they used them.
1247	I don't think this debate has any morality. Most MEDC's are trying to bring equality between man and woman, and here we are looking at women having to raise kids. Kids choose who they want to live with in court or out of court, and if a mother is mentally ill, then she doesn't have a chance of being somebody one day. Maybe you should say that in most cases kids choose to live with their moms, but there are some cases where dads have to get involved, and personally, I think they have to.
1248	I still love the food, but I stopped coming here because of the service. For example: today I went there with a small group and the place wasn't busy at 1 p.m., but the servers were acting as if they were still busy and the place was still dirty. The server we had (who had red hair and looked like she'd been in a crack house) was rude and kept acting as if we were an inconvenience. Even when I went to pay, she was a bit snarky. But I still over-tipped because it was a holiday.
1249	This place is horrible. We walked in and for over five minutes nobody acknowledged us, but the employees stared at us and knew we were there. Then they said we'd have to wait 10 minutes. We waited another few minutes and then they said we'd have to wait 15 minutes. There were plenty of seats available. Very bad people skills, including what looked like a young lady manager.
1250	This place is my favorite place for Korean barbecue, next to Gen and Hwaro. We always order the marinated beef and boneless ribs, plus a lot of sides! The only thing I'd like is gyoza or some other starters, but all in all, I'll keep coming back here and if my friends have some leftovers, we'll go to Rolled Ice Cream afterwards!
1251	I have been going to The Zen for over a year now and have yet to be disappointed in the quality of the food or the excellent service. I have tried many different dishes and always find them to be my favorite compared to other places. I have had pleasant conversations with Steven and begged him to open a store in Peterborough so I could enjoy the food more often. Some of the dishes I would recommend are Chicken Pakora, Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and Goat Curry but there are many other delicious selections. If you are looking for something different or just looking for a new place to eat, I highly recommend The Zen.
1252	I'm not sure why this place has so many bad reviews, but our experience was great. We arrived around 9:00pm and were seated right away. The place filled up in about 15 minutes, but our server was still very efficient, knowledgeable and helpful. We ordered the 2-for-$35 BBQ platter which included ribs, chicken, pulled pork, tri tip, a hot link and an assortment of sides. The tri tip, ribs and chicken were great, and I never even tried the pulled pork. Honestly, better than any place we've ever eaten at back home. Beverages are a bit pricey, but you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass for $8.50 that would cost $7.50 alone in their store. All in all, I was more than pleased with both the food and the atmosphere.
1253	We had a great experience here. We had the special of the day which was the Beef Wellington and the bread pudding for dessert, with Mac and cheese. The Beef Wellington was very tender and the bread pudding was a great dessert. We were very full and took most of the Mac and cheese home.
1254	First of all, I'm going to say that this was my first visit to Tim Horton's and I heard great things about it. We went in for breakfast before our train back to the States. I had the BELT (bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato) on a pretzel bagel. The bagel wasn't fresh and the eggs were barely there. My girlfriend had bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. That thing was tiny and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big. Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid. They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds. Because of that we had to throw it out. We were already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up to loss.
1255	I'm against wearing school clothes, because it makes you look unattractive and you can't show your true self, so wearing school clothes is fine.
1256	No match. FF's usage is superior in every way.
1257	It depends. It would still be scary to sleep with someone who deserves to be killed. So it's a maybe or maybe not situation. So I'm not sure.
1258	No, I'm not thinking of turning that on my spouse, and I know she'd be beside me if I did it, and wouldn't say a word.
1259	Books are better than TV, because they're cheaper to buy, and if you want a TV, it's really expensive, and you need a TV license. Books can teach you a lot, and TV shows are violent or not suitable for kids, so books are really superior.
1260	No matter what new technological developments come, books will always be important because they have a permanent place in every human heart.
1261	I strongly believe that India is unable to lead. You're talking about India's 7th, 3rd, 2nd place in terms of defense and agricultural land, but this is about the highest power, and we can't rely on 2nd or 3rd. Additionally, people are lazy. They don't have the time to think about the country's development. They're happy at home.
1262	India is having problems managing itself first, so there is no question of leading the world so far...but still, if we compare...1. Almost 90% of India is illiterate (I'm not sure of the percentage), so an illiterate country can't lead the world.2.India is more into castes, politics, religions, and less into development.3.The most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence in itself and is still cursing itself...so if this continues, it will be difficult or even impossible to say that "India will lead the world when it can't lead itself!"
1263	India's potential to lead is that it is the world's second biggest country, third biggest army, and Indians have no fear. We are proud of our country, and we will lead the world, and rule it in every way.
1264	If you were a fatherless child, you'd only feel pain when he wasn't there for you, and you didn't know how he was. A bad father could have gained your trust, then walked away. Some would say that knowing your father was there is enough. For me, having a father who does nothing is itself an absence, because in either case he doesn't know anything about you, and you don't know anything about him. I'd rather he didn't exist at all, than he was constantly in and out of my life.
1265	I'd rather be fatherless, the reason is, I never had a dad. And if you've got a bad dad, you'll end up being just as bad as your dad. Parents should be role models, not just lazy.
1266	I'm telling you, I've been through this before and sometimes I want a bad father, but not having a father is better. It's been eighteen years since I saw my father, but if he doesn't care, then why should I? If he wanted to be in my life, he should be in my life. But being fatherless isn't such a bad thing, because I have my mom, and that's my mother.
1267	No, if you look into Farquhar, he didn't do anything for Singapore when Raffles was gone, he just created a mess and let vice, crime, and gambling go on.
1268	In the past, kids could go wherever they wanted, from candy stores to schools. Now, kids are pornographers, sexual predators on the internet. Pornography is a gateway to new crimes.
1269	Even if people have sexual desires, that doesn't mean they should be watched by people you don't even know in pornographic content.
1270	I meant the creationist version of evolution, sorry.
1271	I'll show you that since the dawn of recorded history, man hasn't evolved.
1272	It doesn't make sense. Why are we still evolving, and the monkeys aren't? Why aren't fish jumping out of the water, growing feet? If that happened billions of years ago, why isn't it happening now? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with feet growing? What caused evolution to stop for a mysterious thousand years?
1273	You're in school with me, 14 years old, that's funny.
1274	People sit at their desks all day playing video games when they need to exercise. So fat people go outside and play football or something, and not fat people stop playing video games and get their energy back, and these are my words "peace out, shitheads."
1275	I'd say we should have a gymnasium, 'cause kids are getting fat and chubby! It's not okay for kids to be fat and chubby!
1276	Faquhar used money from his pocket to solve problems in Singapore, when rats and centipedes were everywhere. He gave coins to the citizens for each pest they caught, and the problem was resolved fast because he kept his word.
1277	All over the island, centipedes and rats were causing harm to some people, and rats were also destroying food supply. The tiger threat was also present, so he resolved the problem by awarding rewards to those who killed the pests.
1278	Farquhar directed his men to Malacca, bringing back food. The Singaporean traders also brought some essentials.
1279	It's not yours, or anyone else's, it's the decision of the person concerned, whether or not to abort. This is such an exaggerated matter, people are getting killed on both sides, it's ridiculous, and it must be left alone.
1280	It is not surprising that Hitler's mom wanted him aborted.
1281	There's no need for an argument, since the entire scientific community agrees that evolution has and will continue to occur.
1282	Everyone's got their own desires, and pornography is a degraded medium, but it's their decision to go down that career path, if they want to.
1283	According to Northwestern University's law professor, easy access to pornography may be one reason for a rape rate of 87% in the past 25 years.
1284	If pornography and those who produce it were respected in society, there would be no argument that pornography is degrading. Similarly, if we were to criticize movie actors, for example, then being an actor would become degrading. It is not the production of pornography that needs to change, but its reception in society.
1285	Somebody says God doesn't like porn, but we're not going to know that because the Bible doesn't talk about porn, and it didn't exist at the time of the Bible. So how do we know it's a sin?
1286	I'd say it's more important to serve the common good than pursue personal interests, because it's more beneficial to assist others than focus on yourself. We must improve our community first, before we improve ourselves.
1287	For example, football is a team sport, and all of them need to believe in each other, not in themselves, because "team" is not "I", like last night at the Super Bowl, when the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the final 2 minutes without the linebackers blocking for the quarterback, and the quarterback believing in the linebackers, and the receivers believing in the quarterback, so we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
1288	I think it's better to serve the common good than pursue personal interests, because most people care more about themselves than others. Serving yourself before serving others won't do much good in the long run. I believe that "what goes around comes around", so when you do something for others before serving yourself, not only will it help them, but it will also help you.
1289	1. It makes everyone equal - if kids can wear whatever they like, some kids will be teased and feel less equal to their peers around them compared to uniforms. 2. Okay, look school is about learning, not about your appearance and clothing. But maybe it matters on some level. Most people that go to school where they don't have uniforms take like 1 hour to find pants or shirts. I mean, really? If they have uniforms, it takes less than 10 minutes to get them out and put them on.
1290	It's a great idea, kids should be equal, they shouldn't be comparing clothes, when they see something new among their classmates, they want to buy it, even if it's not necessary.
1291	It's less awkward when people say you have to wear school uniform and you're wearing a mufti...
1292	Uniforms will make it less likely that someone will say "oh, you're not wearing that" or "you're wearing that" and then everybody will be wearing the same thing, which makes it look better, and it will take you less time to think about what to wear.
1293	I'd say it's better to have a loving father than no father, because growing up without a father would have a big impact on your childhood, making you question who your father was and what he was bad at or good at. Also, growing up without a loving father means you can't prove to your father that you're great, meaning the son he gave you turns out to be smarter and better in society.
1294	I'm fond of TV, 'cause you can watch all the porn you like with your family.
1295	TV may be superior to books, because TV shows faces of characters, and actions that are difficult to decipher from books.
1296	I don't say this because I love TV, but there's a lot of information on TV that you don't know.
1297	You can watch TV for hours, while a book takes all day to read. So you won't get any physical exercise while reading books. Physical exercise on TV makes you move, so TV is much better than books!
1298	TV's going to win, hopefully. It's good to watch anything on TV.
1299	Aquafina (Pepsi), Dasani (Coke), Perrier (Nestle), which employs Americans,
1300	Ban on plastic water bottles would be a big mistake at this time. Every day, more than 1 million Americans buy bottled water, which contributes to economic recovery. Maybe not in a big way, but every little bit helps.
1301	Why are you fighting a U.S. decision when you're in Canada?
1302	If they continue to implement a positive and effective economic agenda, their main task will be to promote their economy to all investors and tourists. Regards, Jerwin "consultant on poster printing in San Francisco".
1303	India's international institute, such as the Nalanda campus, where students from all over the world came to study...discovery of decimal and zero
1304	Indian culture and languages were established two thousand years ago, and other nations discovered their languages.
1305	The Ndians have always been strong, why do you forget their ancient glory and history?
1306	I don't think there's any doubt in my mind that India is capable of leading the world.
1307	I'm sorry it turned out this way, with not so little respect and so much spam. I'm going to choose atheism over Christianity because there's not enough evidence to satisfy my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
1308	Notmymuse, give me one logical reason to believe in Christianity. Just one. I've yet to see one shred of evidence for Christianity, and I've seen mountains of evidence against it. Once you've discredited all evidence against Christianity, create an argument in favor of Christianity based on empirical facts, or a damn good priori argument. Once you've disproved every argument against Christianity, then disprove all religions. Until you've done all of these things, it's illogical to believe in the Bible.
1309	Science has proved it, it's just an excuse, so people from simpler times don't have to think too hard about such big questions.
1310	No one ever fought in the name of atheism.
1311	I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as a means of disciplining their children, because spanking is painful enough to teach children to avoid bad behavior.
1312	Yes, because they must learn a way to remember that when they do something wrong, they're going to be hit.
1313	I've been spanked once in a while for worse behavior, and to be honest, it did more good than harm. It's like touching a fire, but a lot depends on parents and kids. Maybe it's doing its job, maybe it's not, but abuse is never okay.
1314	Christianity's all about promoting better morality and ethics, and atheism doesn't make any difference if you think that you should be following Christ's lead.
1315	I'm not a Christian or an atheist. I'm a Moslem, and that's the best religion.
1316	This debate simply shows that the Internet is full of narcissists and atheists who are totally prejudiced and intolerant of other people's beliefs and cannot let people practise or not practice their religion as they wish. Atheists are bullies, plain and simple.
1317	Science is confirming the existence of God, the question is only which one.
1318	Christianity, because I'm always rooting for the underdog. Here, atheists have a much larger number of adherents.
1319	Christianity is offering hope to the world, urging people to assist the needy.
1320	God's helping those who help themselves! So I'm going to help myself to the school laptop, then God's helping me?
1321	I agree that you can lightly spank a child when it's getting to a certain point, but never to the point where you're beating a child.
1322	Because when a child is young, he doesn't know what's bad and what's right, so a parent must teach him what's bad and what's right.
1323	No, I don't think that disciplining a child should be done only to punish the child. Parents could just scold their children to stop what they're doing wrong. Physically, hitting a child isn't the answer, because it's not only a matter of emotional pain, it's also a matter of physical pain. Kids won't learn to respect their parents, because they'll only learn to fear. They won't do the wrong thing again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they're just scared of being hit by their parents.
1324	There are different ways of punishing a child, so don't hit it.
1325	I'd have turned my spouse in for murder, if I'd known she'd killed someone. You can't love someone who's not the person you fell for, and I wouldn't have fallen for a murderer.
1326	I'm all for the no snitching, but when it comes to murder, that's when the line is crossed. Sure, I probably wouldn't do anything at first, but then I think there are many reasons someone would be driven to murder, but I don't think that act should be committed. In saying that, I would turn my wife in if she killed someone.
1327	It's good to have choices, but the world would be completely destroyed if you had all the choices you made. I'm always for life, and I believe abortion should be illegal.
1328	No one has the right to say what you can and can't do with your body, but when the thing you're trying to get rid of moves away at the first sign of pain without you feeling it, then it's not yours, because it feels like something other than yours.
1329	Homosexual people are people, same as we are, and they should have the right to marriage.
1330	I think that if there weren't ewapons, there would've been less control of the masses, which would've been a good thing, and there would've been calmer and less calm areas in the world. There would've been little communities, and then gang-run cities. But at least all the fighting nobheads would've killed themselves in one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it.
1331	I'm not sure it's very charitable to donate your old clothes that you no longer want, and then expect to get something in return, like a tax write-off. Do you even know what the word "charity" means?
1332	A good suggestion for an amendment to the Constitution would be to change the requirements for president. You would still have to be 35 years old and have been a US citizen for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part. Instead of being a US citizen, make it be a US citizen for 40 years. This way people whose parents move here when they're kids; this is the only way they know and know as much as any other kid here. I think this would be a great topic to discuss in your paper and could easily be elaborated on with examples. Remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
1333	It seems you want to convict the police before all the facts are investigated. Remember, innocent until proven guilty.
1334	It is very good to have a financial advisor, but if it is a legal inheritance, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor. Other than the investment, there is nothing else you need to worry about. You do not need to inform the government, you do not need to include it in your taxes, unless you want to, and frankly, other than investing, there is nothing more you need to do, other than get the check, cash it, invest it, and live.
1335	If you're serious, maybe you could give some to a good cause. A young family struggling to make ends meet, going to work every day. An elderly person on welfare who can't pay their electricity bill. Give to a children's hospital, animal welfare, or senior center in your area. Lots of things you can do. I hope you find what you're looking for.
1336	If he doesn't have a good lawyer, you need to hire one immediately. These cases are particularly difficult, as there is more at stake than you might realize. For example, a conviction for drug possession could significantly reduce or eliminate your eligibility for federal student aid at college, if he chooses to pursue this path. While it is illegal to supply someone with a drug that is not prescribed to him, there is always a basis to review this with the prosecuting authority. I strongly recommend that you contact a good criminal defense lawyer in your area, and be prepared to pay a substantial retainer. For a referral to a good criminal defense lawyer, contact your local or state bar association.
1337	Is this a traffic ticket? Look at the ticket. If it says you must appear in court, then you have to go. I wouldn't listen to the cops, unless it says in the ticket that you must appear. Just pay the fine or whatever it says on the ticket. It's very important that you follow the instructions on the ticket. Or ask your husband. He probably knows the city attorney, and he can get you off this.
1338	Yes, prostitution should be legalized; let the local governments decide if they want it or not, and how they will deal with it, either by local laws or by zoning laws. The same goes for drugs; decriminalization or full legalization would allow governments to raise revenue that could be used for treatment and public health measures, and would remove a source of more violent crime that supports these illegal activities. There is no reason they should be illegal, and there are many reasons they should be legalized.
1339	He's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing. These cases can cost a fortune to pursue, and he must make sure that this is a profitable investment, meaning that not only is this a good case that they can reasonably expect to win, but that the recovery will be sufficient to cover the time and expenses of pursuing it. And if he refuses to represent you, that does not necessarily mean that your case is not worth pursuing in general, but only that it isn't worth his attention. And if he feels that you don't have a case, he'll tell you that.
1340	If that person was under oath and confessed to a crime, then the court would have to take him into custody and begin the paperwork. Anybody who would testify in court to having committed a crime but didn't really commit it would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the state laws allow. Someone who truthfully, under oath, confessed to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. So God if you're listening, help them!
1341	And I've paid taxes for all these years, and I'm actually overpaying each year, and then in springtime we get a partial refund, which is wonderful, and which will allow us to cover credit card purchases we might have made at Christmastime, or home repair projects. But many Americans end up paying even more, because they didn't get enough deductions from their wages during the preceding year.
1342	Even if there are no minors, the language you use should attract people and not distract them. There is a psychological mechanism in these people that makes them believe that they are untouchable. They do not even care about your reaction. They do not wait for one. They know full well that their answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care? Just vomit and earn few points. Moreover it takes some brains to answer a question which they do not have. Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in their approach. Come on...'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term. The ethics, values, etc are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. You have got plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one cant find them and starts using fowl language. Therefore I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and keep on sharing your knowledge with us. Hope to hear from you soon.
1343	Is it legal to force your religion on people who don't believe in it? I think that's the question you're asking. And if it was Islam they were pushing in school, would you want your kid there? It's not only moral to remove religion from schools, it should be mandatory. Kids go to school to learn, not pray, not learn about God. If you insist on God being in schools, you should send your kids to a seminary for education.
1344	Well, you can strike the third answer down, my friend. False imprisonment is common, especially in states that do not have laws requiring the defendant to disclose information, and in my opinion, those states do not have those laws for the sole reason that they want to railroad poor and innocent people and "falsely imprison" them. The southern states are particularly good at that. As long as there is no discovery, the prosecution can hide facts that clearly show the defendant is innocent, and yes, they knowingly do this to enhance their conviction record, which will help them in their careers later. The thing that kills me is that not only are these criminals still able to sleep, but the law allows them to get away with it, and when the truth is revealed (usually years later), there is nothing the innocent person can do to get back the freedom that has been taken from him.
1345	Your chances are not good of getting beyond his limits. Your lawyer could sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won the case, you would have to go after him for garnishments, etc.. If he does not own a paid home or other material goods, your lawyer probably will not bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance, which will usually cover for uninsured motorists, if you carry that coverage, but he would have to determine if you could use it since you weren't driving at the time. Since you say you have $170000 in medical bills, I am guessing you don't have any personal medical insurance either. Your lawyer should be able to tell you what to expect after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
1346	It depends. They're both given for clear and extreme crimes. Then again, I'd agree with you that capital punishment should be stopped. I'm not talking legal terms, but moral ones, that no one has a right to take another's life, and if crime is committed, punishment should be "corrective" and the culprit should be forced to repent. Life in prison, or forced to rot in prison, or forced to work, is better than capital punishment.
1347	Is it true that felons cannot vote at all?
1348	The US can't afford not to be friendly with China, the politicians think, because China is a huge emerging market, consumer goods manufacturers with low prices, etc. So, even though China is probably a worse human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though it meddles and interferes with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass, because we need China as much as China needs us. Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically. So, we can afford to bully, assert our dominance in the hemisphere, freeze out the Cubans, hoping that Castro, or, more likely, his successor, will fall from power, and we can return to turning Cuba into the kind of cheap sugar and cigarettes satellite it was for decades.
1349	Freedom of the press does not apply to secret sources in the government who leak classified information. Court orders often affect more than just a news story. For example, when you have someone leaking important information that threatens the American people's welfare (nuclear secrets, etc.), you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole. Freedom of the press means you can publish whatever you like, but that doesn't mean you're free of consequences. Geraldo was thrown out of Iraq for publishing American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle. He should have been hanged.
1350	In this case, our constitutional right to privacy has clearly been violated, and I don't think it'd be too difficult for the government to get a warrant for legal listening. Bush and a few other government officials are just trying to cover their backsides, and there are many conspiracy theories about Bush and some other government officials. I think it's time for the people of this country to take back their government, too many "actors" in power with selfish intentions!
1351	Scott Peterson was a good contrast to OJ, he wasn't famous, he was just an ordinary guy. Like OJ, he killed his wife, but Scott's version of reality was totally out of control. It was a warning sign for the rest of us, don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and have sex with the psycho who was having sex with you while your wife was pregnant. Two, if you're an ordinary white guy, you don't get away with a crime like OJ got away with. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury, doesn't it?
1352	I disagree. First, it is the people of Singapore, not outsiders, who should decide. Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society. Singapore is a society that tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes diversity, but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created. Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is "more expensive" than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.
1353	If you continue to speak sense, they'll start listening to your phone calls and reading your e-mails.
1354	The idea that people have this right is ethical, and I support the idea that everyone has this right. But whether people actually have it is a matter of national law, and the laws of their countries. China, for instance, has government policies that restrict the information that people can freely receive. India, on the other hand, has domestic rights organisations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights, including that of information. (1) Every country has a segment that restricts information and any other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of political party, there are basically two kinds of people: those who want controls, and those who do not.
1355	Sure, we're going to replace one form of discrimination with another good idea. Now, instead of being proud of what they've done, they'll always know they didn't have to work as hard as other people, because they've been given positions. I think this kind of "reverse discrimination" is fueling a new kind of racism. I hate people who go to college with low test scores and a GPA solely because of their race, and they make money just because they're there. Congratulations, R.D., you've turned me into a racist.
1356	The sanitation workers, who instead of fighting for education, are fighting for better wages, benefits, etc., and the unions and the employers who have fallen for their lies. Americans are doing themselves out of work, so don't blame immigrants or employers. Where else can an unemployed person who doesn't fit in society find work for $20 an hour with health insurance, vacations, and paid sick days?
1357	Marriage is a business, and the license makes it legal. It's there to protect women's interests in property, and to raise kids. It's a shield. If you don't plan on staying with someone, or having kids, or creating property community, there's no need for it. People shouldn't do it lightly, and I think it would help reduce the number of divorces if they stopped offering marriage benefits. People wouldn't get married for money, or insurance, etc.
1358	No, a society that values human life and promotes peaceful solutions would be hypocritical to include flogging and capital punishment in its justice system. A system in which judges are human beings is subject to the risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed. Where sentences are decided by mortals, there is the risk that harsher sentences will be imposed on the basis of bias. Where the most wealthy people have access to the best lawyers, there is the risk that the less wealthy will be disadvantaged.
1359	The Church tends to exonerate itself whenever it can, for whatever reason, and I don't think this would be any different. The idea that the Church isn't flawed and is Christ's body is something that it has tried to hold to the highest degree ever since it was founded. If it has a flaw, misjudgements, bad management, whatever it is, can it see itself as Christ's body with all its faults? So in answer to your question, yes, I think it exonerates itself.
1360	It can, if you have the right lawyer. Racial remarks are a form of sexual harassment, and the company, the employee, and the supervisor can be held responsible.
1361	It doesn't make any difference whether you say it "a" or "er"; the fact that most black people cut the "er" off of words in the first place, while whites do, makes it sound degraded. I've been black all my life, and I've heard my mother and father say it, but I haven't really used it (sometimes by mistake if the people I'm with say it a lot, but I ALWAYS correct myself). I hate that word, and its use. I think people use it because they're afraid to say something else and look "corny". When I was in college, I suggested "Don't be my ni99a, my brother" day, and it worked.
1362	Annie Red I'm not sure about religion, and I'm a female. I've never heard a rational reason why abortion should be legal at any time, except when it's necessary to save a mother's life. Partial birth abortion isn't just murder, it's torture. Stop stereotyping people who are against abortion.
1363	Money isn't the root of all evil, it's the love for money.
1364	I think that if you're old enough to commit an adult crime, then you should be punished like an adult. If we keep letting our youth off with serious crimes, then the older criminals will keep getting our youth in trouble. We have to raise our kids right so they don't end up in jail, but there are things that are morally wrong whether you're 15 or 35 and those are the things our young "adult" should be charged with.
1365	Notify your lawyer immediately, if you do not have one, and if you do not have one, get one. Check with the court to see if there is a hearing on Friday. Even if you haven't been served with papers, it's not a good idea to ignore this situation as others have suggested. For example, your ex might have arranged for someone to falsify the proof of service to show that you were properly served. You might have to request a continuance and properly prepare for the hearing. If there is a hearing and you do not appear, the court may make an adverse ruling against you that is hard to undo.
1366	Youtube is a big video site with many videos, Twitch is a streaming site, where you mostly watch someone playing a game. If youtube took over Twitch, it would help with the servers, and Twitch would run faster. This is just my speculation though. Also, youtubers could get help with streaming, and this would help promote their channel. Also, Youtube could then cater to a wider audience, thus making Youtube bigger. I understand that Google owns Youtube. I'm a big Youtube user, watch many videos a day, and upload my own content, so if there are any downsides, I want to know about them and put things in place to try and prevent them happening to me.
1367	The government is correct to say that teenagers shouldn't drink, but in my opinion, no one who has already passed his teenage years should be refused. Obviously, the age should not be 18, because that would be easy for teenagers to get drunk. The current age of 21, which completely undermines the 20th birthday, which is the beginning of a new decade, and probably the most important event in a person's life, and instead of celebrating, most people just forget about their 20th birthday and wait another year.
1368	In the UK, every few years the government's "cabinet" has a reshuffle, and the Minister responsible for, say, education changes to the Minister responsible for, say, transport. Surely it would be more sensible to have elections every few years where academics in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) compete for the position? The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system, then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me - CMV.
1369	I'm not saying all poor Americans are like this, there are many who have mental or physical health problems, or had a very bad start in life. But the majority of poor Americans are happy, and do not want to work, or go to college, or put in the hours needed to climb the social ladder.
1370	My school's policy is that when there's a bomb threat, the whole school must gather in our stadium and wait until police and the bomb squad arrive. However, a clever terrorist or someone could easily find out about this (which all schools do and state on their websites) and set off a bomb in that stadium, killing all students and teachers. It's more sensible for me to just get into my car (which isn't on campus), get out, and live 100 percent of the time. My school tells us if we're doing a drill on that day or not, so I'll know if this is a real threat.
1371	"Public officials" may be elected, though the process is barely transparent and verifiable by most voters, but they rarely face sanctions for turning bad ideas into laws that others swear to uphold. This also holds for the enforcers. If they get into scandal, the worst that happens to them is losing the next election, in exceptional cases, they may spend a few months in the most expensive prison, whereas those who are not politically connected and do the same crime face long prison sentences. "Public officials" have an abundance of opportunities to accept donations from special interests in exchange for passing laws that favor special interests, and then continue to cash in on this exchange by investing in firms they have helped to protect from competition, and in addition to numerous other kickbacks; namely, lucrative "consulting" gigs and the like. Why are most people okay with this? Are they just ignorant of the mechanism of this political machine?
1372	There are many arguments about how parity can be best maintained or enhanced, but I'm not sure it matters. The most interesting moments and periods in sports are when there are a few titans fighting it out, not a mediocre field where anybody can win. Sure, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of their competition in La Liga, but many people who otherwise wouldn't watch a match will watch it when they meet each other. People don't watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they watch games between the top two teams in almost any sport. True parity, if achieved, would make all teams play like that, why should I prefer that over having a few teams that are really great and exciting to watch?
1373	I admit I've never had a problem with this in my relationship, but once at an office building and once at a female friend's house, which I understand as she wants the place to look a certain way. The argument is that it's polite, but the counter-argument of leaving the toilet seat up after use is never put on the desk, and even if it had been, it would just make the whole thing seem a bit odd. And in a large building or household, the next person who needs to use the bathroom might be a man, and he might need to use the bathroom, so he'll have to put the toilet seat up again. And lastly, why the hell would you use a shared toilet without looking in the mirror before using it, and expect the male users of that toilet to do the same for themselves and women?
1374	I'm hearing more and more people saying that capital punishment should be used more often. I'm not sure how I feel about capital punishment, but in my opinion, it's used mostly as a form of societal retribution, similar to the way people used to put someone's head on a pike in the past. If that's true, shouldn't we want as many people to see what happens to people who are sentenced to capital punishment? At least, that would give the public information about what capital punishment is really like in the U.S., which could change someone's mind about capital punishment.
1375	In general, I think that the public has a right to know about stabs, robbery, etc., but that the names of the culprits should not be revealed to the public unless it's a matter of safety (the culprit is currently at large or in jail). Personally, I think that announcing the names of the culprits in murder/suicide cases only encourages other criminals to commit similar crimes in order to be covered up.
1376	MV: at this early stage in the evolution of climatic science, we do not know enough to predict what life will be like in 2100, and until we know more, we should act more pessimistically, just in case.
1377	One morning I was in a hurry and needed to pee, so I decided to multitask by brushing my teeth while I urinated sitting down. A few days later I was hungover and decided to do it again. Now I do it often, and I'm not telling anybody about it because it's "gay" and all that nonsense. I also do it when I've got morning wood and need to pee, so I can tuck my penis under the toilet seat, which is really annoying, because you know, trying to pee with morning wood is really annoying. It doesn't make it feminine for men to do it, because it doesn't involve any sexuality at all.
1378	I'm a 19 year old guy but I'm seriously considering getting rhinoplasty, chin, jaw and cheek augmentation. I wouldn't say I'm unattractive but I'm pretty average. I think that once I get the procedures done I'll be dramatically more attractive/handsome, more girls will look at me and that will boost my confidence to approach them, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face(and a strong body which I'm gonna build) will help me get into male modeling, which is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.
1379	I'd rather be too cold than too hot, Sub-zero has a wide range of abilities that beat most of his rivals, Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja, including the ability to freeze opponents and walk up and smack them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a full use of magic, very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Want to change my view?
1380	I'm honestly having a problem with the whole "rape culture" thing. We live in a safer time than ever, but we're also able to hear about every violent incident that happens anywhere on earth at any given moment. Especially the idea that we have to "teach boys not to rape." As if rape is something that's hard coded into the Y chromosome.
1381	I am 30, and it seems that we have been "at war" with al Qaeda/terrorism through military adventurism, nation building, and a massive shift of GDP into military contractors, at the expense of using that GDP to help our own citizens. In theory, this "war" will never end, because there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11, dating back to the year 1000). It also seems like a political tool of the right wing, to frighten old white conservatives into fearing brown people, so they elect the most hawkish neo-conservatives into office, to spend even more on Military adventurism. To me, it just seems like a huge scam to spend enormous amounts of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.
1382	I'm a light smoker. I get a box about 5 times a year when I'm stressed out, and this time it was an ugly breakup. Am I fooling myself when I rationalize that American Spirits aren't so bad because they don't have additives?
1383	I've been to four schools and the problem with all of them is that they rely on memorization instead of understanding the concept of what is being taught. I honestly learned more from reading. I think education should be improved so that students can choose their classes. Though, I understand, some classes are needed. But, others aren't. Some students will never be good at certain subjects and never want to be. For them, schools should take those classes out of the schedule (depending on the class), and replace them with something they plan on having a career in. Also, Economics should be in the main schedule. Many home foreclosures come from people who know little about the world of economics and rely on others to manage their money.
1384	Having gone through the Illinois court system, I now know that getting what you want legally depends much more on who you know. It's all about connections. Attorneys and defenders, prosecutors and judges, defense and judges, etc. It's just life, though. The best way to succeed is, in my opinion, to have an advantage over the other guy. Something that makes you stand out from the crowd.
1385	Europe isn't a continent, it's a cultural area, and there's no major divide between Europe and Asia. Some say the Ural Mountains are a barrier, but no other continents are divided by mountain chains, but by oceans and seas. Powerful Europeans just didn't want to be associated with Asia, and wanted to be called their own physical continent.
1386	The president's impeachment would be a catastrophe and a catastrophe for our country. We mustn't forget that Obama isn't the one who put us in such a bad economic condition, and if he continues to improve the economy, we might get back on the right track.
1387	You don't have a legal right to tell people what they can and can't read,write,or listen to,as long as it doesn't directly harm anyone. For example,if you read,write,or listen to a direct order to kill an innocent person,and you intend to follow that order,it's not legal.You also don't have a legal right to tell people what they watch in their homes,away from you and their impressionable minds in society. Watching porn in private is,and should be,legal.
1388	If we assume that man is artificial and not a natural phenomenon, then if we could create another being that is capable of being a sentient life form, that being will not be equal to us, no matter how smarter it might be, until it has accomplished the same things as we have, including creating more sentient life forms, and if it does, it will have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it goes faster it will be greater than us, or if it goes slower it will still be inferior to us. But this will only happen, if we, as "artificial beings" created by our creator, are capable of creating another sentient life form in the same image and likeness as our creator, and not just ourselves, otherwise it will never be our equal.
1389	I believe Kurt Cobain was murdered for the following reasons: 1. He had enough heroin to kill an adult three times over. 2. The so-called suicide note was written by two different people, Kurt and himself. 3. A credit card was reported to have been used after his death. 4. The weapon didn't have any usable fingerprints on it.
1390	I think "that's what she said" is better, because "yo mama" is just your mom, and "that's what she said" isn't around as much as "yo mama," but it's just as smart. "That's what she said" fits with everything, and it's a good laugh every once in a while, and it's not an insult to people's actual moms, which is what "yo mama" is. Of course, there's been a show on MTV called "Your Mama" that was a major success on both MTV and MTV2, but the show is just a bunch of retarded people making stupid jokes about each other's moms, and they're all different, but "That's What She Said" can be said about anything, and it's more entertaining than "Yo Mama." That's all I've got.
1391	The United States can't do anything about it, because China stands right behind North Korea, so any move you make, they'll counteract. All you have to do is hope the Chinese will talk sense into them, because there's no more westernized communist nation than China. Sanctions only hurt innocent people, they don't stop the leaders. Perhaps if they would have armed Japan with nuclear weapons, they would have been able to fight North Korea and buffered it, who knows.
1392	Everyone has a right to have an opinion, to be frank about it, to express his or her own thoughts loudly, logical or not, you also have a right to listen to that person or not, to offer your own ideas and opinions or simply to ignore him, as if he did not exist (of course, if his ideas are not logical or acceptable)... It is a form of oppression to tell people how they should think and express themselves.
1393	Pascal's wager isn't the most persuasive argument in favor of Christian faith, actually, I wouldn't call it an argument at all. It's logically correct, but it doesn't really provide any good reasons for faith. It's just a way of convincing people to believe. If Christianity is real, then Pascal's wager is great. If Christianity is real, then it's a great bet to put your eternity in it. But I wouldn't use that wager.
1394	Euthanasia is a painless way to end a patient's life with happiness, for both him and his family. Euthanasia is a way to end a life of immense pain, rather than waking up every morning hoping that tomorrow will not come.
1395	Trapper's a pretender, a fool who ran when it was right, and BJ was with Hawkeye all the way. When the war dragged on and Hawkeye's mind started to deteriorate, did Trapper call to see how they were? No, but BJ was a delight to his friends with home movies of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and performing surgeries while Hawkeye was seeing chickens on buses.
1396	I've learned from the "convinceme" debates that living cells in a mother's womb, even if they have human DNA distinct from their mother, isn't life. The fact that the unborn may have a heartbeat and human DNA distinct from their mother doesn't mean they aren't life. The fact that the unborn may have a blood type distinct from their mother, does have human DNA, and all cells are replicating and living...doesn't make them life. If the unborn can't have a blood type distinct from their mother, does have human DNA, and all cells are replicating and living...doesn't make them life. If the unborn can't have a face, eyes, nose, reproductive organs, and all the other things that make people life...doesn't make them life. If the unborn can't have any of those things that make people life...doesn't make them life. If the unborn can't have any of those things that make them life...doesn't make them life. If the unborn can't have any of those things that make them life...doesn't make them life. If the unborn can't have any of those things that make them life...doesn't make them life.
1397	I'm not sure what the name of the device or the process is, but you wear a device outside your ear that picks up sound, and sends it to a device that is implanted into your brain, which then uses a bunch of neurons, impulses, and electrical things to "scientific term" to "learn" to hear sound. It's not perfect, and takes months for your brain to "learn" to hear, but many deaf people have this surgery. They are working on something similar for the eyes, but it's a lot more complicated, since the eye has so many nerve endings and connections.
1398	The debate is based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence in favor of creationism, while there is a massive amount in favor of evolution.
1399	The Cold War is over, the USSR is gone, the Berlin Wall isn't there, we're trading with China and other socialist, communist, or dictatorship countries. There are many American farms and businesses that want to trade with Cuba, which will help open up Cuban society as American business takes hold on the island, along with increased tourism, which will make it easier for Americans to talk to Cubans. It's obvious that the current policy isn't working, 48 years of no change is proof, a new policy should be developed, why go on with the same old, same old, no change? Jon Jax 71
1400	I agree, that is a bit much, and in addition to that religious aspect, I think we should not have it sung in school at all. School is supposed to be an objective learning atmosphere, and introducing peer-reinforced patriotism and religious bias has no place in an atmosphere meant to accommodate students of all backgrounds and religions. It seems to me, when I think back on my early school days, that it was a bit like indoctrination, so I support, at a minimum, removing religious references in order to accommodate all religious beliefs, the only way to do that is to have a secular POA (I don't support any atheistic references either btw :P). Additionally, I think issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
1401	I think the worst problem is that debaters spend a lot of time debating trivial things, like misspellings. We all do it from time to time, don't we? I could go on and on about how ridiculous it is to make that comment, after all, how could posters be illiterates if they can read and write? The person who created the debate obviously doesn't understand that, even if it was just an attempt at sarcasm, but what's the point?
1402	Jon Stewart's got a much more sophisticated sense of humor, and he's always covering more significant topics. He's always got great interviews, and his special reporters are great, too. Stephen relies too much on gimmicks, and his humor is less sophisticated. The whole arrogant facade he wears can be irritating, and he's not really as funny as Stewart.
1403	You're saying that you get your news from "Fox News" and nothing else, they make false statements (like describing a congressman who was a sexual predator as a democrat), and they never correct them. Now you believe that the sexual predator was a democrat congressman, your reality has been altered. But that's just a factual reality that can be easily corrected, I suppose the question meant as in making a person schitzophrenic or dillusional,
1404	This is the first time I've ever given a full review of a chain restaurant, but I've been to this location four times since opening, and the staff has always been extremely polite and cheerful, the chicken has been fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits have been perfect, and the dirty rice has been outstanding. I've even tried the Cajun tenders, and unlike most places where any boneless chicken is as heavily spiced as the box in which it arrives, the tenders here are really hot, so make sure you get the "mild" ones for the kids. I'll be taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and I'm considering picking up a large box of bird to share with the teachers...
1405	I was on a business trip to Phoenix and decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The place was horrible from the start. The hostess was extremely unfriendly and looked like she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down, a couple of bugs fell from the ceiling onto the table--I should have gotten up then. The chips were greasy, margaritas were just sugar and very little liquor, and the enchiladas were just bland. In addition, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom. You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant. It should have been closed down right away for its lack of cleanliness and poorly prepared food.
1406	I will never return to this place again because the food is not only disgusting but the service is also terrible. After I placed my order, I noticed that there was no cheese on the burger and that the fries were just ordinary. I originally wanted to go to Burger King, but the gate was closed in front of me.
1407	We came here to celebrate my husband's promotion. We had wonderful service and wonderful food. I had steak Diane and salmon, and my husband had shrimp and chicken Alfredo. I chose to write this review because we witnessed the staff's kindness to a woman who had a visual impairment. Her waiter literally read her the majority of the menu until she found something she wanted. She was patient and attentive.
1408	We had the Margherita pizza and the Diavola pizza and they were both amazing. We've been to Naples and had pizza there and this pizza at Inizio is the closest to that we've found in America. The sauce is amazing! The restaurant is really well decorated and has a great atmosphere and we loved the tables. The staff was also super friendly. We loved everything; we will definitely be back!
1409	I'm giving it 4 stars because I hope management is reading these reviews because most people are right about what they need. Needs: better customer service training for your staff, better lighting for nighttime sports, more seats. These are simple things that will kill this place if they aren't fixed.
1410	I'm personally very fond of Jardin Panos. It's not a special place, it's just your average Greek restaurant, like Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. If you're looking for some authentic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, salad, rice, and tzaziki, go for it. The food is consistently good. In a world full of mystery meat, Panos will always provide average food. The terrasse is very nice. As with many people in the area, it's more of a summer destination than a winter destination.
1411	It's just an experience, actually, I'm not gay, but all the kids at my high school are trying to get signatures on a petition to change their uniforms.
1412	The lack of individuality of children through the uniformity of school clothing is another reason against school uniforms. The emphasis on the uniformity of school clothing is contrary to the idea that there is unity among diversity and that it should be celebrated.
1413	Kids don't wanna wear the same clothes every day, I know I'd hate that.
1414	Personally, I think school uniforms are a bad idea. People are always telling us to be ourselves and show who we really are, but we can't do that when we're wearing this stupid uniform to school!
1415	I'm not sure keeping restrictions is a good idea, because students, especially teenagers, will be more hungry for fashion, and it's better to feed them than keep them hungry. And when they get out of these restrictions, we'll see another side of them, which is much worse, with no morals. So let people be free to be themselves, rather than stopping them.
1416	I would say you are a fanatical zealot fanboy.
1417	Mozilla Firefox is superior to Internet Explorer because it informs you that pop-ups are blocked, and it automatically updates the old version with the Google Toolbar and it downloads very fast.
1418	When running multiple tabs, Internet Explorer uses a lot of memory, more than Firefox, probably even more; it could start multiple instances of SVCHOST.exe and use them as blinds.
1419	I'm just saying, "Don't confide in your spouse and say you killed somebody; they'll get you!" And if they find out on their own, get them out before they get you!"
1420	While TV has its advantages, books are more effective in general for learning, because you have to concentrate more.
1421	Television's pretty much like a book, the only difference is that in books you actually have to move your eyes.
1422	The Americans fought the British for independence, and every time they saw a British soldier, they'd scream, "The redcoats are coming, the redcoats are coming." And if India ever tried to takeover the U.S., Americans would have to scream, "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming."
1423	I'd rather be without a father than have a bad one who's a stain on my life. I wouldn't look up to him, and he doesn't necessarily have to be the dad I should be looking up to.
1424	I'd rather be "fatherless" than have a "bad father", because a "father" is supposed to be the head of the household, and a good example, so that other family members can look up to him. If I look up to a bad father, I might be a bad person, but if I don't have a father, then I'll set the standards for myself, and rise to be the head of the household, especially if I have younger siblings or brothers.
1425	I'd say it's better to not have a father than a bad father. You still lose in that case. When you've got a dad, you want him to be the best he can be, so you can learn from him when you grow up. If you've got a bad dad, then what's the point of having a dad at all? He's just going to be a bad dad, and he won't teach you anything. It's always better to have a decent dad in your life than a bad dad.
1426	The treaty with Sultan Hussein was signed by Raffles, not Farquhar, who was only a subordinate of his.
1427	The treaty of Singapore is signed by Raffles, Sultan Hussein and Temenggong, with the commander of the Temenggong accompanying the event on seven ships.
1428	How is it that evolution is real, and humankind isn't evolving at all? And, for those of you with religion, how is Adam and Eve the earliest people to live on this planet, the 'parents' of humanity? In Arabic, man is 'bani adam', which literally means Adam's clan.
1429	From a casual Internet user, I prefer IE because it's more elegant and simpler to manage bookmarks and history. But I use Firefox because my brother set it as my default browser, so I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again.
1430	Kids are overweight now, p.e. helps, and they'll learn that health is vital to their future, which isn't very bright.
1431	I'd say it should be mandatory, kids on the street are most likely overweight because they eat too much and don't exercise enough.
1432	Farquhar had done all the groundwork for Singapore's improvement, while Raffles had only dreamed about it.
1433	Singapore would have been destroyed without William Farquhar, only because William was there to rule Singapore. Raffles had gone to govern another country.
1434	You're not familiar with the stories of these girls, so who are you to say what they can or cannot do? If you haven't walked a mile in their shoes, then perhaps you can speak on their behalf. Perhaps you won't like it, and you can stand by your opinion, but at least you'll have the courage to respect other people's opinions on this matter.
1435	You can see evolution in action. Fruit flies are great for this experiment because they reproduce, live and die so fast. You need to understand that evolution is caused by mutations which allow the creature to survive because those mutations allow it to survive more easily than other creatures. i.e. natural selection. Speciation is another example of evolution... different species are created because they have adapted to a slightly different environment. If you watch, you can see evolution in action.
1436	We were created by magic in a couple of days, or was it the result of billions of years of evolution?
1437	It's impossible not to have evolution. The weak die, the strong live on, this strengthens the species. Argument over. However, creationism and evolution are not mutually exclusive. I do not believe in a god simply because of the incredible low probability that there is a god or gods.
1438	I'm not saying that porn is a good way to live, but I'm betting all the people who say yes to the argument that porn is bad are virgins.
1439	No, porn isn't bad. Maybe some people think it's bad, but it's not. If there wasn't porn and sex, how would we have kids?
1440	Providing the common good is a better goal than personal ambitions. For example, there are people who wish to assist others. Personal ambitions are only for selfish people who care only about themselves.
1441	I'd choose the personal interest, because I know that if I don't go to college after high school, then I won't ever go, so I'd go for personal interest.
1442	I'm sure everyone has a little feeling for the greater good, but I think most people think they're more important than anyone else in the world.
1443	I'm in favor of uniforms, but only to a point. I went to school with a uniform, and it made me feel much less stressed than a non-uniform college. I would argue that it's a leveler, keeping people from bragging about their material wealth and making others feel bad about not having nice things. But it can go too far. In my last year, we were not allowed colored socks, which was ridiculous.
1444	It's good to obey the rules of the school, and it's right to express emotions, but it's not necessary, because we're at school to learn.
1445	I'm really for uniforms, and I think they're good for schools, and they should be school uniforms. You don't have to constantly worry about what you'll wear every morning, and in that time, you'll do something important that will help you in school. It might be a bit boring to wear the same clothes every day, but it's cheaper and you don't have to go shopping so often.
1446	I'd say this is a great idea, because uniforms make students equal in terms of money, which can prevent envy and jealousy.
1447	It's better to have a bad father than no father, because you can learn from his mistakes and avoid them. It's also bad for you and your mother, because you don't have any role models or anyone to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your dad to help you out, even if he's bad.
1448	I'm sure it's better to have a bad father than no father, and I know how it feels to not have one, so it's better for me to have a bad father than no father at all.
1449	It is costly, wasteful, and diverts attention from the most important public health issue: the construction and maintenance of safe city water systems.
1450	Water bottles are bad, because they pollute the water and some people sell water bottles with bacteria in them, depending on where they get their water from. Water bottles are also more expensive than regular water. Water systems are aging and there are hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.
1451	Can anybody tell me why TV has some advantages over books, because we've been having a debate in school? Can anyone help me?
1452	When we're in recession, why would we ban a product that over a million people are buying?
1453	If the world's most interesting man doesn't drink Dos Equis, he's drinking bottled water.
1454	I'm not sure what you guys think, but water bottles are so handy when I'm on the beach on a hot summer's day, and I'm dehydrated, and my only option for water is the ocean, which I wouldn't drink from, I have two choices: pass out from heat and dehydration, and waste the rest of the day sick or in the hospital, or drink from a water bottle.
1455	I'm sorry I threw that last comment in the wrong direction.
1456	Of course it's wrong. Why do you think there's an aids?
1457	Is it all about love, or is it not? If it was only love, then I could marry my dog, and two kids from the local middle school could get married. It's not just love.
1458	I think (and this is a wild guess) that the original argument the man was trying to make was that unprotected sex can increase the likelihood of transmission of the virus. It might be true, but if it is, it has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people in question.
1459	I'm not proposing "separate but equal," I'm proposing "distinct and different." Male/female relationships have a very different impact on the whole than male/male or female/female relationships. If the law is to consider them intelligently, it must be capable of separating them. A law mandating separate schools and public accommodations for homosexuals would violate "separate but equal," but a law defining marriage as a male/female relationship would not.
1460	India's potential to lead the world is real, if the Indian government can take care of a country of 28 states, 28 cultures, 28 geography, 28 languages, it'll definitely succeed.
1461	I am a Christian, and I am very religious, but if this argument is the criterion, I'll go atheism. God isn't a Christian.
1462	If God loves everybody, then why does he hate homosexuals? The Bible's just a book, have you ever wondered whether the cardinal who translated it changed some of its details to make "god" seem nicer?
1463	After the spanking, I made sure I never did it again to avoid punishment, because the second time's always worse, because you've already been told not to.
1464	I think parents should use spanking as a way of disciplining their children, but there's a limit to everything, so they shouldn't use it every time their kids do something wrong.
1465	Even if I'm acting like an atheist, I'm not forgetting the principles and practices of Christian faith; as this debate intensifies, it's more appropriate to conclude that this current trend of atheism isn't really gaining ground, and it'd be a disgrace to hide our religion and claim to support atheism.
1466	You'd rather die believing in a god, than not believing and finding out he exists!
1467	Because spanking comes mainly from anger, and can be for something other than what your kid did, like if someone else made them mad, then they let it all out on them.
1468	I don't think parents should hit their kids, there are other ways of getting kids to behave.
1469	It's unnecessary, and it's also completely unrelated to how a child develops into an adult.
1470	You're stealing a candy bar from school, then your parents steal your favorite toy. The same thing happens here. You hit someone, then you're told not to hit someone, then you're told not to hit, then the same person hits you.
1471	I'd turn them in, because that's crazy. Why would you kill someone? Anyone who does that crime will be punished, no matter who you are or what you mean to me. I'd definitely turn them in. If you help him, you can be in jail for that crime, too, and I don't want to be in jail.
1472	Yes, I'd report them if someone I loved and lived with murdered someone. Murder is premedicated and deliberate, so you never know if they'll turn on you later.
1473	I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say, I'd have to say,
1474	After watching cops and cold case files a lot, the guy that's always in the murders, or is an associate, or whatever, is always caught. I don't wanna be that guy. I don't wanna be an associate. And if my wife kills somebody, she's too insane for me, so I break up with her.
1475	I'd say I'd most likely turn my husband in, because I wouldn't want to be married to a murderer. And if he killed somebody else, then who knows if he's going to attack me again? Obviously he's not in his right mind if he's killed somebody else, and I wouldn't want to live with him for ever.
1476	Sport shouldn't be compulsory, so kids get bullied at school because they're fatter or less fit, so bullies pick their victims every day at school, so all you guys who support this are wrong!
1477	I'm at school and P.E. just makes kids unhappy,lots of people are sad because they're picked last,they can't play,like,example:I hate my P.E. class and hate that I'm always picked last for teams,that's not nice,and not just overweight kids,there are plenty of overweight adults who do P.E. and they don't help anything.
1478	In eighth grade, physical education should be optional, and if students choose to participate, that's fine. However, there are many things going on in eighth grade, and that time could be better spent studying.
1479	The minimum number of characters for an argument is 50, with the purpose of reducing the number of stupid jokes to maintain the highest quality of discussion and debate.
1480	It's just too tiring, so it's not mandatory to go to physical education.The minimum length of an argument is 50 characters, which is intended to reduce the number of stupid jokes so that we can maintain the best quality of discussion and debate.
1481	Some kids, for example, are already in sports, and they're training hard.
1482	I'm not comfortable with the idea of requiring more physical education. First, I don't think it's the college's responsibility to force students to exercise. I believe students are responsible for their own choice of whether or not to exercise. Additionally, I believe there should be no physical education requirement at all. In my opinion, college is a place to train our brains, not our bodies. I add that if students need physical exercise, they can exercise on their own, like I do when I go hiking or play basketball in my neighborhood.
1483	It's easier to help yourself than to help others, and not everybody wants to be helped. Your needs are more important than other people's, so you must focus on yourself first. In this world, you must fight for what you want.
1484	In my opinion, if you don't help yourself, no one else can help you. If you try to help everyone who needs your help, you'll just get in a rut. Don't get me wrong, helping people is always the right thing to do. But in the grand scheme of things, when you pursue your dreams, get wealthy, famous, and powerful, you can help the people who matter to you.
1485	I'm convinced that human nature is to pursue things for himself, not for others.
1486	The guy who threw the cup away is out right away. The guy who helped lower the rim of the cup should not have a leg to stand on, unless the cup finder agreed to that. If your neighbor asked you to pick him up at the gas station and buy beer, cigarettes and lottery tickets, do you deserve half the winnings? No. So I'd say the cup finder does.
1487	You need to try to get the money. The hospital bills can be paid in full by the hospital's billing department, all you need to do is write a letter stating you can't pay the bill and most hospitals will clear the account. That's most hospitals, not all will, but it's worth it. If you don't have the means to pay for it, then you don't. My father just died and he didn't even have a toilet to use. I thought when I went to the viewing they'd try to get me..but they didn't, cause most states (if you look into it more) will give you so much to bury them in the ground. My state here in Ohio gave my father $6000.00 for his. They have to do something with the funds for tax write off reasons. So call Legal Aide in your state and see what they say.
1488	It's true that forgiveness is a virtue of Christianity, but one shouldn't suffer because of someone else's bad decision. If you're going to sue, make sure you get exactly what you're owed, and keep receipts for everything. It's not unethical to sue if you're only doing it for the right amount, and not for greed.
1489	You have the right to ask for sole custody if you feel that he is causing her more harm than good by being involved. It may be difficult to prove, especially if visitation has never been ordered. In my opinion, the judge would order specific days for visitation first. If he does not follow the visitation times, the judge will assume that he is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. Again, this may take some time. As for child support, absolutely. He will be subject to back child support from the day she is born unless he can prove that he is paying. You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filling out child support payment/custody documents. It is not hard to fill out and they will assist you in doing them. The more information you have about your daughter's father the better, i.e. job information, social security, driver's license, address, etc.
1490	Yes, weed has a much smaller effect on alcohol, and if it was legal, it would free up a lot of space in our prisons, where they are being held for non-violent crimes, and I think it would make people less likely to use harder drugs, and people who need it for medical reasons wouldn't have to deal with all the garbage they have to deal with now!
1491	I'm not sure I understand your question. Petitions are legal. You can make a petition about almost anything, and get many people to sign it, via email or otherwise. However, a petition is not a "legal document" in the sense that it says that a certain number of people have taken a certain position and are requesting that some sort of action be taken on their behalf. For example, you can make a petition to ban smoking, but simply because you get many people to sign it does not mean that smoking will be banned. However, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it, if it is in his/her best political interest to do so. So the answer is yes.
1492	No, God has never said that looking at a nude woman is against the law. However, in Matthew, Jesus says, in relation to adultery, that if you think about lusting after a woman, then you are as guilty of that as if you had sex with her. So, no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a great idea either.
1493	Ethically, if your father's insurance is going to go up, you should pay it. It will probably be reviewed within six months. However, the good news is that this is just life's lessons learned. You got a ticket for improper driving, no problem. She got a ticket because she was at least half the fault. Let's assume there's a big medical bill. You're probably insured on your father's policy had you been at fault. Your friend has the problem and is completely at fault. He let you use the car. Now, if there's a claim, he's not insured because he didn't list you as a separate driver, and he may have to pay out of pocket. This is his fault, not yours. I don't see this as an ethical problem for you because you're insured.
1494	I'm sure that must have hurt you very badly. I can't imagine that you're keeping someone you love from someone you love. But I don't think you are. If he wasn't worried, I wouldn't be. His boss must have realized that gays, interracial couples, lesbians, and most relationships are commonplace. I'm sure if he keeps pushing your boyfriend, he'll decide to go to another firm rather than lose you. Good luck.
1495	I've just been to a lecture yesterday on these statistics. The crime rate is falling, but the number of people in jail is rising. This is due to the US' "War on Crime" and "War on Drugs" begun in the late seventies and early eighties, primarily Reagan. We are taking action and using jail as a response. To really analyze these numbers, you need to take into account the crime rate of all these nations (we score very badly there, too), and the statistics on African Americans are even worse. Something like 6,000+ African American prisoners per 100,000.
1496	You don't have to record your FST, and since most police cars don't have cameras, I don't think they've "forgotten" to record your FST. Your license is over, and the police will testify about how you did. If you thought you weren't drunk, you should have taken a breathalyzer. But, in general, people don't make good decisions when they're drunk.
1497	I'm sorry to say that this isn't a good legal ground for a lawsuit. You'll never find an attorney who will accept this case without fee, so if you really want to pursue it, you'll have to pay for it yourself, which will be incredibly expensive. If your reputation wasn't damaged, then I would say talk to him, his boss, etc. and let it go.
1498	Don't let them do this. A person listed as "payable on death" has no interest in your account while you're alive. They get all your assets when you die, they're not responsible for any liabilities -- certainly not while you're alive. Let them know you're going to hire an attorney if they don't change their tune -- and that it will cost them a whole lot more than $800. A bank stealing money from innocent children? Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.
1499	It's very hard to get sole custody. You have to PROVE that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail sounds bad, but since she's in jail, she can't do anything harm. (In court's perspective) Fighting this will be difficult. You would be better off trying to change visitation. Try to get it that it has to be supervised. I would go talk to a lawyer. First consultation is usually free. (and custody battles can be expensive)
1500	I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy,but based on the mental condition of your neighbor's son,the courts should have a way of compensating you for the damage.If he's been evaluated by a professional and the results are okay,you can charge for simple assault.If not,you can still charge,because in the end,the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damage caused by him.I suggest you talk to your police chief,explain what happened and what you want done,and if he doesn't help,go up the chain until you resolve the issue.Bullying is no excuse.
1501	If you bought the dog in Florida, and you lived here for over a year, then the court there has jurisdiction. You can hire an attorney to file a complaint here in Florida, and then serve her with papers in Cali. If the dog is registered to you, I don't see an issue with you getting the dog back. Good luck, and take care of yourself.
1502	I'm 31 years old, mother of 2 girls, and health teacher. I'd definitely vote to bring back the age of drinking to 18.
1503	I'm not sure you mean Latinos as a whole, or just some specific group. I know many people who were born south of the U.S., speak Spanish, so when they start speaking English, they may have a similar accent. But let me tell you, not all "latinos" are alike. Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans aren't like other Latin American countries. You wouldn't say to an Irishman, "He's British", or Canadian, "He's American", or Basque, "He's Spanish". Culture shouldn't be an excuse for bad behavior, when you get into another country, you should learn its customs and traditions. To say, "I do this or that because of my culture" is just a poor excuse.
1504	The only drawback to this punishment is that it doesn't remove the criminal's mentality, so he'll still think the same thing. Maybe this combination of frontal lobotomy and castration will be enough, but I don't think any state will allow it. I'd rather go with the two strikes and your shot, plus, bullets are so much less expensive than surgery.
1505	Is this your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you just think of this on your own? Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social "harmony" or "balance." Therefore, we cannot dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what social harmony or balance is. This process of defining social harmony and balance is socially cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is. In other words, the process of accepting and agreeing on laws, customs, or religion is socially cohesive. The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabilitation of the criminal, so that he can successfully reintegrate into society.
1506	The worst part is that there are still many innocent people who are displaced, looking for work (which our state doesn't have because of the economy and crime), and have no permanent place to live.
1507	I don't know about the statistics, but I think people lie all the time. People are either honest or dishonest. I don't think that swearing to tell the truth will automatically make a dishonest person tell the truth. It just means that if they don't tell the truth when they swear, then it's illegal. And hey, if they are already on trial for something illegal, it's probably not going to bother them if they do something else that's illegal.
1508	Yes, fight for your rights, don't have sex with him, charge him, just kidding, just needed to say that at the moment, the most important thing is, of course, the children's welfare, documentation, documentation, I hope you've got documents for everything that happened in your life, witnesses, he must pay child support, no matter what, he's their father and must support them (whether he wants to or not, wage garnishment), don't question yourself if you need financial assistance, you do, and you're worthy of it. Good luck, and I hope everything works out for you and your kids.
1509	I think you're too fat when you can't move to get something or do something yourself, or it's very difficult for you. My dad weighs 600 lbs and he can't walk anymore, but it's not a crime, although it's one of the 7 deadly sins in the Bible called "glutiny", no one else can be held responsible for someone eating themselves to death. cause even if someone else is feeding them, they pretty much have to feed them till they're full, or it won't let them rest at all. p.s. I'm a big guy, too, but I can do everything anyone else does with a lot of ease. I work at a factory and work 12 and 16 hours a day and can't lose weight for the life of me, I don't consume that much food. Some people are naturally heavy, and those are the most misunderstood.
1510	It's not like it's my house and my only child is dead on the floor and I find out my beautiful wife has been raped and then when I walk into a room and he drops his knife and says he's giving up because I have a gun. You're right, he's going straight to hell that night. Why should it be any different if he's caught a few months later?
1511	This is not an easy question to answer, because in most states there is no single answer. Generally speaking, a parent may use "reasonable force" to discipline a minor child, but what is "reasonable" in any given situation may be quite different. For example, using force would be more reasonable when an older child is in danger of serious harm to a younger child, than when he was simply late for dinner.
1512	Murder, fraud, robbery, rape, smoking marijuana is against the law, and just because millions of people do it, doesn't mean it's okay. Millions of people all over the world supported the September 11th attacks, does that make them right?
1513	You know, people these days are too preoccupied to see what's happening around the world. I may not know everything, but I think people are just too dumb to just watch what Bushy (please don't sue me for calling him Bushy, I like the name like that)here is doing. Also, people are sometimes too poor to buy their own TV or even a newspaper, or they're just too lazy too, because of taxes, gas prices, and all of their stupid friends! Now, this is my opinion, you might not like it, but deal with it.
1514	Pro. Once a murderer is executed, he will never run away or hurt anyone else. It hurts the heart and mind of victims' families that their loved ones will never see another holiday, birthday, or even another day while their murderer is still alive. It's a relief to the families. There's something intrinsically fair about execution.
1515	Your question should be, "Why does every country that bans guns see an increase in personal crimes and burglaries?" Or, "Since some countries have banned guns and seen an increase in crime, why do their governments not reinstate their gun rights so their citizens can protect themselves?" See how that is more diplomatic, and more inviting to intelligent discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hositlity and open biases into it.
1516	Here are some suggestions: 1. Don't cover his hatemongering in the daily news. The whole reason this "church" is still going is because of the publicity. Complain to TV stations that are airing it. 2. If you're at a funeral or event where they're present, tell them how much their actions hurt and offend you, or stand in front of them with your back to them. You have the right to do this under the First Amendment, just like they do. 3. Support organizations, such as PFLAG, who work against discrimination, bigotry and homophobia. Support the same causes yourself. I tried to limit my answer to things an individual can do, vs. staging a counterdemonstration and other things that require a lot of people and money. Thanks for your thoughtful question.
1517	I'm still not sure why smoking is banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Nonsmokers have their own nonsmoking areas with fans, but I guess not. People just want to tell other people what they can do so they can get what they want. If nonsmokers' rights are allegedly violated, they will, and they do. What about smokers' rights?
1518	I think that's why the world is watching us make a mess, and see how we try to fix it, but Bush will never admit it was a horrible mistake to go there & start this war. Maybe on his deathbed he would have. I agree though, that if all the world had helped, the insurgents & terrorists would have been eliminated, but that won't happen, because I would guess 90% of the world hates us, especially now.
1519	If someone wants to be racist, let him be racist. There's worse things a person can be.
1520	If you asked me personally, I'd say it's pathetic that you want to sue a bar because you were arrested for public intoxication. What did they do? Put you on the ground, poured tequila into your throat, turned you into a bitch? I'd love to be on that jury, someday I hope you'll take personal responsibility.
1521	I think it's okay for the government to do that, for instance, if someone's actions are bad for someone else or a group of people. government is working for us as a whole, not just for each person. we have certain freedoms and can do most things the way we like, but there are limits. if it's the best way to protect society by restricting one person's freedoms, then the government should be allowed to do that.
1522	I'm trying to find something positive about this decade. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful for food, shelter, and a decent job, but I find that there's not much to be positive about.
1523	In practical terms, our basic needs are pretty much nutrition and water. Everything in society, like wealth, income, education, etc., is just there to give our lives meaning. They don't exist in the real world. Hunters andgatherers don't need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their lives. All right, maybe they live shorter, but that doesn't matter. There's no philosophical explanation for why life has to be long. The fact is, we, civilians, have to create allusions to make our lives satisfactory.
1524	I don't understand why people with a history degree are doing anything but teaching or writing history, which isn't much more than a pleasure to read, and I don't think it should be regarded as a scientific subject.
1525	It'll probably be a Dodge Charger or a Crown Victoria if we stay here for another 11-12 years. It'll have a roof rack that looks like their siren lights, a spotlight on the driver's side, a ram-cage on the front, and maybe some numbers on the rear, or even on the side. I don't think writing something like "POLICE" on the side would be too far, but I'll make sure I put on all I can. We don't live in a dangerous city or area, and we never plan to go near one, so I don't see him being taunted by people who want to have fun with him. I think he'll intimidate every neighborhood he goes to, and people will drive carefully and slowly around him.
1526	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times in a row, less than 2 minutes from my dorm, I've been threatened with violence. Once, I managed to show a knife, once I got away, and the last time, I was lucky to be saved by campus police. I believe that every college campus should be forced to allow campus carry, no matter what the dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying, but statistics have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without licenses.
1527	As simple as that may sound, from a socioeconomic point of view, mainstream activist feminism (with the exception of Tumblr feminism) is beginning to look like a group of upper-middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their everyday behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched. Some women writing with a feminist bent (particularly movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in their work. While I support the basic concept of feminism (all human beings should be treated equally regardless of gender), I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. The comments of construction workers don't determine the wage of women, or their ability to participate in American economic or political life, but the actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do. So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices? Why do street harassment and terms of address merit more attention than institutional discrimination?
1528	I know that the frontmen of the 90's grunge bands weren't necessarily trying to sell themselves as sexual objects, but I'm sure they were reacting to things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP), which were conscious that their bands were selling men as sexual objects. So let's take a look at the frontmen: Kurt Cobain: good looking, blonde,blue eyes, looks like his uncle Eddie Vedder: definitely more attractive than the average guy Scott Weiland: in his pre-anorex days a very good looking guy Chris Cornell: I'm not sure, do you think he's attractive to women? Ladies? Layne Staley: I think she's the least bad looking, but I don't think she's the worst. All of them were great musicians, no doubt, but was it just a coincidence that the frontmen of the bands that became big had pretty or attractive ones? I mean, even outside of grunge, have you seen the younger pictures of Michael Stipe?
1529	I saw the Spider-Man movies when I was about six and saw nothing bad about them. When I watched them again 10 years later I thought maybe Toby was a bit mopey, but I didn't understand why there was so much anger toward the actor. He was decent in the great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? People on the internet constantly complain about his various faces, but I've only noticed one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please elaborate as much as you can on this subject, please and thank you.
1530	I'll add some arguments here, but please don't feel obligated to address them point by point. There's plenty of stuff I've probably missed/gotten 1. With the advent of Constantly Variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts - even well driven ones - no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy. 2. The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety. 3. The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term. 4. They are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. 5. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys. 6. They divert the driver's attention away from the road as he concentrates on selecting the optimal gear. 7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving. Please CMV.
1531	I will explain how I came to this conclusion: I was at my company's office when a restricted phone number called me. I answered it, and before I could say anything but "hello," I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person. Then, a famous politician began to bombard me with buzzwords that were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (I'm not well-versed in law though). I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for. I could write more of my opinion, but I really want to be wrong. Thanks.
1532	First, the numbers: Arizona Iced Tea lemon flavor has 24 grams of sugar per 8 ounces. Coca-Cola Classic has 27 grams. Pepsi has 28 grams. First, the ingredients are basically the same: water and high fructose corn syrup. Arizona's flavor is mostly from tea leaves, while Coke's is from flavoring. They both stain teeth, Coke has caramel color while Arizona's is from tea leaves again. I like both drinks, but I think they're both pretty bad now and should only be used in moderation.
1533	I read that America spends three times more on students with disabilities than normal students in school. It amazes me that these students, at least in New York, get one or two teachers who personally teach them, and lots of new, hightech equipment in their classrooms, while many needy schools don't even have laptops, while students with disabilities each have their own tablets. I believe the system for students with disabilities needs serious reform, but if anyone can refute that, I'm open to new ideas.
1534	I see that they want independence, but they also want to stay in NATO and the UN, they want to keep the pound, and all the infrastructure that we've built up, such as the NHS, the military, the police, the fire brigade, etc. My opinion at the moment is that if they vote for independence, they should get full independence. A complete and immediate cessation of all funding from the UK government to Scotland and Scottish nationals, immigration controls, them not being allowed to use the pound, be expelled from the UN/NATO (and have to reapply to join if they want to), the immediate withdrawal of the National Health Service and other services such as the British Police, Fire Service and the Army. At the moment they seem to be like petulant kids that are biting the hand that feeds them. Of course, if this is wrong I would love to be corrected. I'm not interested in being wilfully ignorant.
1535	I've seen a meme recently where protesters in London poured concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes, and the comments were all positive, rather than criticizing the protesters for property destruction. In my opinion, Tesco is acting rationally, and these protesters are nothing but ordinary thugs who should be charged with property destruction and should be required to pay the costs they incurred. I don't see a problem with the spikes if they're used to protect their customers.
1536	I am generally against capital punishment for moral reasons, for almost any reason other than crimes against humanity, because I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity as a whole. I don't believe capital punishment is moral in the case of murder or rape, for example, in almost every case. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion, and I'm willing to change my mind. But I'm hoping to hear something new, and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.
1537	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" is whether or not you believe that a woman should have the option of terminating her pregnancy. If you believe that this choice should be legal, you are not advocating abortion (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they are a good act). One can hold the position that abortion is morally wrong, and still believe that the decision should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be against abortion and still advocate the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc. CMV!
1538	I'm completely opposed to pirating content online. Most people think it's harmless, since you're stealing from big companies like Fox or EA, but they're just producers, not the real companies that created the content and earned money by working hard. Piratebay doesn't even try to hide that its main purpose is to distribute torrent files of copyrighted content. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his role in both creating the site and developing methods to make it harder to remove it is entirely justified.
1539	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "Your Honor," or "Captain." In certain situations it is considered disrespectful not to refer to a person by their honorifics. However, it is my opinion that nobility NEVER deserves to be referred to by their honorifics/titles (King, Queen, majesty, Prince, etc.). Why? Because (1) nobility is completely unearned. Nobility is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns his title, a duke does not. (2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society. These two reasons remove all obligation to refer to nobility by their honorifics in any social context.
1540	It's not that our generation values money more than people, it's just that our generation has learned from its past that people aren't forever. People die, they get married, they change, and most importantly, they can't always be there for you. Point blank. And when that happens, all you have is yourself, your goals, your hobbies, your interests, and your passions to keep you going. But, goals, hobbies, and interests have a cost, and you'd better be making enough to do what you enjoy most, because being lonely and broke is worse than being lonely but making enough to see the movies you want to see, and take the trips you want to take. You have to make enough to keep your life going, so you don't end up stuck in the past.
1541	Opera is wonderfull. It has all the nicest features of a browser, but it's the least known. For example, "Speed dial" puts your 9 most used bookmarks on the screen when you create a new blank tab. It also has many addons, but the community is just beginning. Also, it was recently rated very highly in CPU Magazine, with its only fault being that it doesn't have enough addons, which is increasing. Opera will release a new version of the browser, 9.52, which will have many improvements, including faster performance than any of its competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently people were willing to pay for it.
1542	While I believe that baseball and football are deeply rooted in American history, I believe baseball is America's most popular sport, and that's what all sports are trying to achieve. That kind of popularity, or attention to one particular thing is what brings people together, and baseball is definitely America's favorite sport, or at least that's what I believe.
1543	I'm as interested in this as I am in the ordinary flu, which is to say "nothing." As usual, simple precautions such as washing hands regularly (with no antibacterial soap, please!), sneezing into tissues or handkerchiefs, and simply staying at home when you're sick, will make a big difference in stopping this "epidemic."
1544	It is not possible to argue against that, since it is simply a fact that they have made that statement. Whether or not they would have carried out bombings and attacks on US interests in the Mideast and elsewhere is easier to argue against, since the US supports Israel and interferes with Mideast politics.
1545	I'm sorry for all the Giants fans, but I think the Eagles won this season 23-11, or maybe I'm just forgetting. Plus, with Brian Westbrook and Donovan McNabb being healthy, and their helpers such as Desean Jackson and Kevin Curtis, the offense will not be stopped next season. Also, with their dominant defense, with people such as Asante Samuel and their new additions, it will be like pick Paluza with the Eagles. Lastly, they have defensive linemen such as Jeramiah Trotter and others who could kill any quarterback they see. Eagles out.
1546	I think sadism is the most disgusting thing a person can do, because he has to hurt someone else to get some personal or sexual pleasure. To do that, you have to be subjugated, which makes you weaker than the one who is actively hurting you, which makes the pain even worse. That's "evil". But if both people are willing to participate in the pain, then it's probably masochism, albeit at the hands of another. This might sound like an odd statement, but if you pursue pain and violence, and then receive it at the hands of another, isn't that "assisted" masochism? (like assisted suicide). Even if these people are weird, I don't think that matters to me what they do in private.
1547	Since I'm not a believer in the Big Bang theory, and I believe God created all of it according to Genesis, I must say God created photosynthesis. But for those of you who disagree, I wonder how likely you think that photosynthesis evolved, something that complicated, by accident? Things like this make me wonder why we can't all believe in a supreme creator, be it God, Allah, Vishnu, or any of the gods people believe in. It just seems like someone or something had to design everything, at least in the beginning.
1548	Yes, the fix is in, just like boxing and wrestling. The NFL, due to the billions of dollars it brings in, is the same, as is baseball. Let's not forget that all sports are business, first and foremost, and entertainment second. Look at WNBA, now they let sponsors replace team logos on jerseys, Stern will do the same for NBA real soon, the sister league is just an experiment. NASCAR and the Olympics let sponsors replace jerseys. College sports are their biggest revenue, and unlike the so-called professional sports, athletes get shafted with very low wages and no contracts, which is why they jump into the pros right out of high school.
1549	I'm not sure the open platform is the best idea. Games developers will certainly have an easier time creating games, but I don't understand why you buy one box and then have an "Xbox", "PlayStation", and "Nintendo" station on it. The names are only there because they make their own consoles. The three major competitors in this industry would all be locked into one box, making money off their interfaces? Compared to third-party developers, the three companies make very few games, so it seems like the giants would lose a lot of profits. I want to see competition, competition is what drives hardware innovation and takes everything to the next generation.
1550	If education were to cost money, the poor would not be able to pay for it, and we would end up with a society where only the middle class and the wealthy would be able to thrive. As a society, we should be trying to help those who are less fortunate.
1551	Elvis's music is known all over the world, even though he's dead. You can find his CD's in almost every music store, and even in teenagers and children, who still love him.
1552	The engineering process category of SPICE provides more helpful procedures for designing or evaluating processes in typical software development projects. It explains better than CMMI the relationship between test cases and requirements and integration tests and architecture and design. Moreover, SPICE provides a detailed list of typical inputs and outputs with many characteristics that help a lot in the process development work. CMMI does not provide such a systematic approach to work products.
1553	This is a very interesting subject. I think it's possible that this could happen, considering the reactions of the world to events in one country and the ripple effect they have. When Tiananmen Square happened, there was a reaction all over the world. There weren't mass riots, but every major country had very strong opinions and many reports. The world is too open now to try and hide such incidents. I can see how that could happen.
1554	The truck is definitely better, not only because you can haul and pull things, but also because you have the strength and ability to pull yourself out of the gutter you might unintentionally drive into while using a cellphone. There are many trucks, like the Dodge Ram SRT10, that are quick enough to keep up with a lot of cars.
1555	I'd like my president to give us an idea of where these 200 prisoners will go, and if he had, pending where they would go, I'd be more inclined to agree. But, with the waterboarding incidents, which many people call torture, and the whole "It's Cuban property, not ours!" thing, I think the base should remain open. But then again, I'm only 19, and I've never been to Guantanamo Bay, so I don't know the exact happenings of the place. I haven't served in the military or personally dealt with terrorists, so my opinion isn't based on anything.
1556	I think it is reasonable to fear Islam, since it is the only major religion that explicitly commands violence against non-believers in its scriptures. For example: "But when the forbidden months are over, then fight and kill the Pagans wherever you find them, and take them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)..." Surah 9:5 or: "O ye who fear! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him" (Surah 9:123). Also, while many wars are fought for religion, Islam is the only one that explicitly commands violence in its Quran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.
1557	To start with, I'm a newbie on this site, so please don't judge me too harshly. Saga was ahead of its time, which is why it didn't sell as well as Nintendo or Playstation. Saga Dreamcast was the best system ever, and it had CDs before any other system. The Game Gear system was also great, and ahead of its time. I would love to see Saga back, and bring Sonic back home.
1558	I've had three debates in a row where I've been criticized for not taking seriously Convinceme's seriousness. Convinceme is the sole administrator of this site. What he says is final. But he hasn't. He has left us to make our own decisions. I have every right to flag any debate that I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community. If he strongly opposed what I was doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a pm. I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this site which I have grown to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve. I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I'm being greedy.
1559	The credit goes to the U.S. military and the American people. Yes, Obama signed off on it, which I suppose you can screw up in that respect, as Clinton had Osama in his hair but chose not to fire, but he wasn't involved in any way.
1560	I'm not a big fan of celebrity chefs, but this place was recommended by other reviewers and I chose it because of Bobby Flay's reputation. I wasn't disappointed. Duck starter was amazing, very spicy, queso fundido was great, tuna entree was great, service was great, although it's a bit pricey.
1561	We're staying at Paris Hotel first morning we had breakfast here the food was great and the guy who served us was nice and helpful so the next morning we didn't hesitate to have breakfast here again. Unfortunately, the waiter who was assigned to us wasn't very nice and helpful at all! They had dishes that weren't on the menu and he mumbled about dishes that were unfathomable, gave us lukewarm coffee and after he served the food, no follow up. If we needed anything, I had to ask the guy who was clearing the other tables for a coffee refill. The food was great but the second waiter we had was a complete letdown.
1562	I've been here a few times and it's very popular, but I can't figure out why. Service is slow, food quality isn't great, and the things I've had haven't had much flavor. And it's very noisy when it's full.
1563	I went here because my coworkers were raving about it, but I wasn't too impressed. The place won awards for its Thanksgiving turkey sandwich, which I had, but it wasn't anything special. The food was decent, the service was decent, and I think it's a bit overpriced. If you're tired of Subway, Quizno's, etc., going to a mom and pop shop like this one may break the monotony, but this one is also a chain.
1564	This place is a joke! We had an order for food that was lost, and after 2 hours, we finally got our food. The staff was very kind and comped our meals, but then they said that the gift cards I was using didn't allow them to use the last 10.00 on each of them, and they needed another $30.00. We didn't know that, but be careful if you use gift cards. I will let all my friends know about this!
1565	The food was great, but the service was terrible. We had a group of three and the waiter took forever to take our order.
1566	I'm a fan of fried fish, so I tried it. It's a cheap meal, but it's not very good. It's like frozen fish square on a bun. I got the deluxe, which had mayo, lettuce, and tomato, but no tartar, which is a bit of a stupid thing to do, because it would've made the sandwich more interesting, especially since they didn't put enough mayo on it. I won't be coming back.
1567	The idea of school uniforms is a bad one, the children can't show their colors.
1568	It's really bad, though I know I'll miss the days when I had to wear my uniform!
1569	I've always said it's a great idea to have a uniform at school, because it looks very nice and respectable, it shows the status of the school and its students.
1570	Great arguments why IE should be a better browser, but it's not!
1571	Unbelievable cool skins that allow me to personalize my browser, and the built-in spell checker, and all the rest of IE's stuff, that's just great.
1572	IE is terrible and makes developing more difficult, I simply do not like creating separate stylesheets for IE.
1573	No, I'd not turn them in, because it'd be too strange to turn them in to the police. I probably wouldn't tell anybody, just hoped they'd be caught by the police, and I'd tell them to turn themselves in.
1574	First, all TV series are written in script form, a kind of book...
1575	Books are better than TV, because they give us all the details in a succinct way, we can read books like stories, fairy tales, ghost stories, etc. that help us to develop our imagination. On TV, some things are explained more in depth, but in books, even if we forget something, we can still read it later.
1576	It's not just the external damage that a bad father does, it's also the deepest wounds that a child can suffer from.
1577	I'd rather be without a father than a bad father, because I wouldn't wanna know how bad he is and how bad he is as a father. Being alone with my mom is fine with me. I wouldn't want an alcoholic father who drinks all day and curses my mom. It's simple, I either have a great father or I don't have a father at all, even though he's still at home.
1578	It's better to be without a father than a bad father who's an alcoholic and beats your mom. You don't need a father who makes you feel bad about yourself.
1579	Raffles had left behind some plans and policies that were crucial to the development of Singaporean settlements before he left Singapore.
1580	The founder's definition we discussed in class that day, that founder wasn't the one who found this place, but he was crucial to its development, and raffles came to singapore and established it worldwide, although it might have been farquhar who suggested that to raffles
1581	Porn is bad, it's bad because it's not good, and if it was good, then it would be really bad.
1582	It's wrong in the Bible, sure, but it can be an addiction, just like drugs and alcohol. There's a reason God tells us what to do and what not to do.
1583	I'm telling you, porn is wrong. I mean, wtf, film nude girls, and then make them available to the public so that jerks can take advantage of them. Porn is only here because it's profitable, and dumb people like it. If it wasn't, then watch it with your family, friends, or younger people. You'll feel uncomfortable, and you'll know why: because common sense and your conscience, which is deep inside you, tells you it's wrong.
1584	What's going on with porn, sex, what's sex for?, making a baby, why should you watch other people make a baby?, pleasure, what's the cause of pleasure?, temptation, how do you fight temptation?, then do it. Conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there's a temptation to increase the number of next generations, wow.
1585	You're not going to be able to argue against the theory of creatoinism without falling into an extremely stupid argument because anyone who believes in creatoinism and is having a discussion with someone who doesn't, can say that God is making them think what they think.
1586	IE7 in Vista supports Protected Mode, which allows the browser to run in a secure context with minimal access to your PC and private information. Firefox and Internet Explorer are web applications with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
1587	Yes, because some kids, especially the wealthy kids of wealthy parents, don't understand anything except physical education.
1588	Raffles's been coming and going from Singapore, returning after a lengthy absence, while Farquar had been here all along and resolved many problems. Raffles had not done anything at all in comparison with Farquar.
1589	Whether or not Raffles was chief of this operation, Farquhar was the one who turned Singapore into today's form.
1590	William had taken the initiative to get to know the local people and to talk to them, even learning Malay for the purpose of doing so.
1591	It's not illegal to kill yourself everywhere, like in Oregon, so it's up to the woman and her religion to decide, not the government. The government has enough power to make sure that no one is forcing their religion on anyone else.
1592	I'm not trying to prove anything, just ask you to prove that we're not evolving. I never said we were still evolving, I never asserted that. Until you can provide credible evidence that we aren't evolving, you're just avoiding something you can't answer. So I say again, support your claim that we aren't evolving. And the big bang is a distraction, we're talking about evolution, not Cosmology. It seems you're trying to deflect the discussion away from the subject at hand, because you can't back up your claims.
1593	The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and didn't show evolution, but that doesn't mean other experiments and observations don't show evolution either. There's plenty of evidence for evolution. Genes, fossil record, carbon dating, geological data, virus studies. Do you know how virus strains get immune to antibiotics? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve in a shorter time, which we can see. Your flu injections are made with evolution science.
1594	For more information on radiometric dating, please visit www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html.
1595	Porn kills no one, it's a profitable source of amusement for some people, can anyone honestly tell me what's wrong with it without bringing their moral standards into the discussion?
1596	I'm not degraded by porn, you're not fond of it? Don't watch it. There's more important jobs in life than being my own moral police.
1597	It is always possible to improve yourself, but it is once in a life time to have the opportunity to improve the lives of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by improving the common good you are spreading the wealth of noblemanliness to others, which is the greatest benefit of all.
1598	I think it's a great idea, students won't have to worry about what they're wearing, they'll be more concentrated on studying, which is more efficient. If someone says they can't express themselves, well, there are many ways to do that. And I think the uniform indirectly gives students a lesson in how to dress properly. If we let them dress themselves, they could choose inappropriate clothes like hot pants, rebel jeans, or sexy clothes, which isn't good for their minds.
1599	It's better to have a bad father than no father, because dads aren't just providers, they're protectors.
1600	I'm saying lousy, if "lousy" means "unemployed, distant, disconnected, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad." But if your dad is a drug dealer, a murderer, a rapist, etc., then you can be happy that you're alive and don't know your sperma donor.
1601	There is a direct link between bottled water and certain illnesses, including cancer.
1602	TV's much better because of the bigger variety of things to watch, and some people say TV's an incontinent, but now you can watch TV on your phone, which is great.
1603	A picture is worth a thousand words, TV allows you to see, hear stories, or information. Imagine reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama, and Missouri, versus seeing them and hearing survivors' interviews on TV. Much more powerful and immediate than books.
1604	Actors and actresses wouldn't have jobs, and without TV, you wouldn't know what was happening in the world.
1605	It is claimed that this is due to European culture, since the continent's waters are highly polluted due to agriculture and industry, and the bottles they use are helping us.
1606	Craig's a hypocrite when it comes to bottled water, and he shouldn't be taken seriously.
1607	Water bottles aren't bad for the world, because when you finish drinking your water bottle, you can reuse it a few times to make several water bottles with less plastic. Plastic is also recyclable, and can be used to make new things, like new water bottles. Technically, you can reuse the same plastic water bottle over and over again. It won't hurt the economy if we learn how to do it right.
1608	The Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association have collaborated to develop guidelines for school beverages, which aim to reduce calories in beverages shipped to schools and, in turn, encourage healthier choices for children. Articles illustrate this program and its significant results to date, including a 58% reduction in total calories of all beverages shipped to schools. Additionally, a survey was conducted among parents, pediatricians, and family physicians, with the highest supported choice for each group being bottled water. (http://www.nikawater.org/bottled-water/ )
1609	The real question is, why does the government even get into this? We're taking a private, religious institution, regulating it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. It shouldn't be a political issue, because my private, religious matters should be distinct from government regulations. Marriage and government should not mix. That's the solution.
1610	Gay marriage is bad. God created man and woman for the earth, so how can the human race survive if it's only attracted to each other? Obviously not.
1611	Homosexuality is overrated, it's just another "look at me" ploy. I think it's a result of overprotective parents, or abuse, or liberal wakoness, which is actually a disease. If you don't attract attention to yourselves, nobody would really care about what you do.
1612	I am a passionate Christian, and I think homosexual marriage is bad as all hell. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should stick to them.
1613	David, then why do people from your country knock on the door of India to find peace and get rid of depression,why do most of the world's major firms employ the most Indians,because we are brilliant and truly intellectually superior.In the past we ruled the world,and we will surely rule the world again in the near future,just wait and see.
1614	India has the potential to lead the world. It has natural resources, is full of highly spiritual people, and is a country of various languages and races. It can flourish. But I cannot ignore the fact that Indian government is corrupt and poverty still exists. But, hey, China is communist and poverty is also seen in China. So why not India?
1615	You're saying that only India has these things, other countries don't, isn't America, which seems to be on top of the world, bad? It eats less, wastes more, the amount of food they waste could be used to feed the entire Indian population, it causes more pollution, blames us. What do you think?
1616	The theory of intelligent design is merely Christianity dressed up as science, but there's no real science behind intelligent design.
1617	It's time we stopped this, because religion has caused many wars in the past, it promotes racism, sexism, homophobia, it creates prejudices, it makes us hate each other.
1618	I'd say it's only if you're desperate, because I'm one of 3 siblings and we got spanked by our sister and it turned out we were disciplined, but our youngest sister hasn't been spanked in her life and she's made more mistakes than we have made even though she's 10.
1619	Yeah, so they'll have a reason for the kids not to do it again.
1620	Yes, because then they'll stop doing what they were doing, because they'll know what the consequences are, although there are some lines that parents shouldn't cross, like the line between spanking and abuse.
1621	It's okay for parents to hit their kids, as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like belts.
1622	Atheists are counting on evidence when they don't have any, and Christians have the Bible as their basis, so what do atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution's a nonsense.
1623	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment such as spanking to discipline their children. The child will listen if they have a strong healthy relationship with their parents, if they have gained their respect. Parents should have a good relationship with their children, and the child will soon respect them and agree with what their parents decide, although they may not like it. They will learn that their parents know what's best for them.
1624	Some kids don't learn by being spanked, so why waste your time on that when you can always get something valuable out of them?
1625	I'd say yes, I would, because no matter what, shouldn't force you to kill someone. How can you kill someone and say it was an error? That's not right, and I don't care what anyone says about whether it was an error or not.
1626	I'd report him, because killing someone is wrong, for any reason, and if he kills one, how can he not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones, and knowing that the person who did it paid for what he did, is reassuring.
1627	If my husband killed a stranger, I'd definitely report him, because he's a psycho, and if he kills me, too. But if he killed someone I knew, who was hurting us, then I'd think about it, and if he thinks I'm going to say something, and if he thinks I'm going to kill him, too.
1628	I'd bring my husband in, because it's just plain wrong, and I'd explain, "How would you feel if someone killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So, for doing wrong and getting better, you have to face your consequences.
1629	It's wrong to kill somebody, no matter what. If you kill somebody, then I think you should do the right thing and go to jail, rather than wait and see if somebody else will bring you in. It's hard for me to turn in my wife, but she committed a terrible crime and she should pay for it.
1630	If a person is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the option of aborting or not. If people are irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. If they don't want to have the child, they should give it up for adoption. Otherwise, people will abuse their power of choice and kill children because they're too lazy or uninformed to use protection.
1631	One word: adoption. There's absolutely no point in aborting a child when you can carry on with your pregnancy and then give the baby up for adoption. This is an often ignored fact in the abortion debate, but it's the most sensible thing to do.
1632	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant due to the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The mother can have the child and give it up for adoption or raise it as her own because she is still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people waiting to add another baby to their family. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously haven't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
1633	This is a very uncommon occurrence, which usually can be treated with contraception when a female seeks medical advice following an assault.
1634	The basic classes are more important, the children should be more concentrated on studying, and the competition can lead to bullying.
1635	Physical education isn't much of a class, students should have taken responsibility for their actions by the time they got to college. If they're responsible for their cars, they should be responsible for their health. Taxpayers don't realize that they're paying for students to go swimming or playing for an entire hour.
1636	Then the rate of obesity will be even higher than it is today, which is one of the reasons why physical education is also good for heart health, better fitness, weight loss, self discipline, and stress reduction.
1637	Why should it matter? If two people, no matter their sex, love each other to the point where they get married, shouldn't that be what the Bible really teaches us? All you Bible nutjobs are making me sick, by the way. The Bible teaches love and forgiveness, and let's not forget: judge others before you judge yourself.
1638	It doesn't mean they don't have a right to happiness just because they're gay! How would you feel if they wouldn't let you marry? We live in the twenty-first century, and everyone else can get married, so why shouldn't they?
1639	It might be against the Bible, etc., but it's just because a gay couple doesn't have kids, so it's illegal, and it's also seen as a way of weakening male status. Time has changed, and it's time to accept.
1640	I think personal goals are better, because it's your decision what you want to do with your life, and you won't always have someone beside you saying what's good and bad. It's all about you reaching your goals, and it's also a good thing to help other people achieve their goals.
1641	It seems to me that it's a good idea to do both, but first you have to help yourself, then you can help others.
1642	While America is a free speech country, if our words provoke riots or it's reasonable to assume that what you're saying could provoke others to do harm or break the law, then there may be legal repercussions. The problem is, however, that it must be shown that the other person's actions were directly and exclusively a result of the words or actions of another, which isn't always easy to prove.
1643	If that's true, and we're talking about a fairly short time span, then you're probably fine. But how you say it depends. The facts are one thing, but if you use a hurtful way of telling the truth, that could be seen as an unjustified verbal assault, and depending on the circumstances, that could be a violation of your rights.
1644	The girls grew up with abuse, and now they seem to be aware that they're going to be murdered at any moment, and they still do it. The money they make is paying for the drugs they use to forget about what they're doing to themselves, and some of them manage to get away with it.
1645	Strangely enough, in New Zealand, the crown has been ordered to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the indigenous people, despite the treaty not being recognised by international law. There have been many other treaties established during the colonising period, which if New Zealand is precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally, I am of the opinion that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that have been a cornerstone of international law. If Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of King's peace. I think there would be an indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today.
1646	I'm guessing by your name, you're a Marine. Crimes are crimes, and some of them can be forgiven with hard work and real change. I'm an NCO, and I've seen soldiers grow up and take their duty and the rules seriously. You can change, even if you get kicked out. You always have the option of choosing the right path, just hoped you don't do it too late, like Tookie Williams did.
1647	Since it's been 8 months, I doubt you'll be able to get anything done. Not only do you have to prove they knew about the damage, but courts don't side with mere assumptions. If you want to buy a used car, take it to a mechanic and have him check it out. If he doesn't agree, then you should ask for legal assistance.
1648	It is sad, and the system we have created, The courts are the best human beings have created so far in this world, but they aren't perfect, and there are always errors. As you correctly point out, the public officials aren't much help. But the important thing is not to give up, ever. Even in jail, a person can use his or her wits, study the law, actively work on the appeal. Time limits are essential. Bad things happen to good people, and life isn't fair. Sometimes all you can do is look to the future and try to make the best of each day.
1649	This is a sovereign country of laws, and no one should be able to break them for any reason if they want to survive.
1650	In a country subject to the common law, a court's decision is binding on other courts, so it's not illegal for a court to do what it's supposed to do. Civil law systems, like France or Luxembourg, work differently, and their rulings aren't as binding as in the common law.
1651	We're all human, and usually we do something wrong once in a while, and it's just a bit of an annoyance, plus all those bounced check fees. But if you're worried about getting arrested, then I'm sure you're doing this purposefully, and trying to cheat the company. You've probably already sent them some bad checks to try and trick them, so your guilt is probably pretty well established. And hopefully you won't end up sharing a jail cell with some kind of gross deviation.
1652	It's legal, since salaried workers don't get overtime. But there's one condition: minimum wage laws still apply to salaried workers, so figure out how many hours you work annually and divide your salary by that number. If the result is lower than the federal minimum wage (5.15), or your state minimum wage (7.63, maximum in Washington), or even your local minimum wage (9.50 in Santa Fe), your employer is breaking the law.
1653	The webmaster is right, this isn't just unethical, it's Stalin's workings during the Cold War. But it's not all that unusual. He's making bad, and very horrible decisions at the oval office, starting with rigging the election. This is a catastrophe, and I'm not surprised that his idea of public safety is ruining, ending, and controlling the lives of his citizens, allowing the real bad guys to do all kinds of damage, and getting there just in time to kill some more of his people and innocent civilians elsewhere.
1654	Police brutality exists in the U.S. for the simple fact that they don't screen individuals properly before granting them badges and firearms. They give these gung-ho I'm capable of doing anything guys who think they can get away with it because they're cops a job. Also, factor in the race card, because most cases are white on black crimes, they fear the black man, so they automatically resort to violence to solve the issue. It sickens me that they allow them to get away with this. This country prides itself on freedom, what about freedom to go out and drive and not have to worry about the people who are supposed to protect you. Stop Racism, stop police brutality. And this is written by a Caucasian man, so don't think that I'm complaining about being black.
1655	It's President Clinton, and even if people say it's politics, it's the same thing. If it's bad now, it was bad then. There's always been a double standard between democrats and republicans, people are screaming about illegal war, but I don't remember President Clinton ever asking Congress for any wars that he's leading us into, but there's President Bush, who has.
1656	Yes, and most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge puts people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on a park bench drunk. The whole city knows, the lawyers, the cops, etc. We watched the cops pull him over one night, take him home, and we followed them. How do you fight that?
1657	The death penalty is not revenge, but a punishment which is given to a person when he is found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers. There are laws which determine which crimes and in which circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty if convicted.
1658	No, not unless you're a real estate broker and you've got a written agreement signed by all the beneficiaries of the estate to that effect, or the court allows it on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on things like extra time and liability, rather than a percentage of the sale price, which would be a commission.
1659	That cell bunch may have saved millions of lives, stem cell research. What about my right to live? Best medicine should be available to all, but maybe procedures/treatments arising from stem cell research should be optional. For example: "Miss Smith, you have cancer, we can treat it. Would you like the treatment, or would you rather die painfully?" And would you like fries with that?
1660	You should get a new boyfriend, he doesn't seem to be capable of changing or willing to change. Driving with a suspended driver's license is a serious misdemeanor. He's been sent to rehab for a second chance, but he's screwed up that too, and now they're finding out about the driving violation and kicking him out of rehab, so he could end up in jail. You should break up with him, you'll be glad you did.
1661	The person above is completely wrong. Real estate is real estate. He'll own it as long as he can pay taxes and mortgage. The business will remain its business as long as he can run it. He can sell his house or his business only on his own terms, the government cannot take it away just because he's here illegally. But he could run into trouble with the IRS if he doesn't pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status at all. The IRS has no authority over any citizen or non-citizen who doesn't pay all their business taxes. So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills.
1662	Not all downloads are copyright infringement. For example, if someone owns the work, they have the right to let others make copies and distribute it.
1663	I had a similar situation with my husband, he had an expired ID from another country, the consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID, so we asked them what they should do, they suggested official school records, you request them, keep them sealed, and let the DMV open them, just to make sure you're the person.
1664	You're either very young or new to this land. If you've got money or are famous, you can get any verdict or law you like. But if you're poor, you're just unlucky. Attorneys won't take your case unless it's a fortune for them. Even if you're completely right, they won't take it unless it's a fortune for them. So, please, listen up. Money is privilege under the law, poverty is nothing. Save yourself a lot of time and learn it now.
1665	In any case, conservatives are in favor of maintaining the traditional way of life, stability, and so are against any social upheaval or change. They believe that too much change is hazardous, destabilizing, and ultimately will kill a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means some degree of restriction of freedom. Moderates, on the other hand, agree that change is necessary, that freedom is important, and that both can be beneficial, but that full anarchy is not desirable, and that the state can actually help preserve freedom.
1666	I'm sorry, wrong, gorgeousleepingwalli. Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing Prison. (You must actually read the stuff you Google before you jump to conclusions and post an answer here.) Although she is listed as the first female executed by electrocution, on 3/20/1899. While Louisiana has executed several women, the first executed by electric chair was Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/42...64 years ago today...good question considering the date today...
1667	I think the judge has every right to ask the woman in question to remove the veil, because she is not doing her job properly because of the veil, and neither is the judge.
1668	I don't believe that terrorists should have equal rights, but I do believe that they should be treated like people. If they can't be calm, then they shouldn't be able to go out on the street. If they cannot be reformed, and they are still disobedient, no government should allow them to do that! Terrorism costs lives, and tax dollars, and I wouldn't mind if they were executed for their crimes! It might sound cruel, but think of all the lives that could be saved!
1669	I'm not sure, but ask if there's a youth court or juvenile court system you can go through. These are systems where teenagers learn about the legal system by being jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes judges. Usually, if you go to juvenile court, you end up doing community service and the offence doesn't stay on your record. My preachy moment: drink if you want to drink, but never ever ever drink and drive. It's stupid and inexcusable.
1670	It's not reaction times, it's the crime itself you're being punished for. Driving while intoxicated is a special case, because there are special laws regulating alcohol and drugs. But while you can easily test for alcohol and drugs using objective blood tests, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairment. So, driving while intoxicated can be punished separately, because there are objective standards, while anything else can only be punished according to those results.
1671	The laws need to be changed. No way should a parent be allowed to just walk away from the marriage and leave the kids behind. If they want to leave without being judged as a danger, an adulterer, or insane, then they should leave with nothing.
1672	It's not that simple, there are many rules about what you can and cannot do with the flag, assuming that we're talking about the world's greatest and most beautiful flag, Old Glory. See the link below for more information.
1673	I'm sorry you're in this situation, but you need to be sure you're really in love, and you only said you believed you were. Don't mix up feelings of affection with other things. Did you know he was your uncle before you got involved? There's a short time to apply the brakes on who you love. What about the other woman he's with? Have you talked to her yet? If I were you, I'd try to stay away from him. If he manages to end his relationship with that other woman and maintain his relationship with his kids, then maybe you can give it another shot. I don't know about the laws and deformities, but just think of the people involved in this web and how your decisions will affect them. It's difficult, I know. Good luck.
1674	From your words, I think you're aware of it, and probably trying to grow it. Marijuana seeds don't fly from birds, and any idiot can see from a leaf what weed looks like. You can get in trouble for growing, but not too much if you grow only one plant and say you don't know what it looks like. They won't believe you anyway. If the cops find out, then your friends aren't really your friends.
1675	Using illegal drugs is a crime, no matter what your condition or sex is. However, a woman who would expose her child to illegal drugs or alcohol should face a more severe punishment. Sure, I would have thought of institutionalizing the mother until the child is born and then sending her to jail. The problem is, who will pay for this? That's right, the taxpayer. Accountability is the most important quality that is missing in many Americans today. The fact that we tolerate stupidity and irresponsibility is enabling these people to continue making bad decisions, having children, using drugs...etc. Until we hold people accountable and responsible for their actions, there is no real solution. Good luck and take care.
1676	Unfortunately, that's unlikely. The court is unlikely to change the precedent, but hopefully, it will uphold the ban on latency, require parents to inform teenagers about their children, and force these "doctors" to become mandatory reporters of abuse, just like all physicians.
1677	People say it's against God, so people who feel that way should refuse wedding invitations from gays. People make these rules and use God as an excuse. There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you hear anyone complaining? Anyway, marriage doesn't have to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day by a peace officer, by a mayor, even by a ship captain. Atheists get married. What's the big deal? People who say it's sinful leave the "sinners" alone, after all, isn't it their God's job to judge and punish? And they believe that their God gave them "free will", right?
1678	I think ADHD and possibly some forms of autistic aren't bad, they're just the next level of human evolution. ADHD makes you hard to focus, but when you do, you hyper focus, grasping everything. I've got so many friends with ADHD, and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get great grades, and retain more knowledge. Some people with autistic disorder can be servants, which means they're very good at something, usually math, science, or music, which is great. I think we should let these kids blossom and be their own unique awesome person, moving humanity to the next level in our history. Please, cmv!
1679	Political ideology is like a secular religion in this respect. Many self-proclaimed liberals, libertarians, and conservatives rarely listen to each other about how to better society. Liberals see government as the sole solution to all of society's problems. Conservatives and libertarians see government as merely a deterrent to social problems, and adhere to free market fundamentalism as holy. It's as if the free market makes everything a utopia. These differences in dogma often resort to divisive politics. How is that different from religious differences?
1680	I am in my twenties, and healthy. I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow, which costs between $400,000 and $800,000 to transplant my marrow, which I give away free. And while I'm on that list, I'd be willing to sell my liver, which I know I could sell for at least $100,000 to a wealthy alcoholic who couldn't get on that list, and if I can't do that, then shouldn't be able to use that as an argument for abortion. The medical industry is making money hand over fist, and I want a piece of it.
1681	The proof is in the pudding: take something you consider yourself truly knowledgeable about, and look at the coverage in the media: it's only partially correct, at best. You'll meet people who "read an article" in your field, and realize how gullible they sound. Journalists can only give so much context, and usually they don't give enough to the layperson to make a start on the subject. This doesn't mean that news isn't valuable, but if you read the paper every day, and gravitate towards Ukrainian stories, without any historical context, and haven't visited Ukraine or Russia, and haven't done any research, and haven't met people from the cultures in question, you should speak, think, and feel with an extremely humble tone, rather than express any opinion at all.
1682	Of course, stop when there's a train, but my feeling is that stopping, listening to the train, and then going again is much more dangerous than not stopping at the train crossing. I have three reasons: 1. If your engine quits or you have some other problem as you are crossing the tracks, you no longer have the momentum to get to safety. 2. The act of stopping could cause another vehicle to crash into you because they are not expecting it. 3. If for some reason you stop but don't actually hear/see a train coming for some reason (unlikely, but still a possibility), you are now on the tracks for a much longer period of time, increasing your risk. I think that the safest option is just approach level crossings like every other vehicle on the road. CMV
1683	This isn't complicated, I'm just throwing out ideas here. I'm not an American, so I don't fully understand your system. I hope this doesn't sound stupid.
1684	I'm a 19 year old male student at college. I plan on majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math. I have never had an intimate relationship, nor have I ever asked a girl out. Part of this is because I know they'll say no. I'm not an attractive person, I'm very fat and have very poor hygiene. And even if they did say yes, the relationship would only last for a day at most. I consider myself to be a weird guy. I listen to weird songs on my iPod, I watch weird videos, and I have no hobbies other than playing video games, surfing the internet, and watching movies/TV. I feel that a person like me isn't really meant to have a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any kind. I feel that I need to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.
1685	I think that the people who are most likely to glorify this film are the ones who watched it as children or young adults, viewing it through nostalgia colored glasses, people whose first exposure to real and dramatic story was that film, so they came to believe that it was doing something unique or special (when it really, really wasn't).
1686	I understand the main objection is that this will lead to people believing that the system is rigged, and that nobody wins the big jackpots. However, it's a bit ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in winnings just disappear without any lottery employees coming forward. Furthermore, why do we not question the legitimacy of other large jackpots? People have been buying scratch-off tickets for a long time without these ridiculous self-identification laws.
1687	I'm working downtown LA, and the homeless problem is really bad. This morning, there was a guy throwing his shit outside our building. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways, because our subways don't have gates, and they use the honor system. They're a nuisance to everybody, and most of them look like they're suffering from some sort of illness. I think any major city should solve this problem faster, and I think the homeless should be picked up, put in camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way, the downtown area would be cleaner and safer, and the homeless would get the help they need. The usual approach of most cities, which is to ignore the problem, isn't working, and it's really hurting the local economy.
1688	I've been booking flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong, via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur, for about 2 hours prior to the MH17 disaster. Yesterday, I received an e-mail from Malaysia Airlines offering a full refund or the right to cancel the bookings on 24 July. I'm now questioning the safety record of this airline, even though it seems that there was no way to prevent the latest tragedy. The fate of MH370 is still unsolved, and the Malaysian stock market, which has grown by 80% over the last five years, while Malaysia Airlines' shares have fallen by the same amount, is a reflection of the decline in consumer confidence. Given all this, I'm seriously considering taking up their offer of a refund.
1689	I'm hoping Bungie isn't going to make a revolutionary game, but this looks like Borderlands with a different setting and tone. But, in other words, it's a good looking FPS with classes, co-op, and loot in a variety of small open world areas. How is that so revolutionary? The setting looks good, and I like the idea of an epic quest across the solar system in my trusty spaceship, but the fact that ships can't be flown and there's no space combat was a big disappointment to me. Please, I want to be more excited for this game than I am, but I just can't see it.
1690	I'm a native of Canada, but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I found that everyone here wants to preserve their culture and wave a flag that represents their blood and heritage. I thought this was great, and for a while I clung to it myself, but now I see that it's just a way of being stuck and not developing culturally and personally.
1691	I'm of the opinion that kids owe their parents everything, because they brought them into this world, and gave them life, and fed, and protected, and kept them relatively healthy in childhood. Kids ought to spend their whole lives at home, or as near to home as they can get, so that when their parents need anything, they can stop what they're doing and help them, because they owe them their lives.
1692	I'm not sure that guys like me have half the courage to try and talk to a girl, let alone ask her out. All the things that SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about are things that most guys wouldn't do. It's a huge stereotype. Anecdotal evidence isn't a good indicator of "oppression" that's exaggerated. In many cases, guys don't even get half a chance. For example, women claim equal rights, but they don't even pursue a man because social norms say they should. #YesAllWomen only rides on the coattails of the Santa Barbara shooting, and has nothing to do with feminism.
1693	I think Japan needs to be much more careful against China, which is becoming stronger both economically and militarily, and I'm sure they have many generals desperate to get back at all the atrocities committed during WW2. And Japan will not admit genocide, like Germany did with the Holocene, which is just sprinkling salt on the wound. On the other hand, Japan is protected by US forces, but how much can they trust in the US? Would the US go to war with China over Japan? (Or, more importantly, South Korea?) I think it wouldn't, and in a crisis, they would simply choose to abandon their allies.
1694	The goal of affirmative action is to level the playing field and give every student a chance to go to college, no matter their background. Basing that aid on skin color, while changing a possibly disadvantageful historical stereotype, does not achieve that goal. Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a person, but given at birth by parents. Why should this unearned, pre-decided trait determine the scholarship a student receives? While many schools do, some schools that have to fill "race quotas" to "diversify the campus" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.
1695	I'm aware that the Democratic Party is collecting the most money from super PACs, and I'm aware that our dues are pathetic, and that Teamsters and other unions are providing a comparatively tiny amount of cash to politicians, compared to the corporations. There's so much unchecked power of capital, and the ability to pay for pro-union politicians would be a great democratic check on that.
1696	I'm not sure how popular this is on reddit, but in real life, I hear arguments about what the Founding Fathers would have thought. I don't think it matters, because they weren't gods who could have foreseen any problem or known everything, they were just people. We live in a different time than they did, and even if we didn't, they weren't infallible. I don't mean that their views are always wrong, but I don't think their views deserve any more weight just because they are one of the Founding Fathers.
1697	I've been struggling with this for a long time, and I'd love to hear some strong arguments from the other side.
1698	I have to admit that I may not be the majority view, but I should have used the word overweight rather than fat. People do require a percentage of body fat to be healthy.
1699	The creationists say evolution is wrong, and creationism is right, but the fossil record shows ancient clams lived in layers beneath giant land sloths. If all organisms lived at the same time, how did a giant land sloth, which travels at about 1 mph, manage to outrun and survive an organism that lives primarily on water during a global flood? It seems to me that this is ludicrous, and the flood never happened, and evolution's timetable is correct.
1700	Reality TV is garbage. First of all, it's scripted, intended only for amusement, and it's not really reality. People live vicarously through reality TV shows. For example, The Bachelor teaches our teenage girls that we need to be pretty and fight with 20 different women to get their attention for a fairy-tale wedding, which isn't real. Also, many reality TV shows, such as Rock of Love, Flavor Flav, degrade women, and our kids watch them.
1701	I'm embarrassed to be ignorant about the project status, so maybe some of you gentlemen can fill me in. I'm completely convinced that a useful stripped-down laptop can be made for under a hundred dollars. When I traveled, I was always given this really great Asus Eee, which cost me around 300 dollars. I'm also completely convinced that access to information infrastructure is essential for nation building, but Microsoft Powerpoint isn't. Can anybody clarify that for me, will these laptops have internet access?
1702	Yes, friends change, but my whole life, my family has lived in the same house, they've been the most constant presence in my life, and not just because we're all alike, and have similar strengths and principles, but also because adopted kids want to see their families, because they belong to them. I'm more connected to my family than any other creature on this planet.
1703	I'm not sure the creator of this debate had a specific event in mind when he posted it, but I'm willing to take part anyway.
1704	I'd say before, I haven't been married, but I've spent a lot of time with someone who was my common law spouse, so I think it's the same thing. When it comes to sex, I think it's better when it's fresh, and you're experiencing the excitement of being with someone new, or different. When you've been with someone for a while, it's more of a routine, and you don't experiment as much, and you just kind of get used to the position, and the girl, and everything. I like the excitement of being with someone, and you're constantly excited, and you can't keep your hands off each other.
1705	The real question should be: Why don't we admit it?
1706	Death is supposed to be celebrated as an element in life, not as an empty tomb you're looking at. It's a reminder that the person isn't who he is, or even who he was to everyone around him. Funerals are just reminders that the dead won't be the same as they were to their survivors. It's selfishness, celebrate the dead, everything about them, remember and be happy. Don't mourn for your loss, celebrate their life.
1707	We're not talking about killing for fun, we're talking about putting an animal to sleep. Your argument doesn't apply here. What we're saying is, when it comes to animals, there's no point in putting a sick animal through an ordeal just so its mate doesn't feel sorry for it. But when it comes to people, there's a different story. Besides the emotional trauma which is much more complicated in a person than an animal, since we're more complicated than animals, people have a responsibility to their spouses and especially their kids, who depend on their parents not only for food, but education, and many other things. Reptiles, on the other hand, desert their offspring as soon as the eggs hatch. A snake will eat its own eggs if it can't find food.
1708	I don't know if you can, you know, since video games and movies are all we've got, is it really possible to kill something that's already dead? We don't really know. And if somethingpossessed the undead, I don't think we'd be able to kill them, since they're already dead, and can't be killed by anything we have.
1709	Art is art, that's true, and when it's in the right place, like a neighborhood, nightclub, etc. It's part of the culture and good. But no, because when it's defaced public buildings, historical sites, bridges in public areas and other otherwise beautiful landmarks of town, it's wrong. Those things are meant to look professional.
1710	The runes were discovered magically by Odin when he hung for nine days from Ygdrassil, the world tree, and in his agony and delirium he saw visions of runes on the ground below him. Initially, the runes were just symbols with magical properties, and later they developed into some kind of writing system The Iranian writing system of today (I'm not sure what its official name is), the characters look incredible and I think that this writing system is the most beautiful writing system in the world to look at
1711	Animal testing should be allowed only in strict conditions, until a viable alternative is available which is as cheap and efficient as animal testing. Such strict conditions should include: suitable habitat for animals, adequate diet, no cruel treatment, and only for specific, defined diseases or disorders. They should not use animal testing for products such as cosmetics or perfumes, but when testing a drug that may cure cancer, animal testing may be the best option, as it is cheap and one of the most efficient tests available.
1712	Not at all, because morality is a very subjective thing, and the fact that you say someone isn't moral is about as valid an argument as "you're bad."
1713	Isn't it better to give a little than not give at all? If I'm going to buy an iPod anyway, why don't I get a red one that gives a tiny bit of the purchase price to combat Aids, rather than a green one that fits better in my clothing but raises no more than Apple's pocket?
1714	Bad Company is boring, it's difficult to kill people in there, the controls are strange, vehicles are boring and difficult to control for some reason, maps are too big. On cod, the map called "Wastland" is one of the biggest and people hate it.MW2 is very intense because you always wonder what's going to come from around the corner, or if there's a sniper in the window, or hiding under the roof, ready to shoot you, or if there's a grenade waiting for you, or if there's a bullet in your head. But all this goes through your mind as you play, you get hit from behind and you die.Battlefield is boring because you always know where the enemy is and you don't have to go get them, you can just drive around being bored, and the maps are too big to go out of your way to kill someone, unlike in MW2, you're put into the meatgrinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to develop.Also, weapons in MW2 are realistic, except the At4, which isn't a guided missile.
1715	I think school uniforms are just another way the government gets your money.
1716	The hotel claims that people use the parking garage for airport crap, so they share the cost of the valet, so you don't have to tip at all. It's disgusting, given all the bad press this place gets. The Venetian doesn't charge for valet, and Mandalay Bay is so greedy. It's the MGM corporation in general, all their hotels do this. I found out that if you park at Mandalay's shopping center valet, it's free. It's a bit silly to complain about this, but the casinos rip off everyone and then fill up the mall parking.
1717	The food was ok, nothing special. The portions are huge, but I don't make my food decisions solely on calories.
1718	This place was a last minute find and it was not what I was expecting in the slightest. Who would have thought that the sushi would be so good, so delicious, and so fresh? Our group of 10 had a great experience with the service and the location in Vegas. We'll definitely be back for dinner and a show.
1719	There's this really neat little place called Vietnam Grille on South Blvd. It's small, which is a good sign, and it's right off the highway. Yesterday was windy, damp, and cold, which was perfect for Pho. We went in for lunch, which was busy, but we were seated right away and our order was taken perfectly. We ordered some Crispy Spring Rolls and #26 which is Beef Pho. Spring Rolls were delicious, all the sauces on the side of the table went on to my plate to make a delicious dipping sauce. The Soup arrived -- huge Bowl! Full of delicious broth, noodles, beef and all the extras on the side to add, bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapenos! It was piping hot and delicious. You have to try it. I will be back again and again!
1720	The waiter was great, very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal. The food was just okay.
1721	This place is great for American subs. The ingredients are always fresh and the bread is always soft. The staff is very nice and they make the sandwiches very quickly, which I appreciate. However, I've given them 4 stars because on multiple occasions they asked me if I wanted cheese on my sub, I said yes, they charged me for the sub, and when I got the sub, there wasn't any cheese on it.
1722	I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy my experience at Caffe Boa. I was in the area with 4 friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30. Our friend had made a reservation for 4 people, but when we arrived with an extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat and sat and sat. We were never greeted. Not even a water. We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes. Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater.
1723	Schools shouldn't have to dress codes. On the one hand, uniforms help students concentrate better, on the other hand, they help keep order at school (kids are highly impressionable, etc.). But kids are allowed to be creative. As with any law or code, they can have specific rules that prevent students from wearing certain things.
1724	Another advantage of wearing school clothes is that they're always clean, covering every part of the body the school doesn't want students to show, and students won't worry about what they wear.
1725	School uniforms are useless and unnecessary when the child is not in school, compared to civil clothes.
1726	There are many reasons why FF IE is stupid:
1727	TABS is one feature that's a deal breaker, see what IE copied from Version 7...
1728	I'm not sure if I'd answer "yes" or "no," depending on the circumstances. If it's really out of hand and the police know it's my guy and they've got all the evidence and witnesses that it's him who committed the crime, then I'd turn him in. If they know it's him, it's just a question of time.
1729	No, I'd not turn in my spouse, but I would've tried to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. But it would also depend on the reason for killing someone, which can't be a random killing, because I would've turned him in for that, because I think that's what would happen if I myself were murdered.
1730	It depends, really, on what happened, and if I could empathize with her, and understand why she did what she did, then I might be able to forgive her and not turn her in.
1731	Murder is an unforgivable mistake, but love isn't.
1732	I mean, you're not specifying who she killed or why. She may have had a reason. Not everybody deserves to live, you know.
1733	I'd never report him unless he killed more than one, because there's no way it was an accident more than once.
1734	I could go on and on about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, East of Eden, Nabokov's Lolita, 1984, Martian Chronicles, there's really nothing better than a world that's been written about.
1735	Books are cool, TV's not, books are for nerds, TV's for freaks, I like Black Ops better!
1736	Books don't harm your eyes, as TV. does, Reading books allows your brain to imagine, rather than imagining for you.
1737	'Cause it's better for the younger kids who have to do their homework, and it's better for their eyes, because kids who have to do homework have to read more than watch TV.
1738	I think India isn't ready to lead the world for many reasons.. 1.) our politicians are involved in black money cases. They're trying to get as much money as they can. 2.) they always try to make useless topics a big deal. For example, if one politician says something about another politician, they try to make it a big deal.
1739	China's going to be dominant, if not the U.S., India won't be able to destroy the world!
1740	This debate is ridiculous. No, they're not. They're practically a 3rd world country.
1741	India doesn't have the potential to lead the world because it's full of corruption, politicians' corruption, many religions, fighting between different religions and so on..
1742	He's got a boss, he must follow him and not do anything else, otherwise why can't Farquhar help Singapore after he was fired? I say again you need to be in a certain position to be a founder, as time, money, effort are all invested in you. You must know people who will help you.
1743	On 28 January 1819, Raffles arrived in Singapore and saw the good location of Singapore, he signed an agreement in February 1819 with the Sultan of Johor, on behalf of the British East India Company, to use the southern part of Singapore for British trade and settlement.
1744	Adrian Peterson, are you my husband, truly? If you're not, then I'm sorry. Your name and your speech convinced me that you were, which was great.
1745	The argument that pornography exposes reality, which makes people more mature, and thus prevents possible sexual assaults, is completely nonsense. Porn is definitely bad. After consuming it, you almost die from guilt that you've wasted your time, your energy, your efforts, that you haven't put in something else, that you haven't given yourself over to something else, that you haven't regretted that you've not started. Believe me, that's a path that shouldn't be taken, that's as bad as smoking and drug use. I think the only reason it's not banned in most developed countries is that they have an aging population.
1746	Porn is bad, mainly because they're not doing it right. It should be HD, and in 3 years it'll be 3D.
1747	You are just as brainwashed as I am, except you are on the other side.
1748	From a casual Internet user, I prefer IE because it's more elegant and simpler to manage bookmarks and history. But I use Firefox because my brother set it as my default browser, so I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again.
1749	Physical education is a waste of time and should not be taught at school.
1750	There were often crimes like robbery and fighting, so Farquhar founded a little police force.
1751	In the first years of Singapore, Farquar had been faced with everyday problems, he had also tried to get to know the people, and he had understood Malay, while Raffles had scarcely communicated with them.
1752	Your argument isn't valid, because in the cases you've mentioned, mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state interferes in these cases when there's a mental illness.
1753	What does legalizing drugs have to do with saving lives? Making abortion legal will help save lives by preventing women from having to illegally abort a child and kill themselves at the same time.
1754	This is the typical view of the creationist argument. Nothing Sean said has anything to do with science, this is a theological view of the world.
1755	Porn isn't bad, of course not! Everyone has a different definition of morality, so don't look at it if you don't believe in it. People who watch it, they do it for the right reasons, and probably enjoy it.
1756	Regardless of whether you're doing something for yourself or others, you're still affecting people around you. When you ask someone why they choose to help the common good, they'll usually answer "because it feels good to help." In the end, people won't help each other unless they get some kind of satisfaction from it, whether that's community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just knowing that they're important. When you help others, you make yourself feel good, and you make others feel good, too.
1757	In the long run, it's better to serve the common good than to serve ourselves first.
1758	Even if your dad isn't the best, or doesn't always care about you, he's still your dad. Every dad has a special connection to his kids, which shapes and molds sons and daughters character and personality. I think our parents play a major role in shaping who we are, even if they're not nice.
1759	For example, I grew up without a father, and if I had to choose between being a billionaire or having a father, I'd pick him. I'm basically a bastard legally, because he's not even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father, because honestly, it's bad for them. Kids at school are going to ask you about your father, and you don't know what to say. No matter how bad your father is, kids need to always be in touch with their father, even if he's not with their mom anymore.
1760	I'd rather have a bad father than be without a father, because at least I'd have peace of mind knowing who my father was, rather than spend my whole life trying to find out.
1761	The use of plastic bottles, which may be a major corporate activity, does not make the environment any worse than it already is, because they will not start to degrade for another 700 years.
1762	People are drinking water every day, but they're not aware that they're destroying their planet.
1763	The high price of bottled water is not the water itself, but rather the costs of packaging, transporting, marketing, retailing and delivering it around the world.
1764	Water bottles, good or bad? A lot of people think plastic water bottles are great, but they're bad for the environment and they're not needed at all.
1765	Sheep counted on him to sleep, he won the World Series of Poker in 1995 with one card.
1766	Plastics can kill many species of fish, and in one fish, we found 26 pieces of fish. Fish are of vital importance for the environment, because they are food for birds, which eat insects, so the cycle of life is complete.
1767	No one can understand anything, no matter how clever they are, no matter how clever they are, unless they use their brains, which they aren't, and that's why they watch TV. And to watch TV in the dark, while reading a book, you need the lights on, which is also wasting energy.
1768	I think TV's more helpful, because you can see and hear things explained, like when you read about blossoming or spore formation, you need to visualize it in your head, but when you watch an animation of blossoming, you understand it better. Some people can't even imagine, so TV's helpful. But as far as time limits and eye damage are concerned, we should only watch TV within limits, because overdoing anything is bad, even reading books. Surveys have shown that normal people remember 10% of what they read, and 50% of what they heard and saw.
1769	People against TV keep saying that TV causes obesity, I'm not going to run and bring a book along, I think TV is easier to exercise than reading. People at gyms don't have books in front of them, they have TVs, which are even more stimulating than books.
1770	I'd say it helps you relax if you're tired, but you can also read to relax. Plus, have you ever thought about the commercials and how annoying they are?
1771	Marriage has evolved from moral and religious reasons, not just a state-approved union. Degrading marriage to accommodate base desires of gay couples under a veil is a stupid thing to do.
1772	India is rapidly becoming a hub for international trade and investment, with enormous potential for growth of trade and investment in sectors such as mechanical and electrical engineering, food processing, automobile, tourism, banking and so on. Almost every multinational company is looking to India.
1773	Christians are also fun to laugh at, because they're wasting half their Sundays in church. What a waste!
1774	I don't consider most religions to be ridiculous or illogical, the only people who believe in them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really don't have any original thought processes, at least most of their followers. Then there are those who will twist any logic to suit their views, those are smart, so beware of them. I'm not an atheist by any means, but I would rather be called an atheist than a Christian, because it makes more sense to me.
1775	We've always believed in ghosts of the sky that don't have any proof at all, ever since history was written.
1776	I'd say you should hit your kids if they do something really bad, like wreck your car or steal, you have to hit them so they know it's not right.
1777	Yes, because if they're afraid of being hit, then they won't do it again.
1778	Only when the child is in need of discipline should parents resort to spanking as an option of discipline. If the child does not behave in the way he should behave after several warnings, then he deserves a spanking.
1779	I think spanking should be used if it teaches the child in the long run, but every child responds differently to different punishments, so that while one child can simply say no or ground them, another child may need a spanking to teach him what's right and wrong.
1780	If nothing else works, spanking a child is a good way to punish him, I think.
1781	I'm in favor of this, because spankings teach you not to do it again and to fear doing it again.
1782	I'd also point out that atheism predates Christianity, which destroys your "test of time" argument (which, by the way, is nonsense ad populum). In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.
1783	Parents should not resort to spanking as a method of disciplining their children, because it only irritates them and makes them mad, rather than showing them what they've done wrong.
1784	No, spanking isn't the answer to your problems, you should talk to your child with love and understanding so that they'll understand what they're doing wrong.
1785	I'd turn her in immediately, because if she did something like that, then she's a bit insane, loCo, insane in the brain, and I don't want to be her next victim. Murder is murder, and it's illegal and wrong.
1786	I'm aware some people are crazy for love, but that's not the solution or an option for me, to take another's life.
1787	Murder is a crime that cannot be overlooked, sleeping next to someone who committed a crime, and you know about it, makes you as accountable as the person who committed it.
1788	There's no excuse for killing a child, a fetus, anyone. If a woman is raped, it's not her fault. The woman with the child, whoever she is, should speak for the child and know that the child would like to live.
1789	I'm so not fond of P.E. I have to run so much and I hate it so much!
1790	P.E. doesn't help overweight kids, they just eat too much, or grow up, and in due course they'll be normal.
1791	This idea is basically playing semantics. Most people who oppose gay marriage are really against gays, so calling it "civil union" will satisfy them, but they will still not be satisfied. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth, where climate change will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, then law should never change. We should go back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?
1792	If they want to get married, let them, if they were your child or your adoptive parents, you'd accept it!
1793	I'll go for personal interest because, in my opinion, human nature is to put oneself first. Personal interest doesn't mean being selfish and only interested in one's own interests. First, I have to think about myself and my success, then I have to think about others.
1794	Our animal instinct is survival, that's why we flinch when we see something approaching, our mental state changes, in today's postmodern world, our instinct is to get money to live. Times change, but our urge to survive above all is still there.
1795	I've always been trying to be the best pole vaulter I can be, or the best at whatever I do. And I've learnt a lot about being more responsible and more faithful in my efforts to reach that personal goal.
1796	It's a 50-50 chance for me. I believe that we should all try to be less selfish and do things that are "good for society", but on the flip side, we live in the real world and do things that are better for us. For example, at work, you don't want to make another employee, you want to look nice so you can make more money.
1797	I'm talking about personal goals, because I think that in order to achieve your goals, you need to help yourself first. If you don't help yourself, then you can't help anyone. And if you help yourself first, then you'll be a better person, and I think that when you reach your goals and you're a better person, then you'll be able to help the common good.
1798	He's a ex-convict, she doesn't need to worry about anything legally. There's almost no chance (almost...) that she'll be tried for perjury, but he might be able to do something in civil court... honestly, if she's got a new car, she should just give the old one back, because it's not worth the hassle. Remember, it's the district attorney's decision whether or not to file criminal charges, and he's not going to get into a family quarrel like this... Even in the extremely unlikely event that the District Attorney decides to take a look at the case, he'll be prosecuting on one very serious ground: The case would be based on the word of a convict against the word of your niece, her mother, and her grandmother. District Attorneys don't prosecute cases they know they can't win.
1799	I believe that when we expect the police to do a certain job, they should be duly empowered in writing to take the necessary steps, including the use of force, to perform the duties of that job. I also believe that citizens should be more involved in community policing, neighborhood watch is a great program, if more people were doing it, there would be less demand for police, etc.
1800	I do not think that there are any victimless crimes, by definition. We can question the reasons for certain laws, because they seem to be without harm to the individual, group, or society as a whole. But to assess the full impact of the measure, we need to take into account all its aspects, such as street work, which is harmful to the neighborhood, and should be prohibited. The same considerations should apply to other 'victimless' crimes.
1801	Yes, it's illegal in the U.S. But it can be done and the person I know who did it had no problems with the medication (in this case, from India), and no problems with Customs or the Postal Inspector, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for medication that is needed to treat serious, life-threatening conditions, because the quality is questionable, but for other medications, I would do it if I didn't live so close to Mexico (where I can just cross the border and buy cheap prescription medication). If you do a Google search for the name of the medication you need, you'll probably find an overseas site offering to sell it. Good luck, but don't forget that it's illegal and can be dangerous for your health.
1802	Although technically the previous answers are correct (you should pay your rent because of the contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and do not pay him! He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a liar, you will not see the whole amount of your deposit returned (typically landlords like him make up reasons such as cleaning bills, delapidation etc in order to retain your money) You're moving out at the end of December anyway and he has no power to just 'throw you out', he'd have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal proceedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc) So, I say sod him!! Good luck x
1803	I've been to Prague, and they're not so uptight about sex in general, the local bars have strippers, etc. You can get an escort in a matter of minutes if you like, but I don't think that's the truth, they're not that bad, I mean, it's just kind of seedy, but I don't really care about that kind of thing as a girl!
1804	It is a matter of faith, a philosophy of life and death, ingrained in us generally as children. Sometimes, our parents' teaching doesn't work, or, as a child, we decide the rules our parents have set up aren't right for us. At other times, our parents don't teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and makes laws (hopefully for the better). Sometimes, people in power get carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler. Legislators try to strike a balance, and who knows better than our legislators how to do that?
1805	Yes, the government grows and distributes it to terminally ill patients,and they can tax it to get this country out of debt.Besides,how many people do you see die from marijuana-related accidents,none,they're only going 10 miles per hour,you can't kill anyone at 10 miles per hour.Canada has a guy named Mark Emery,who is called the "Prince of Marijuana",he made Canada a fortune by selling marijuana seeds,so they have no debt.And the U.S.A. wouldn't have as many drug crimes,and if it helps sick people,I'm for it.With the pain Busch & our government put the American people through,we need something to help us cope.
1806	I personally believe that guns are bad, they should only be used by police, not ordinary citizens. I've lost my brother in an accident with a gun, and knowing that, depending on where you live, anyone can buy a gun without any license at all is making me shudder with frustration and disbelief! I've just seen a TV news report that even owning a fake gun, like the famous paintball guns, can lead to serious violence and even death, in some cases, people were accidentally killed or seriously injured while playing among themselves, or in other cases, police officers shot them in error because they thought they were pointed at them with a real gun... Let's leave guns to those who know how to use them, so that we can protect law-abiding citizens everywhere!
1807	I am surprised you are consulting a lawyer on this, because it would cost you a lot of money. Small claims court is made for people like you, with a case small enough that lawyers shouldn't be involved. Sue. In your complaint, state the facts of your case, and then ask for an alternative measure. For example, ask that the car be transferred to your name, and then state that if the court denies you the car, you want all payments made on the car back. If the facts are true, the court will almost certainly grant you one of those two measures, possibly with interest.
1808	I checked the laws, and they say that the town can recover expenses incurred by the town "in connection with a charge for which a person was sentenced to county jail", as defined more fully in the statute. But, the statute is clear, that a conviction is necessary. If you're not charged, or if you're not found guilty, then the town can't recover. If you're found guilty, and sentenced to county jail, then you have to pay. If you've negotiated a plea deal, and you've been sentenced to "time served", then the town can recover. If you've been in jail for four months, you've either been found guilty, or you couldn't make bail while you waited for trial. If you've been found guilty, even with a plea bargain, you probably owe the money.
1809	The reason lawyers are motivated is money and power. Without legal disputes, such as civil cases, there would be a dramatic decrease in the need for those lawyers.
1810	Civil marriage, that is, the license you get when you marry, is not in any way, shape or form a religious act. It is, therefore, controlled by the state and the state has the right and responsibility to define it. I do not think it should do so in a way that is obviously discriminatory against a group such as homosexuals, but it is certainly within the state's prerogative to define marriage. If you find a church that agrees, you can have a wedding ceremony with whomever or whatever you choose, but only the state can decide whether to recognise it.
1811	No, there are many programs designed to help felons get back on their feet. Perhaps, depending on the field you're interested in, you could go back to school, and the taxpayer will pay for it. You should contact your local Department of Social Services or Department of Children and Youth, and they'll point you to where all this information is available to you. Good luck!
1812	You can see that video and a lot of others on that topic at my link, which I usually consider propaganda. Of course, I also consider everything coming out of the White House on this topic propaganda. There are facts that will never be known, there are too many inconsistencies on both sides of the argument to make an informed decision one way or another.
1813	As we all know, the terrorists were created by Pakistan, at least the ones active in India, by the government that was in power before. Now, as the current government tries to bridge the gap between the two nations, trying to bring them closer, the terrorists are afraid of losing their jobs, so they're turning against Pakistan now. I think it'll be a while before all the terrorists are eliminated if this process continues.
1814	No, cops need the house owner's permission to search, not warrant or reasonable suspicion that somebody's life is in danger.
1815	The fact is, there's no "one man, one vote" and that's not the way it was from the start. Now it's more and more obvious that our government is really about "one dollar, one vote." That's how a republic works, so save your money and become one of the wealthy. That's all you need to do to succeed. Our government doesn't have power, it's just a facade.
1816	It's not like a prize or a UPS package that you can accept on behalf of someone. A subpoena is a very important document sent by the courts, and the specific destination is the person in question, not his dog or girlfriend or stupid coworkers. By accepting this stupid slip, you made it easy for the server to casually claim that he "served" the document to the person in question, when in fact he did not. To make a similar analogy, would you have accepted someone's document if it had been a lawsuit? Would you have been so nosy about someone? The fact is, that person can deny that he was served, because you have no real authority to give subpeonas. He can say you burned it and he never got it (no signatures that he himself received anything), and you could be in deep water for that court offense, including possible jail. So, yes, he has a decent right to be angry at you. I would, too.
1817	Because Jr. doesn't realize, despite being told and swearing twice, that his job is to protect and defend the United States Constitution. He thinks it's about a bunch of other things. If you watch him talk for a while, he'll tell you what his job is, usually something like, "leading," or "sharing my thoughts," or "uniting Americans behind my common cause," or some other bullshit, never actually protecting and defending the Constitution. So in answer to your question, Jr. thinks it's his job to decide if homosexuals can get married, because he really, really doesn't know what his job is.
1818	If that amount can be reasonably calculated, then I don't see a problem with a legislature passing such a law. It's in line with the Fifth Amendment's takings clause, and if the state chooses to treat towns well, that can't be bad. The only downside is the cost of litigation, when many people sue towns and counties to get back what they think they might have lost, based on what some zoning code did in another part of town. But that's just a matter of writing the law smartly and not allowing such legal loopholes.
1819	I consider myself to be pro-choice. I'd never judge or criticize someone who'd had an abortion, but I know in my heart it's wrong and not an option for me. But I'd rather these women who are determined to do it, would go to a clean, sterilized facility, not some rusty shack, and put their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, etc. I think they all know it's wrong. They aren't motivated to have an abortion bc it's moral. I think they choose to because of situational factors. And I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their option, but they felt that was their only way out.
1820	I'm not sure what your post was about, but these are questions you should ask your lawyer. It is his job to explain the consequences of accepting any settlement offer. Write down all your questions, and then meet with your lawyer and ask him. Generally, the lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 of 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending upon the terms of your engagement with him. So, it's most likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will get $20,000, part of which will go to the lawyer to pay his fee.
1821	You know, "allow" is freedom, which is all that a government should give you, and that same "allow" is the reason that people can do whatever they like with themselves, buy whatever they like.
1822	It seems you need a new lawyer, and a bail bondsman. First of all, this is enough to bring charges against the lawyer, the notary, your mom, and yourself. All together, this crime is a conspiracy! This is against most state laws regarding notaries, lawyer responsibilities, not to mention fraud, forgery, and fraudulent schemes. If you want to correct this situation, I would certainly be the first to inform the authorities.
1823	First of all, I would point out that it is commonplace for a lawyer to act as a notary. Before you call someone unethical, you should have a factual basis for your claim. You do not. Secondly, I notice you are very interested in your mother having the quitclaim deed signed "for her own personal gain." I assume you despise people who do things for personal gain. Well, then, kid, what are you doing this for? For YOUR personal gain? Guess what that makes you?
1824	Of course they would, if they were in a position where they didn't wish to have a baby. But when many pro-lifers are in that position, they're trying to say, "I'm not like other women, because this or that happened, so I had an abortion." It's usually okay with them, but they're against abortion when it's someone else.
1825	It's not right, and there are laws in our country that allow our government to fine an alien $250,000, plus jail time, then deportation. And there are laws that prevent employers from hiring illegal workers. All of them must comply with the current laws. You're right. If you or I disobeyed the laws as these people do, we'd be in jail for years. It's not right.
1826	That would depend on whether the person was sent to a professional in the field where the evaluation was conducted. In some cases the judge may send the person for re-evaluation if he or she considers the person who gave the evaluation to be biased in favour of the test subject. But, no, a person cannot be re-evaluated solely to satisfy the desires of the judge or anyone else.
1827	Since she's a family member, talk to her privately and tell her to end it. Threaten to tell the entire family if she doesn't give back what she took, not just from you but from everyone in your family. Don't believe the sob story that she needs counseling. If there's a legitimate reason, then you need to be tough but fair. This isn't how people behave, especially with family. Avoid getting the police involved if you can help it. Change the locks and tell her she's no longer welcome at your home.
1828	The reason it was illegal in the first place was that the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel motors, and the oil lobby, together with the media, who made profits from the logging of forests, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as part of the taxation law, which introduced the name "marijuana", so nobody would realize that they were restricting the use of cannabis.
1829	I'm not sure the separation of church and state has anything to do with tax exemption. If a preacher is teaching the Bible, that's fine, but pastors like Rod Parsley, who have been expressing their political views for years, and allowing candidates to speak at their pulpit, should lose their tax exemption status immediately, not to mention the fact that he's a millionaire.
1830	Unless the federal government is directly controlled, states and localities have the power to make such laws within their own jurisdictions, which usually reflect local perceptions of decency and civility. In the last 30 years, these laws have been significantly relaxed, for example, most people do not dress up for church or dinner, and society has come to respect those who wish to dress differently. Those who wish to dress differently should be realistic about the extent of their difference, and not anticipate that any style will be warmly accepted, particularly as regards clothing that expresses sexual mores.
1831	I'm not sure, but I find it hilarious that the UK wastes so much money on the royal family. I mean, I wouldn't be laughing if I were British, but since I'm not, I'm not, and they can talk about Bush all they want. At least we elected him. What do they call it over there, "Divine Right?" I'm glad my tax dollars aren't going to pay for skiing trips, drinking binges, designer clothes, passionate love affairs, expensive cars, castles and God knows what else.
1832	The trouble is, until these people are actually charged and convicted of a crime, they can't be simply dismissed, unless the House approves it by a supermajority.
1833	We are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. Think about this, how is killing different from other crimes? What alternatives are there to capital punishment? Why do we not use and advertise their usage more?--"You kill someone in the state of Texas, We'll kill you back" Ron White-- --Food for Thought
1834	Theology seems to have a very low fruit; the few theologians who have been significant have only produced works that are worth under the umbrella of philosophical thought. Theologians are often bad philosophers, like Aquinas. Theology is a third rate philosophy, as it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims, which makes it *objectively* less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy. Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics and related subjects provide the basis for legitimate and fruitful discussion of religions.
1835	I'm not sure it's worth living a life of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly questioning when it's all going to end. I'd rather live in a simulation, which might be a terrible and difficult life, but might also be a happy life, which would be very hard to achieve in the real world. We're just souls hooked into a life support system, and if my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulation of my brain, rather than "real" experiences, that'll be all right.
1836	I am a heterosexual man, and I cannot find any reason to condemn homosexuality as immoral. I do not believe that all of the Bible is true, and thus, the Bible does not convince me. Additionally, if something is wrong, there should be observable reasons in reality, so the justification for homosexuality being wrong should deal strictly with observable reality. The most commonly used argument is that homosexuality is not natural. However, this assumes that what is natural is good. This does not seem to be true to me. Vaccines are not natural, and they are not condemned. Computers are unnatural, and yet they are not condemned. The act does not hurt anyone. Provide an argument showing that homosexuality is an inherently immoral act rooted in logic.
1837	Cosleeping is dangerous. Children roll or fall out of bed. Having a child in bed also destroys intimacy between parents. It's difficult to get a kid to stay away from your bed anyway. If you let them for a while then stop them, it'll be much more difficult later. Basinets aren't much of an inconvenience. Keep them by your bed to make feeding easy. They're small enough to fit almost anywhere. There are also basinets that are attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.
1838	I believe businesses should not (but not to the extent that it is enforced by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and military personnel. Forgive me, but does reaching the arbitrary age of 65 and having a more difficult job entitle you to discounts at movie theaters and restaurants? Or is it simply a way of saying "Thanks." Military personnel seem to already get tax-free goods on base. There are many hard jobs out there that bring great value but do not get discounts. What about farmers? They feed us well. Doctors? They keep us healthy. Scientists? Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our everyday lives.
1839	A long time ago Putin ordered all government officials to close offshore accounts, ordered all government officials to buy Russian cars, and wealthy Russians used other countries to avoid paying taxes. Now the US and EU are sanctioning businesses and individuals, I'm trying to keep up with all the sanctions, but I'm losing track. Europe buys much needed gas from Russia, and in turn, Russia buys things from Europe. They have a nice little ecosystem. So I think this will hurt Europe more in the long run, and help Russia, because Putin can use this to rein in his corrupt officials and tax skater billionaires. Don't rely on foreign business, and don't use tax havens, because they will be sanctioned or frozen. This is just my opinion, I'd like to hear other opinions. Thanks.
1840	I've heard that if we just ignore WBC, they'll go away and disappear. I don't believe that. They'll be in our history books, despite what people want, because they've attracted enough attention to be included there. I don't mean that I agree with them, but one thing that's good about their existence is extremism. I think we should study it more. It pushes people to do crazy things and we seem to be blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick, so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds that they're right and we're wrong. If we study extremism, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for people who seem to win over nations, races, and societies and cause them to do horrific things.
1841	My dad is 28 years older than my mom, and he met her when she was 17, and I have a half-brother who's older than my mom. My friend and I had an argument about a 34-year-old teacher from our school who sextinged a student, and she sexting back, and I didn't understand the big deal, because there were bigger problems in the world, and I grew up believing that age didn't matter in intimacy, but she and all the girls in the group text did. Why am I wrong?
1842	I've read the 1972 study "Limits to Growth" and subsequent books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and others on the problems and limitations of capitalism and consumer society. Recently, I learned that George Mitchell, the inventor of frack drilling, had a series of conferences in Houston, Texas, focused on the "Limits to Growth" study. It was astonishing to me that someone of such wealth and power would be fundamentally critical of the system that made him so rich. I can't imagine oil executives having such an opinion today.
1843	I know that sour cream is already available in a squeezable container, but I think that this should be the default container. Usually, it's sold in a cup container with lid, like yogurt. But, most of the time, it'd be better to use a squeezable container, like ketchup or mustard. Sure, sometimes it's better to use a yogurt container, because it's easier to use a spoon, but most of the time, it's used as an additive, which is much easier to use with a squeezing action.
1844	I think the current driving age, 16 is too young, and teenagers are dangerous drivers. They're notorious for bad decisions, and the fact that there are more and more accidents caused by texting proves that they can't drive safely. Raising the driving age would make driving safer overall, and also stop teenagers from engaging in illegal activities such as drinking or using illegal drugs. Car crashes happen frequently, and keeping kids off the road will make it safer for them and for adults who need to use cars.
1845	The title is fairly self explanatory. The latest post on the front page of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, people with God kill people" has led me to write this CMV. I am not a religious man, so I don't feel this is a biased CMV. I think saying "Guns don't kill people, People with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people". I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect. It harbours hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own. Change my view.
1846	I'm not sure why, but I completely feel that if you're making a fortune in the worst job on earth, you should be happy. For instance, if I were making $100,000 a year in a job that I wasn't necessarily happy with, I'd rather that than a job where I made $60,000-70,000 a year and enjoyed my eight-hour workday. I feel this way because, in my opinion, if you make a fortune in a job that you don't really enjoy, your time off will be better spent because you'll have the money to do whatever you want, whereas if you're happy with your job but you don't have the things you want in life, you'll be more satisfied with your life. I feel that I'm in a really important turning point in my life, and I want to make sure I take advantage of every opportunity that comes my way.
1847	I've been wondering about this lately. Jimmy Page has given several interviews recently where he says he's never refused to criticize mp3s, but I'm willing to wager that if you put him in a proper experimental setting, he'd have a hard time hearing any difference at all, at 256kbps or higher. He mentioned that the new Led Zepplin deluxe reissues would come with download cards for all tracks, which is fine with me. But I still don't like mp3s, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob, probably as many people are, and I love my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold CDs, or LPs, but my ears probably can't tell the difference. And certainly I love plugging an iPod full of mp3s into my fancy car audio system.
1848	I'm sure politicians don't know how to run a country. We've seen over and over again that politicians are unable to prevent corruption, bankruptcies worldwide, and nations failing to maintain a healthy economy. Most solutions come from a meeting of politicians, where they reunite and discuss these solutions, but most of the time they don't manage to put them into practice. In the early 1900s there was a movement called Technocracy movement, which wanted to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each field they were running (e.g. education would be run by someone connected to it, who had spent a majority of her life studying education). I believe our political system isn't functioning as it should. CMV P.S. English isn't my mother tongue, I hope I've made my point.
1849	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health had been a bigger issue and looked at more closely then the shooting potentially would not have happened. I'm all for feminism, do recognize that women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. CMV.
1850	I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm preaching, but I would really like to hear more about this topic and maybe CMV.
1851	Why didn't the "true" gods of today's religions choose to reveal themselves to the earliest people of Mesopotamia? If he wasn't really jealous, wouldn't he have revealed himself sooner? If he wasn't really jealous, then why did he let us wander around for so long, worshiping "false gods"? How can we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped weren't sitting "up there" seriously angry, that we claim each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is really just one effort of one god, angry, that after explicitly putting their word out, we strayed and worshiped false idols?
1852	Miscommunication is the root of all problems, because car crashes caused by drivers unaware of what other drivers are doing, things turning into gossip because someone didn't take the time to explain everything, fights caused by two people who didn't understand the rules of the game, terrorists blowing people up because the government didn't listen to their concerns in the first place, and there are many more.
1853	Welfare is a way of taxing people more, making them spend less, making businesses less profitable. It's a way of making people happy with where they are.
1854	The evidence from countries where drinking is socially acceptable from an early age is very strong, that there are significantly lower rates of alcohol-related diseases and deaths. If drinking is integrated into society, at age 18, 19, or 21, it can significantly reduce binge drinking. Furthermore, these extra years of sales of alcohol can increase tax revenues and fund programmes to help people suffering from alcoholism recover.
1855	I've been on this forum early, nice, another color forum. I'm guessing you said excite. I've never really liked this color, since when I was a kid it made me think of blood and murder. But as I've gotten older, I've come to like it more. Yellow makes me happy, but red is much more striking and, possibly, exciting. It's also the color of fire trucks and letter boxes and...
1856	This argument is very close to me, an ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old, has had unprotected sex with a minor, who isn't even fully developed yet, and he sees no wrong in it, even though he is: a. Breaking the law. b. Being aware that he is breaking the law. c. Proud of it. Personally, I think that it isn't that difficult to wait until you're 16, after all, if teenagers are sexually active at such a young age, it could cause problems such as teenage pregnancy, STD's, and even permanent damage to their bodies. Personally, I see it as a bad thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreparable mental and physical damage and is simply morally wrong.
1857	Adam always had the choice of good or evil, and he chose evil. His choice damaged his relationship with God, and he created a bad world. Now man still has the liberty of doing whatever he likes, but the problem is that he just wants to rebel and do evil. Look at the evidence. But God has a remedy for evil, Jesus Christ. Repent and believe in Him.
1858	I admit that we are Homo sapiens, and that we belong to the animal kingdom, so we're animals, but how can we be "above" an animal? What defines "above"? Should there be some kind of intelligence threshold that prevents us from being classified as animals? How does higher intelligence make us superior to animals? Would an extremely intelligent dolphin no longer be classified as an animal?
1859	This artwork is a call to action in the UK to end the government's Big Brother program. London's Westminster Council are adding to the problem that people don't believe the government and their surveillance of British people by removing something that most people love and want to keep.
1860	The children of Status Quo are experiencing the wrong meaning of Christmas, as a recent survey shows that most children think of Christmas as a gift day, or a day when parents give them whatever they want, which clearly should not be the case. Christmas should be about Jesus' birth, and when Santa Clause is introduced, children, and even adults, start to see him as a symbol of Christmas, and not Christ. It's as if at a birthday party, everyone pays attention to somebody other than the birthday boy or girl, and that's clearly wrong. It's just like that which is happening at Status Quo.
1861	I agree that legalizing performance-enhancing drugs is an absurd idea. Firstly, they harm the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the players' health because they are too young to understand the consequences. Secondly, these athletes are role models for too many young children. Do you want kids to go around pretending to have high pitch voices and pretending to have breasts? That will encourage the use of steroids by younger kids because their favorite athlete is encouraging them. Moreover, if performance-enhancing drugs were legalized, all athletes would start using them regardless of whether they want to or not, because they will feel that they need to use them just to compete with other athletes.
1862	It was an economic superpower of Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new military tactics, new scientific inventions, a global economic power (before the war). There was no competition. Nazi Germany won.
1863	This is a very delicate subject, much more so than most non-Canadians would think... French nationalists aren't objecting to his performance because of its artistic quality, which they would have had a very valid point about, but because of his nationality, when he really wanted to celebrate the history of an important place... In fact, I think the best way to celebrate Quebec City's "birthday" would be to build a huge statue of the father of Canada, General Wolfe, on the Plains of Abraham!
1864	This is a very difficult choice, as these are two of my favorite bands. I'd say Queen wins, because their anthems (We'll Rock You, We're the Champions, etc..) will last longer than the band is forgotten, and their music covers a wider range of themes and ideas. Pearl Jam is technically good, but Queen is more musically superior.
1865	By deciding where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations and groups are most relevant to a specific neighborhood, so that precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to people.
1866	It's a great game, but it's also the most popular one of all time, and it's the one that introduced me to the Zelda series. It's a great example of how a 3D game can be done very well, and it's a huge world that can be explored, and it's a very interesting story, and it's the first game that I got addicted to.
1867	I'll start.Obviously,I don't know if I'd be able to do this if I were in your shoes,but I'm willing to consider the possibility.If I had early alzheimer's or some other form of mental decline,I would have considered ending my life.The ability to maintain a constant consciousness is the thing that keeps me alive.When I lose my grip on reality,forget who I am,what I am,what I believe,I cease to be myself.
1868	The average American salary is $32,000. The average teacher's salary is $53,000, including benefits. In Wisconsin, the total salary is $75,000. That's a large amount of money for someone, especially since mediocre teachers are practically impossible to get rid of. Teachers should be paid and rewarded according to performance, not how long they've been in school. I recommend watching the film "Waiting for Superman," which reveals many flaws in our failing public school system. The US should have the highest test scores, but due to the fact that we have an abundance of average teachers who can't be fired, we don't. Instead, we have some of the lowest scores.
1869	Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct? Just because one man has a feeling that all matter warps space-time doesn't make it true. Think about it...get ready... this is the theory... all matter is bad. Literally! This theory states that all matter is bad, and all other matter just seems to attract, like the "ultimate sagging mattress" that is often alluded to. Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it.
1870	We have one of the strongest navies on earth, and right now we have 366 ships in service. We have four ships in this area that are at risk of being attacked by pirates, and that area covers THOUSANDS of nautical miles. Can a mere four ships effectively protect that large area of sea? Not really. Why can't the world's strongest navy spare a few more ships to protect trade routes and countries in this area, or would they rather keep those four ships in place and hope they don't get attacked again? I'd prefer the first option. Hundreds of ships pass through these waters daily, some of them with a view to providing aid to third world countries. Is it really politically correct to allow these trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Not really.
1871	There's no disagreement, but I disagree. There's a good chance something will start between the U.S. and Iran. Iran and many Arab/Muslim nations despise the West and support terrorists, so if there's a massive attack in the next couple of years, Iran will be the primary target. Also, people need to realize that Israel's interests are America's interests; they're the same. So even if we don't go to war with Iran directly, there's a good chance Israel will, which would involve us. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for this for quite some time, and hopefully people will see just how dangerous a group they are and how inaccurate their predictions were. I hope it doesn't happen, but our foreign policy in the Mideast will not change, so war and conflict seem inevitable.
1872	My husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi we'd ever had, and he added, "And I've had a lot of sushi." Seriously, don't go to any of the overpriced restaurants in Vegas or to any of those places that serve deep fried cream cheese rolls. Go to Boulder City and eat here. It's worth the price of the rental car.
1873	I'm a businessman on Craig Street and sometimes I have to eat at this place. Yesterday was one of those days. The staff is so rude, they barely look at you, and the food they give you isn't good enough for your dog. Forget what I just said, don't go, run for your life.
1874	I had a really great experience here, I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro without the cheese and it was vegan. The pasta was perfect and that was enough for me to give it five stars. However, our server Alyssa was amazing. She was very attentive, knew what was vegan on the menu and always made sure we had drinks filled. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great meal and great service.
1875	Slow service, overpriced, strange chairs with wheels on them. I've had a few sashimi selections which were alright, but not worth the price tag. I've also had beef noodle dishes which were alright, too. Two glasses of wine for $13! Six of us ate there, nothing special, two wine, two beers, $174 before tip. Don't bother.
1876	I'm not a frequent visitor of Jack in the Box, but I've never really had a bad experience with them. This last visit has been my last visit. I walked in twice and last time it took me about 15 minutes to get a single jumbo jack, and it wasn't busy. Today it took three minutes and I was the only person in line and two people looked right at me and didn't take my order before I left. Management should consider changing their staff. Five guys will continue to get my business over you, they seem to take less time and they're a walk-in burger joint.
1877	The atmosphere here was very nice and a good date spot. The menu was a bit confusing because it was in Italian, but the waiter was happy to help. I got the seafood linguine which was a popular dish. The food took a while to arrive, but we did get free bread with olive oil which was quite hard and dry, so I did not really like it and didn't eat it. When we got the food, we were quite disappointed by the portion, as it was expensive for the small portion we got. We easily demolished the noodles in 5 minutes and felt hungry even after spending around $25. The noodles themselves were very tasty and flavorful, but definitely not worth the price, so only come if you're willing to splurge or have a small stomach. Overall, I would not come back due to the high price tag and the small portions.
1878	This buffet is the worst I've ever been to. The food was very bland, the selection was small, the salads were wilted, there wasn't any vegetables in sight, the gravy was congealed and the roast beef was the size of my fist, which they cut into 2 thin slices. It was also extremely overpriced for a Tuesday night. I would rather go to Mandarin.
1879	I think school uniforms are very comfortable and effective in many ways. If they're wearing just jeans every day, they're thinking about the brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible, so the poor students might feel inferior. Even though school uniforms are very expensive, they're cheaper than jeans. They feel a sense of belonging and community. In my case, school uniforms are convenient. During my student years, I don't have to worry about my clothes.
1880	We're talking about schools destroying creativity, and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction.
1881	There's no need to give up independence when they're young and trying to find themselves.
1882	I'm not sure school uniforms are a good idea, because it's too much work to wash them and it's difficult to put on so many layers in the morning.
1883	I love Firefox, and I'm fond of this site, but it's not very clear to me. This one's better: theworlddebating.com
1884	It's easy to change the configuration of Firefox to suit changing needs, for example when I need some great SEO extensions, or when I need an HTML color picker instead, when I start working on other parts of web development, it's easy to resize Firefox to suit changing needs.
1885	Firefox has user-made extensions that serve the user community, so it's better.
1886	No, I'd never turn in my spouse, I'd just say, you said I was involved, and we're going our separate ways. But in all honestly, I wouldn't even want to know about this in the first place.
1887	No, I'd never say anything to him, because you never know why he'd kill someone, or it might have been self-defense, or whatever. And if people were to question me about anything, I'd know nothing. He's got my trust, and I wouldn't let him down without a reason, plus, his secret's safe with me.
1888	I'm not sure I'd be able to confess to murder if my husband had done it, because my feelings would be more powerful than my fear of having a bad husband, I don't know exactly what my answer would be, but I'm sure I wouldn't be able to look at him every day and pretend everything had not happened, I think my feelings are stronger than anything, and I wouldn't like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to capital punishment or spend his whole life behind bars.
1889	It's a no, if it's someone you love very much and want to spend your whole life with, then it's definitely not. People do make mistakes, but if it's a serious crime to murder someone, I would still not report the person I love most. If I intend to spend my whole life with someone I love, then I will stick with them and never report them, and if that means I'm participating in the murder by not saying anything, then that's fine with me.
1890	Books are always superior to TV, because they impart more knowledge than TV.
1891	Books are better than TV, because TV makes your eyes bad, and kills your imagination! Read Roald Dahl's "Television", and you'll understand everything!
1892	I don't think India, with its rising condition, can replace other developed countries, like America, London, and other countries, because here the majority of people are ill.
1893	I'd say it's better to not have a father than a bad father. You still lose in that case. When you've got a dad, you want him to be the best he can be, so you can learn from him when you grow up. If you've got a bad dad, then what's the point of having a dad at all? He's just going to be a bad dad, and he won't teach you anything. It's always better to have a decent dad in your life than a bad dad.
1894	I'd rather be without a father than a bad one. I don't know how it feels to have a bad one, but I have friends whose dads are always drunk and they don't do anything for them. They sometimes say to me they wish their dad wasn't around. If my dad was like that, I'd think the same thing. At least if I didn't have a dad, I wouldn't know how it feels to be disappointed in him.
1895	Raffles had drawn up a town plan for Singapore, which included separate areas for various racial groups, as well as provision of other facilities such as roads, schools, and land for government buildings.
1896	Even though Raffles dismissed Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, I think it was because Farquhar had taken measures not approved by Raffles. And I think Raffles had dismissed him with the best interests of Singapore's population in mind.
1897	It's as if your cat or dog is trying to understand your income tax return! Evolution and creation are inseparable!
1898	Has man evolved in history? Damn, I've obviously missed that.
1899	Our world might be a huge hologram http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-might-be-a-giant-hologram.html It's extremely probable that we live in a simulated universe
1900	I've been using Firefox for a while, but my system has only 2GB of RAM and I like to run more than one program at a time, so Firefox uses too much memory for its benefits.
1901	Yes, physical education is rewarding for students and teachers, provided it is taught and encouraged properly and is approached with the correct attitude.
1902	If we don't start with a young age, how will we ever reduce child obesity?
1903	It is my opinion that physical education should be obligatory at school, because it will be beneficial for students to become fit and will prevent them from becoming overweight.
1904	With his deeds, Farquhar gained the people's affection and respect. When he was dismissed, thousands of people said goodbye to him on the day he left Singapore. This is a testament to the fact that people regard Farquhar very highly.
1905	William Farquhar had spent more time in Singapore than Raffles, so he had more opportunities to know the people better, to win their confidence, to discover their problems and to solve them.
1906	Then you say it would have been okay if the woman had an abortion right afterward?
1907	Now, in my beloved language, I'll tell you that what they call "bebe, humano" isn't anything more than a plant, menos, I would have to say that all she does is eat resources, just like a plant, but plants give us oxygen. No one knows if it's life, but you can feel, or think, that's what they usually say that she does more for people than animals. Aborto es matar un parásito
1908	It's not about what you decide, it's about "who decides?" A wife isn't yours, nor is she your church, or the state, or the fetus. You don't have the right to force her into servitude.
1909	For me, it's pretty easy: I'm pro-choice because I can choose life, and if I choose life, there's no choice.
1910	Science has proven that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that created the universe.
1911	It is no more wrong than any other way of expression which can be exploited.
1912	Porn isn't bad as long as it's not sick, like child, animal or rape, but other porn is fine as long as it's watched discreetly.
1913	Usually, when I make a decision, it's "yes" or "no", sometimes it's "both", but today, I'm choosing to move forward for the greater good. Choosing to better suit yourself is going to help you in the short term, but in the long run, who will really benefit from that? Compared to moving forward for the greater good, you're helping yourself and other people. If you think about it, we all want the world to be a better place, and if you've noticed, personal endeavors have gotten us into some not so pleasant situations.
1914	I personally believe that sacrificing personal interests for the greater good is more often the right thing to do. I don't know how to prove it, I just know that's how I feel.
1915	Who'd want to get rid of the uniforms of Catholic girls at school?
1916	The school uniform is a great idea, simply because it's impossible to compete in fashion with students. If one student is more wealthy than another, they can start to show off in front of students who are less wealthy, which will create a bad atmosphere at school and lead to arguments between both students. Usually, this happens between girls, although it's not uncommon for boys. That's why the school uniform solves all conflicts.
1917	I think school uniform is a great idea. There's a big gap between the rich and the poor, so they care about the brand and quantity of clothes. Young people are sensible, so they may feel inferior to the less wealthy students. Even though school uniform is very expensive, it's cheaper than plain clothes. They feel closer to each other, and they sense belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. During my student years, I don't need to worry about clothes.
1918	I think it's good to have a school uniform, each school has a uniform that represents its purpose. For example, when I was in school, I wore white shirt and blue skirt. White is peace, and blue is faithfulness. Moreover, identical uniforms remove the barrier between classes, and show that no matter what class you belong to, you're treated equally under one roof.
1919	A bad father can teach you more than good ones, I think, like how not to behave, how not to behave, how not to behave in your family. That's better than no teaching, I guess, because you'll know who he is. And you'll never have to wonder whether your father is a saint or a bad one, because you know.
1920	The production of plastic bottles requires up to 1.5 million tons of plastic waste per year, which is about 47 million gallons of oil per year. Even though the plastic used for the packaging of drinks is of high quality and in demand by recyclers, more than 80% of plastic bottles are simply discarded.
1921	I'm fond of TV. TV's cool, TV's great. TV's as much a baby in my womb as the morning sun is, or the cool, fresh air on your first day at school, or the day you get diagnosed with cancer, or the day you realize you've been wasting your time reading this.
1922	Plastic is good at light weight and is great for diffraction.
1923	It's definitely wrong, and in reality, marriage is intended only for men and women, which is another way of saying, "Produce."
1924	I'm not gay, I'm married, and I've got a daughter.
1925	From a biological point of view, man and woman are "engineered" to be together, but morality and society in our time have corrupted that idea.
1926	It's like saying killing someone is right because there are always people who don't kill.
1927	India is surrounded by water on three sides, something that most countries don't have. This is an enormous advantage for India.
1928	India is moving one step ahead to becoming a world power every day. The concerns of other countries say it all. We have some internal problems that other countries do not, but time is water and brings changes. We are growing as a major power. I will not compare my country to others, as Napoleon said, "Comparing yourself with others is the same as insulting yourself." We have the 3rd biggest army in the world, we produce the most doctors and engineers every year, but we still do not like to criticize ourselves because we do not believe that anyone is stronger or weaker than us. Namaste.
1929	Christianity is in contradiction with history, archaaegic, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It's a rejection of rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are full of contradictions. Arguments in favor of Christianity aren't very convincing (with the exception of one or two, which are rather close). Atheism isn't perfect, but it's the more logical of the two.
1930	That's the distinction between religion and science, science admits it doesn't have all the answers, religion is so dogmatic it doesn't even acknowledge facts, let alone the meaning of truth.
1931	The most important reason to reject any particular deity is that you can replace him with a man who lied to humanity about literally everything he said, and we'd still not know. And that's not all; you can replace him with human lies or hallucinations. There's not a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly not any that came true.
1932	I never did it again after I'd been spanked, so I'd spank my kids out of love, on the butt.
1933	Yes, because that's how the kid learns not to do it again, and I know that from experience.
1934	I'm of the opinion that you should only hit a child when he's wrong, and if he's afraid of making the same mistake again, then he'll understand more.
1935	Faith is one of the cornerstones of Christianity, and just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Gravity, for instance, you can't see, feel, or hear it, but you know it exists.
1936	I'm very fond of Jesus, so I'm on this side.
1937	I'm assuming that everyone on this side of the argument was raised by a Christian family, grow up and ask yourself why you're so in love with a man wearing ragged sandals.
1938	Why are we fighting? The scientologists are on the run, and we must join forces to fight them.
1939	I'm not sure spanking's necessary, spanking'd last a minute, but punishment could last two, three, four weeks, or more.
1940	No, because if we hit our kids, they'll think we're not fond of them.
1941	No,I'm not sure spanking them works,it might have worked once,but as they grow up,it's not a good technique,because then you won't have a good relationship,and your relationship won't grow. There are other techniques they can learn.
1942	Not all starts with violence, parents shouldn't hit their kids to discipline them, only when necessary.
1943	I disagree with parents using spanking as a way of disciplining their children, because kids won't be scared of what their parents tell them, and also because when you do that, your kids learn what your parents tell them, and also because it doesn't help your kids very much.
1944	I'd answer "yes" under certain circumstances, but in others, "no." For instance, if my spouse killed someone in self-defense or in defense of somebody else, then no. But if they killed someone for killing somebody else, or something like that, then yes. If they killed someone coldly, for money, objects, or simply out of pure dislike for them, then yes. Because someone that cold could kill me.
1945	I'd have to say yes, I would have turned in my spouse. There's no way of knowing if they killed once, they wouldn't kill again. And there's no way of knowing if you're not their next target. If they were ever paranoid about being caught, they could have blown up their brains, because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be difficult to turn in your spouse, but it's what you need to do for your own safety.
1946	Murder is wrong, under any circumstances, and the person who does it knows the consequences and is guilty. I'd never look at my wife the way I used to, and I couldn't live with the secret of the murder.
1947	We're not the ones who created this baby, we're not the ones who brought it to life, why should we be the ones to kill it? We don't have the right to.
1948	Reagan once said, "Observe that all those who are in favor of abortion were born."
1949	As long as it's not a disease, we should all be okay with it. It's not our business!
1950	Isn't it stated in the Declaration of Independence that we have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?
1951	I care more about personal goals, because each person is accountable to themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good is simply a way of preventing some people from having to work less hard for the same thing, because of something you did. Personal goals are never unequal. You can always go as deep into the hole as you like, but standing on your own, rather than with a group, you might be able to go faster if you were alone.
1952	For example, if you're not living together, how are you going to help somebody else with theirs? If you're still living with your mom, and you don't have a job, and you want to help somebody else by giving to an organization, you can't do it.
1953	It's easier to get most people to pursue their own interests than it is to get most people to pursue the common good, which is why communism failed.
1954	Yes, it's illegal. The consequences will be that you and your friend clean up the mess. Like when people use toilet paper. A few years ago, my brother and I were doing this in chalk on garage doors, and, long story short, we were caught and had to clean up every garage door. Have fun. :) ps. I keep reading some of these answers (HAHA)...you won't go to juvenile jail, and you won't be charged as long as it's not bad words. Just act like a teenager.
1955	It's true that when the Nazis came to power, they banned private possession of firearms. There's a reason for that; when they wanted to break into a house and take people without due process of law, they didn't wanna have anyone who could fight back. It's also true that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Now, some people would say no, outlaws and police. I say that at that point, those two groups are indistinguishable. Do you honestly believe that every cop in your city is honest and fair?
1956	That's a great question. Ideals only work in ideal worlds. In our real world, it's more common that a poor person will get a misdemeanor than a wealthy one, so effectively, when ex-felons aren't allowed to vote, poor communities aren't represented. Read some of the articles on the difference between de facto and de jure; I'm sure you'll find that fascinating and enlightening.
1957	No, you're still obliged to pay your rent,but there are some things you can do if the landlord doesn't fix it: Take the rent when it's due to the local clerk of courts. The tenant must have the rent current at the clerk of courts, which is called the rent deposit. The tenant doesn't need an attorney to do this. Go to court and ask the landlord to fix it. The court can also lower the rent until the repairs are made or give the tenant some of the rent to cover the cost of the repairs. End the lease. Cancel the lease and move out, but only if the tenant has given the required notice and the landlord hasn't fixed it.
1958	Even if adultery is illegal where you live, and you might have a claim of alienation of affection, this woman didn't come to your house. Your husband invited her, and they didn't kiss, your husband kissed, and she didn't get pregnant. Your husband got pregnant, so make sure you divorce him, and get a good settlement, maintenance, and child support. The best revenge is a life well lived.
1959	I suppose it depends on the terms of the contract. It may require mutual satisfaction or give you the right to require them to be redone. Probably you will have to pay anyway. However, the problem may not be best solved by your "legal recourse." If you haven't already, tell the designer how unhappy you are and why, and ask for them to be redone. It may be that the designer works with you to redo the work -- it would be in his/her best interest in the long run to see that his/her customers are happy with the design.
1960	Your question isn't very valid, because the word was used by some people specifically as an insult to describe "some other people." Your question would have been more valid if you had asked "why did white people decide to use that word in the first place?" We know that black people use it within their own community, just as gay people use the word "queer." But that doesn't change the fact that the word was first used deliberately as an insult.
1961	That's the number of people that live in a little Manhattan. Most towns with more spread out populations do not clean their streets as often.
1962	Okay, my friend, he's an adult, and I assume you're a minor. First of all, he shouldn't have put you in this criminal situation in the first place. Obviously, he didn't care enough about you to avoid going to jail, so I would let him sit there and think about what he did. If he's any kind of person, he should apologize to you.
1963	I don't think so, not in a civilised society, if he's sentenced to capital punishment, there'll be more violence, hatred, and bloodshed. For serious crimes, I believe a life sentence in prison is the appropriate punishment, I don't understand how killing someone makes any difference.
1964	It seems to me that the fact that the brain's development isn't complete at 18 for some people, so there's a risk of more serious damage when they drink.
1965	Yes, and they need to be reduced now. The Department of Children and Family Services in my state is a mess, destroying families without any real evidence, doing the children more harm than good by taking them out of their homes, keeping them apart from their families, and basically terrorizing everyone, including the children. I've seen many families destroyed, my son is one of them, and it seems that there's no way to deal with them except to let them play their god games and bow low at every opportunity. Even saying "DHS" in connection with this case lost one set of grandparents' right to visit their grandchildren, which is way, way beyond their original job.
1966	All of them, which is why it's called rape, because if it wasn't rape, there wouldn't be any court cases. But the issue here is whether or not the courts will convicted the real rapist. But there might be a fine line between statutary rape, where the alleged victim has given consent, or even initiated the relationship, which I don't know about.
1967	Many of these answers talk about the woman's ability to choose what happens to her body, but what about the baby's? No baby could decide, "I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I might have lived outside my mother's body), stabbed in the skull and drained of my brain." How selfish are these women who think this all about them and what they need or want? People who support this should be forced to watch one of these performed live!
1968	It is possible, but it depends on the practice of the particular courthouse or judge. Many federal courts require people with cell phones, pagers, blackberries, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service. If the judge has a standing policy against such things in his courtroom, whether you are in court or not, you could be held in contempt. My guess is that most judges wouldn't go as far as to hold someone in contempt if it was off. But I've personally seen a person's phone get confiscated because there was a concern that the person was trying to take pictures of witnesses with it in a drug case (witness intimidation).
1969	I think this whole thing is a bit shady. The addition isn't legal if it's not built on the right foundations, and if it's not built with planning permission, then it's not legal. The letter you write should say that the property has been built only for the time it has been built, and that it should be inspected because it doesn't have the right foundations. If you write an incorrect letter and the truth comes out, then you could be in trouble. This is a minefield, so either stay out of it or involve the town hall. You should also involve the real estate agent, because he could get into a lot of trouble.
1970	I think you're most annoyed with the inconsistency of the laws. We have laws that are supposed to protect us from harming ourselves, but we haven't legislated all forms of self-mutilation. The thing I find most annoying is that we pass these laws to save lives, but I think the real reason is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers from picking up the cost of a person's health care if they choose to self-mutilate. For instance, seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use. If we were just honest, and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
1971	Democracy cannot be exported by force, because it takes the will of the people to form such a government. Muslim countries do not have the same Enlightenment level as the United States, where we were able to form a secular constitutional republic. Islam demands that church and state be in unity, with the rule of law coming from the Koran. Despite the efforts of some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and government, where citizens can follow the dictate of their conscience. Islam needs to go through its own Enlightenment before any type of Western democracy has a chance to succeed, and until then we can only keep a weak control by military force, which causes blowback, as we now see in the Mideast.
1972	As far as your situation is concerned, I wish you luck in finding real love, it's possible and it's possible at 50, but if you don't believe in the one you love, then leave. Lying has no place in a relationship.
1973	I can't give you any advice, but if he refuses to take a drug test, then he's probably not getting custody. The judge might order a drug test if you mention drugs in the case. If he doesn't obey the court order, then he won't get custody. I've dealt with custody battles many times in my work, and they're never pleasant. I wish you luck.
1974	Please note that there are many illegal immigrants in our prisons, in our jails, for raping, murder, drug trafficking, stealing. Because they're illegally crossing the border, that means criminals are crossing it too. Without a system, anyone can come in, no matter how sick or bad. Surprisingly, not all illegal immigrants are honest and hard working.
1975	It's a bit pointless and egotistical to do that. The point of this site is to gather information from different points of view, and let others decide how valuable the content is. Voting for your own answer defeats the point, so it's definitely unethical, and probably against Yahoo!'s rules, too. I can't imagine anyone feeling that they've won by voting for their own answer, it's so childish. There are no prizes and bragging rights here, we just try to share our experience and information.
1976	This issue has already been decided by the Supreme Court, and as long as the First Amendment is not changed, abortion should be legal.
1977	To answer another person's question, cigarette ban would save lives and money for many people, save hospitals thousands of patients who get cancer from cigarettes. It doesn't seem like a loss of money, it's just lives and money. Besides, cigarette industry deserves to collapse. I'd love to see that day. All those sluts who sell death deserve to be unemployed. Not teachers, medical personnel, or firefighters. All those who support cigarette legality are losers.
1978	I believe that this is really two distinct issues, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Clearly, Brown v. Board has succeeded in integrating America as a whole, not just in the education system, but in general, reversing the previous Supreme Court decision of "equal but distinct". However, I believe there is still a need for more, primarily due to geographic and financial constraints, which are disproportionate to schools in wealthy, mostly suburban areas compared to poor, mostly city areas. It is easy to argue that the system is no longer separated, but still unequal, because of the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any bias.
1979	Tell them exactly what you wrote here, and they should let you off or reschedule you. I was summoned while I was in college, and they waived or excused me twice for that reason. If you're studying, they'll excuse you, so you don't miss any lessons. You shouldn't have a problem with that.
1980	Yes, in North Carolina, you have to wait three days before you buy a pistol. But that's only after you've spent your working day taking a state-mandated firearms safety course, visited your county sheriff's office, filled out all the forms required to do a background check and FBI search, and applied for a pistol purchase. In the meantime, you could buy as many as you like from a street corner in one day and be done with it. Criminals are in the driver's seat of this country. Why do they make honest people go through all this trouble to get a pistol? I know other states are even more difficult to deal with, New York is the hardest. They want to make good people not want to own a pistol. Why isn't there a national standard for gun laws? Shouldn't individual states be allowed to make their own laws on issues that are directly from the Constitution?
1981	I'm afraid the main problem with trust is a flawed criminal justice system. Law must be swift, severe, and guaranteed: People sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists are released on probation with treatment, not punishment, and you can commit the same crime twice, one gets you probation, the other gets you 20 years. I think people won't believe in a system that is efficient enough to "correct" anyone. Unfortunately, our system is unique in the world, it's a system that would literally let 10 guilty people go rather than send one innocent person to jail, which I can't argue with, but hopefully, in the future, people will see that this is a mess and somebody will fix it.
1982	Before you hire an attorney, contact the business and inform them of the incident, ask for their insurance company's name. Often they will make a fair offer, such as a doctor's bill plus $1,000. If they refuse, then you should consider speaking to an attorney only if your damages and losses exceed your state's maximum small claims award by $1,000. If you aren't injured and received medical care, your case is weak. Damages for pain and suffering in this type of incident will be around $1,000 unless you can prove negligence or malice. If you hire an attorney, it is likely you won't have enough money left over to cover your medical bills.
1983	Mexicans are not persecuted in America, even illegal ones. Although there's been a growing public sentiment against illegals in recent weeks, I'd blame it on the media or politicians who've been making it a big deal. I've lived in Texas all my life, and the illegal alien thing hasn't been a big deal until the past couple of weeks when the media started blaring about it on TV. Unfortunately, I've noticed that the media affects public opinion here significantly, and why they chose to make it such a big deal is beyond my comprehension.
1984	Legally, yes, it can and has happened. The notorious urban legend of biker chicks having sex with a guy in a park is an example. The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they have little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. A guy weak enough to be "raped" would be a laughingstock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However, it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove it.
1985	I heard about it on the news this morning. IMO, he chose to do the action that resulted in the child. Even if she says she's on birth control, or he's using protection, it doesn't matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not doing it. So if he did the action and she got pregnant accidentally, he is as responsible as she is. On the other hand, if she got pregnant intentionally, and he knew she didn't want a child, then he might have a case, but it's probably difficult to prove. I agree that the child shouldn't be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.
1986	Thong-Wearing Men Arrested at Wal-Mart Thu Jul 29,10:59 AM ET AP SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. - Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "triple-dog dare," authorities said. The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, witnesses said. Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct.
1987	If you feel it's necessary, yes, but will you still be able to work and make your own money? These truck drivers have insurance, some of them have million dollar insurance, but not all of them go after the company that he drives for. He probably feels guilty about it every day of his life. I'm very sorry for your pain. Good luck.
1988	The press sells papers exaggerating the issues. Guantanamo's been a great example. The prisoners were humiliated, but they weren't tortured. The accusations are still coming up, however, and the UN is using that accusation to attack America.
1989	I'm moving to Singapore in a couple of months and discovered that they have a basically flat tax system on income, much lower than US, and heavy luxury tax on things like cars and brand name clothing. Many employees in my company are moving to various parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy, especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be driving out workers from some countries, which leads to tax loss. Places like Dubai and Singapore benefit greatly from tax problems faced by mature economies, multinationals have done this for years, individuals are starting to do it as well.
1990	In my opinion, the main problem is whether abortion is killing another human being or not. To solve this, we need to define what life means legally. I propose that life should be measured by brain activity, since it is the brain that makes us conscious. So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity, it isn't a living human yet, and can be legally aborted. This definition will circumvent both religious and ethical objections, potentially making the abort issue much easier to solve.
1991	I think that if a person is capable of committing suicide, they should be able to continue living. It's stupid to do that when you are willing to consider or even act on it. It doesn't make sense to choose suicide when you are capable of living.
1992	I don't think that students should be put in classes according to their ability levels. Instead of having someone fail a class, they could take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better chance of understanding what's going on. The students that are exceeding could be put in higher classes so they don't become bored with the curriculum. I don't mean that students should be put in different grades. I just feel that if they aren't particularly good in one subject, they may need to go to an easier class.
1993	I think the concepts of right and wrong are human created and subjective, that there are no objective morals and real 'good' and 'evil' do not exist. I am not advocating amorality, just saying that most acts we generally consider immoral are bad for society. Murder, theft, rape, etc. all of these things may not be intrinsically bad, but they are not beneficial to the person doing them or society in general. So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feelings, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.
1994	If something is important enough to be included on a web site, then it should be easy to find in the main body of content, and not buried in an FAQ section. I think people only turn to FAQ pages when they can't find what they want on the main site. If clients demand an FAQ page, I challenge them to think about what should be on the main copy, and what isn't. If the information is already in the main text, and they still want an FAQ section, they are just repeating the same information, which isn't necessary. Websites should never include an FAQ section, and I can't find an argument to support their use other than improving search engine rankings.
1995	I am very interested in the debate, I know that **censorship** is very related to my question, but I want to know why my opinion that using the word is wrong, and not how **implementing a censorship would work.**
1996	I've seen a lot of movies and it seems to me that when the movie ends, people in the audience clap. I don't understand it, because no one who worked on the movie can hear the clapping. I understand it when it's a special screening, or a premiere, or when there's an actor in the movie or a special guest in the audience, but under normal circumstances, it just doesn't make sense to me. Please change my mind, so I don't get annoyed when a theater full of people claps.
1997	Besides, anything "intrinsic" to a person has more to do with the environment that is out of their control than things they choose or even genetics. "Give me a child until they're 7 and I'll give you the man" The world is a big chaotic system where literally every single choice you make, even the unconscious ones, affect your destiny. So the choices you make as an adult are a result of how the world treats you as a child, and the seemingly insignificant, everyday choices we make have more to do with the butterfly effect than the ones that seem important anyway.
1998	Point 1: testing is the only reliable objective measurement and is necessary to assess whether the system is functioning properly. Point 2: Education changes over time and requires constant changes in curriculum and teaching methods to prepare students for life in the 21st century. Point 3: Teachers need to keep learning these new methods and changing curriculum in order to be effective leaders of learning. Point 4: Standardized testing before each school year would allow teachers to be moved where they are most effective or eliminated entirely if they are no longer effective at leading learning. Point 5: High performing teachers could be paid more if underperforming teachers were eliminated from the workforce.
1999	I'm not sure you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of planets with life. If we had two examples of the Milky Way galaxy, for instance, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxie, or if we had an example of the closest star with planets, we could conclude that probably all stars with planets evolve life. But with just one example, how can you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe? It could be once in a universe, once in a galaxy, or once in a hundred stars. It would look the same.
2000	* Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel in the last 2 weeks, despite Israel's numerous attempts to ceasefire without retaliation. * Hamas's refusal or ignorance of these opportunities of peace has left Israel with no choice but to respond to these events. * Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas, in order to safeguard its citizens, and not to hold it accountable for civilian deaths in Gaza when Hamas actively seeks to increase these losses by shooting missiles from civilian buildings. * I believe that Israel should be justified in invading Gaza and stopping further bombing.
2001	Since my apartment doesn't have an elevator, I keep my bike outside. About 3 weeks ago, my bike was stolen, I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen again. I can't spend over 80 euros on a new bike at the store, and I'm not buying a cheap one that was obviously stolen, either. The only option left is to start stealing bikes on my own. Why don't I do that? Please provide a better alternative.
2002	With the world coming close to annihilation due to leaders who are a bit trigger happy (the Cuban Missile crisis), I truly believe that nuclear weapons are the sole reason the world isn't in a major conflict right now. For example, the Cold War. If the U.S. and the Soviet Union didn't have their nuclear arsenal, what would Stalin, Khruschev, etc. have been to stop them from invading other European countries? They could have easily done so, and the U.S. couldn't have done anything to stop them. Our biggest and most terrifying weapons are our salvation, and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.
2003	I've seen a lot of criticism about burkas and other clothing that's meant to cover up Muslim women, but I haven't seen a lot of online discussions about burkas and other clothing that's meant to cover up Muslim women, but I haven't seen a lot of TV debates about burkas and other clothing that's meant to cover up Muslim women. But I don't think anyone realizes that the West does the same thing about breasts. In most places, women have to hide their breasts in public, websites consider that nudity and censor videos and images of them, and even if it's legal, people don't like it. We've sexualized our breasts, so we don't want them showing up in public, how is that different than stopping women from showing their faces or legs?
2004	I've heard throughout this debate that a team named Washington Redskins is the same as a team called Detroit N*****s. This is illogical, first of all, when has anyone ever heard the word "Redskin" other than in reference to a professional football team? Has anyone ever used the word "Redskin" in a hateful way? I don't know if it's a racial term, but I'll assume it is. However, using the word "Redskin" is not at all similar to using the n word, simply because of how it's used in context.
2005	People who don't know anything about it tend to have a bit of a contempt for it, they think it's some kind of hooliganism, it's linked to immaturity, it's got generally bad connotations if you ask the ordinary person. Some wouldn't even call it a sport. But I consider it an art form, because it's *fundamentally creative, everybody has their own style * a sort of artistic rebellion against the dull, boring cityscape that many people are born into, it takes what to someone else is just a ledge and turns it into something fun and creative. If you're more in favor of a corporation's right to take up public space with art than you are in favor of people's desire to rebel against that with street art, then fair enough. I don't expect to change your mind on this, and you won't change mine by saying it's against the law, but if you like street art, you should appreciate skateboarding on some level.
2006	I don't think that's a bad thing, but the way professional soccer players react when someone gets a slight bump isn't nice and it makes the sport look bad. I mean, obviously, that there are legitimate injuries, and that there should be punishment for fouls. I just say that soccer is full of fakers and that makes me mad.
2007	I'm not saying that wearing sexy clothes makes you less likely to get raped, but I think that wearing sexy clothes makes you more likely to get raped.
2008	I'm currently curious, and possibly wondering about perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am an American) considers bad, my thoughts tend to go to Putin, Osama Bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are bad, but I don't think that the people that we consider bad wake up every morning and say, "Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. Thanks
2009	Gravity's just a theory, so it shouldn't be taught at school because it's not absolute. A theory isn't a law, and kids shouldn't be learning speculative ideas about the world as facts.
2010	Quick summary; Religion, being based on zero evidence and abstract ideas attacks intelligence and mental development of human beings. From birth to adulthood, a person is capable of understanding the values Earth and Physics have to offer unless religion is introduced (parents, priest, churches, media, etc.) If easily convinced, this person is at high risk of losing the mental capacity of being'smart' in this sense.
2011	The US politicians have for too long ignored illegal immigration, which is raging in border states and stealing jobs from us. On top of that, our tax money goes to pay for their children's public education and medical care, which they don't pay into but steal from us. Their very status should say illegal, so we need states to be more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a change in citizenship so that "those who are born here = automatic citizens."
2012	The tennis scene is the funniest 15 seconds of any Wes movie, except Future Man's "you look like a banana" in Bottle Rocket.
2013	Marrying means everything is in place, stability for life, a partner who loves and adores you so much that they make a lifetime commitment to you, respect from family and friends, and most importantly HAPPINESS (otherwise, why get married in the first place?) Single life, in general speaking, is lonely, immaturity, selfishness, ignorance to making a true commitment, stuck in memory of the 8th grade class dance! While I understand completely it varies person to person, I believe there is more respect for a married couple who truly learn life's real beauties (trust, mutual respect, lifelong commitment to another human being)
2014	The shotgun would have to be loaded and fired, the chainsaw would have to be running continuously. If the zombie population on this street is dense, I'd choose the chainsaw and walk down the street turning in circles, though if there are only a few, the shotgun would have an advantage of range.
2015	To be fair, the belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction, which isn't pretty, but it's part of the deal. And while humans have a moral responsibility to moderate their impact on nature, we are doing more now than any species ever did before. Would it be "enough" to balance our impact, which isn't exactly "nature", or should we save every last species, however unsuitable?
2016	I guess it depends on the album you're listening to. But for the sake of argument, which is why we're here, I'll use the example of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.
2017	Every day, a democrat politician laments that we haven't captured or killed Osama Bin Laden. It would be a great achievement to capture or kill Bin Laden, but removing Bin Laden from the Earth would do little or nothing to stop terrorism. Terrorists, even Islamic terrorists in Indonesia, probably would not be impressed by the death of one man.
2018	I prefer PC gaming for FPS, RTS, MMORPG, and racing games, because I'm much more accurate with mouse and keyboard than with controller, and my PC's steering wheel and peripherals make my racing games much more fun than my controller. But for pretty much any other genre, console controllers are very helpful: side scrollers, action RPG, RPG, sports, etc.
2019	This is a cool debate. First of all, the death penalty is against the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. Second, retribution is another word for revenge. Third, the US executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders, but rather the ones with the least resources to defend themselves, demonstrating that the system is imbalanced. Fourth, once an inmate is executed, there is no way to make amends if there was a mistake. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged showing that mistakes had been made.
2020	The integration of Muslims into Britain is currently a problem. Christians and Muslims are using the debate to integrate more religious power into the country. This is why the Archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration.
2021	Cats are wonderful animals and pets. They're not always happy, like dogs, almost to the point where they're too dumb to realize the difference. "Cats make you work for affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do" Jack Burns from "Meet the Parents!" With cats, you don't have to clean up the yard, walk a dog and clean up their poop, no loud barks at night, no slobbering, no puppies urinating on the floor, etc. Cats are adorable creatures, dogs are... well, dogs!
2022	The failure of Operation Eagle Claw was not due to bad planning or incompetence of the military or Government, but because most of the choppers that tried to liberate the American hostages held in Iran, and not because of any incompetence or lack of military or Governmental planning.
2023	This is a very broad assertion, simply being a "dictator" is not a reason to get rid of, much less permanently eliminate, this so-called dictator. Who decides who is a dictator? If the world agrees that a nation's leader is a dictator, why assassinate him/her? There have been "beneficial" dictators, just as there have been bad non-dictators.
2024	I think 1984 is the best, in the sense that it's the most prophetic, which was, to some extent, Orwell's intention. It's, however, as all the best products in the world perfectly serve their purpose, which means that form follows function. I have to admit that I haven't read the other three books on the list, so I can only give you my opinion.
2025	You're right, the steel frameworks of no buildings ever burned to earth, must have been that really, really hot jet fuel, and the building next to the tower that went down, completely unrelated to the tower, must have collapsed on its own, I'm forgetting what I was saying, what did the Bush administration say again, because I'm sure that's what it said, right?
2026	I'm not saying we should destroy other languages, but it would be nice to have one official language that we use to communicate.
2027	We're against non-Christians here? People are voting against me opening a shop to serve all customers, Christian or not, who are deciding that they need something on Christmas Eve. In addition, anyone here ever forget a small thing when they're entertaining? Need batteries for a new electronic device? Want a pizza for guests? Christmas Eve catering? Of course the shops should be open.
2028	I found out about this place on Eater Montreal and it was busy at 1:45 pm on a Saturday. We had to wait about 25 minutes for a table for five people. The food is unique and not traditional, they have breakfast, lunch and a small brunch section. The food is very good, mixing interesting ingredients and textures and the taste and flavors are really good. We had Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna as my main dish. Both were excellent. The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it's spacious and the acoustics are good. I will definitely go back.
2029	This place is a neighborhood bar in a strip mall, which is basically in an alley. People bring their kids here, which makes it very noisy. The food is really good, though. The wings are really good, as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. The onion rings are really good, and they're crispy and battered and greasy, which is how onion rings should be. The ranch tastes homemade, which is really good. The staff is really nice, though.
2030	I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and loved Rudy's brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact they advertise themselves as "worst BBQ". I moved to Phoenix for 4 years and then back to Texas in 2010, this time to San Antonio. Yes, they have Rudy's there but they're not nearly as accessible as they are in Austin. I think I've been there once in 2 years. I went on a weekend trip to Phoenix at the end of July and surprise! A Rudy's! My friend had never been so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately, she didn't like the sauce but I loved every second. Not so much the brisket/egg taco but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. Oh, my! Now I'm moving back to CT so I'm sure Rudy's will be gone from my life but I'm glad I had one last taste. I'll miss you.
2031	I've been to this place twice and was very disappointed. I ordered 6 wings and fries and they came in a cardboard box. The meal was overpriced for the value. There's not a lot of room to sit inside. The owner seems to be a proudly conservative African American and doesn't hesitate to tell you that. I would suggest no African American support this restaurant. All skin folks aren't alike.
2032	Last night we had dinner at this wonderful restaurant and were seated on the lovely patio. The atmosphere was perfect for us to talk and enjoy the food. The staff was very attentive and professional. We had the Brussels sprout salad which was one of the best salads I've ever had, and the ribeye taco platter which was cooked to perfection and very flavorful. It was truly one of the best dinners I've had in a while. My husband and I actually split everything and it was just enough. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant.
2033	I'm only complaining about the loud rave music they play often during the daytime. The food is great, they have a great tea selection, and the staff is nice and helpful. I understand this is a bar at night, but this place is supposed to be a nice place for students to study during the day, so why play music that no one can concentrate on?
2034	Although the food is generally excellent and delicious, I cannot give it a 5. The biggest problem is that it's so hot in there, I was sweating buckets and I'm usually the one that's always cold. I've been here at least 4 times and the temperature hasn't changed. Also, the service is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes we get our food really fast and sometimes we get it really slow. Sometimes the app comes after our noodles have arrived which I don't mind that it comes after, but it's weird that gyoza takes that much longer than my noodles. All in all, still great food, but I really hope they fix the temperature soon!
2035	The school uniform is no match for special clothes in keeping a person warm or cool.
2036	Kids lose their individuality, which doesn't make them comfortable.
2037	Firefox respects W3C standards more, while soft sucks and wants us to use their own standards to maintain their monopoly.
2038	You're asked to confirm before the browser installs anything.
2039	No way, marriage is supposed to be a bond, partnership. Not that I'm calling anyone who'd turn his or her spouse into the police a "snitch" or a rat, but If my wife killed someone, I'd hesitate to use the 5th Amendment! Murder is a serious offence, but remember, when you say "I do", you're basically inviting the person you're marrying into your family. So ask yourself, would you turn in your family? If so, join the police force. If not, great, I would still divorce the crazy woman though!
2040	There's really no debate when it comes to those who actually read the book.
2041	Wow, Syona, your views are very impressive. Where did you get these unique data? I would kindly ask you to provide more details on all of this. Please, do not mind my words, but all of this special data is correct. Reply to me soon!
2042	I've got just one word to say: corruption. corruption. corruption.
2043	First kill all politicians, then India will develop tomorrow.
2044	India, where there's a class of oppressed people, huge wealth disparity, and a language that most people in the world can't or won't understand? Indian education isn't comparable to Western education, and the world's economy is controlled by superpowers. I highly doubt India will ever lead the world, and it doesn't even have the capacity to do so, and it should let it go to those powers.
2045	It's better to be without a father than a bad father, I say, because you'll have to deal with him and feel shame for yourself, and you'll have to live day by day knowing that he'll never be anything special, except for you, if you don't have a father.
2046	The treaty of Singapore is signed by Raffles, Sultan Hussein and Temenggong, with the commander of the Temenggong accompanying the event on seven ships.
2047	Sir Raffles is the legitimate founder because he increased Singapore's economy by using the Straits of Malacca for business, and thus many people came to Singapore for business, which boosted Singapore's economy.
2048	Raffles had been leading the expedition to find a new trade port, and Farquhar had only been a passenger on his ship.
2049	Without doubt Raffles' ambition and vision were the reason for him to look for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and for him to choose Singapore as the best place for British economic and strategic goals in the region.
2050	Raffles was responsible for Singapore's economic growth He increased Singapore's economy by using the Straits of Malacca for trade, and thus many people came to Singapore for business.
2051	God is abstract, He doesn't show himself very often. The idea of a god or gods is generally rather difficult to imagine. Apes are concrete, You can see them. The whole idea of an ape is fairly simple to grasp. It's funny that these supposed ancients, rather than believing in concrete, chose to believe in abstract concepts rather than concrete ones. If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say "God must have created me, I've seen Him around the garden" rather than "I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there"?
2052	In fact, creationism's an argument that has existed ever since history was written, and I think you're talking about a time when Christianity was just emerging from the Old Testament, so the Bible story is an argument that has existed for a lot longer than your notes
2053	It doesn't make your argument stronger just because you think your opponent is a bit manipulated.
2054	IE's a shit, stole the tabbed browsing idea from all other browsers, and you can't add extensions to it.
2055	I love these cute little pop-up windows, which Firefox doesn't have.
2056	Aye, of course. Besides health benefits, there's a greater respect for nature, sporting friendship, teamwork, reflexive situational calculations, just to name a few.
2057	Farquhar had been in charge of the new settlement when the British came, and had maintained it despite all odds, while Raffles had gone back to Bencoolen.
2058	William Farquhar had been reassigned by Raffles because he had become too close to the people. But knowing the people well was essential for Farquhar to be able to deal with the problems they were facing.
2059	Raffles neglected Singapore for about four years while he conquered other "more useful" countries, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. And, to prove my point, all the countries that Raffles had been running ended up badly, proving that he was a bad developer.
2060	William Farquhar had helped more Singaporeans than Raffles, who was more of an idea man.
2061	Pro-life means that the problem of overpopulation is directly caused, and many more children are born addicted to crack or impoverished.
2062	I'm not going to say I have an official position, but I need someone from the other side to explain this to me because I honestly don't know. If a 14 year old girl is raped, which happens, and then gets pregnant, but because she's 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro-life decision? Is it then pro-life to abort?
2063	Wouldn't that weaken your argument that I'm actually a brainwashed, doctrinated child?
2064	Why not both? Why didn't God create a way for evolution to occur? Who says he did this himself? Who says he didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution?
2065	Porn is entertainment, and it's not wrong or bad to use profanity in songs just because some people don't like it.
2066	I'm thinking about my parents, because they're doing their best to make me, my brother, my family and friends happy, and they're spending all their money and time on other people, instead of on themselves.
2067	In a perfect world, all people would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the betterment of mankind, but we do not live in a perfect world, nor will we ever.
2068	I'm saying the common good because of the kind of forces that can be made as a group, like the guy who says that if he doesn't vote, he doesn't make a difference, and when you see the population or the percentage, it's larger than the number of people who voted. So if you want the common good to prevail, you need more than just yourself to win, by finding people who share your views.
2069	I think school uniforms are a great idea, because students don't have to spend so much time choosing and buying school clothes, especially girls, so they can spend more time studying.
2070	I'm sure they're good, because this way all the girls out there won't taunt each other over fashion, and it will make all students feel and look the same, which will make them pay more attention to their studies, because they won't have to worry about whether they have the most expensive clothes at school, or whether they look the best, or whether they look the best, or whether they look the best, or whatever.
2071	Dads can be terrible sometimes, but they're supposed to be the icons that inspire us to go beyond them. You can't have a healthy family without two parents guiding your life, no matter what. Dads are the people you look up to most, no matter how high you grow.
2072	These arguments aren't true, and your team looks like a bunch of crazy fools.
2073	Profits HA, you're looking for cash, or are you going to live longer without water, have fun with that.
2074	TV is better than books, because TV has more convenient and simpler learning programs, and it's better for people who can't see or hear. Books also may not have the most recent information on a given topic, while TV information can be much more precise and helpful.
2075	Televisions use electricity, books like Harry Potter are made from trees, so they're bad for the environment.
2076	The United States spends billions of dollars a year on bottled water, and banning it would significantly harm an already struggling economy. The plastic used to make the bottles, as well as the advertising on the bottles and packaging, is also a significant part of the business. Additionally, compostable water bottles are emerging on the market, which can be used instead of plastics to avoid this negative effect. Furthermore, bottled water is safer than city water, and it is easier to trace when a potential health risk occurs.
2077	The United States alone grew by over 13%. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation's research and consulting, the global bottled water industry exploded to over $35 billion in 2002. Americans alone spent $7.7 billion on bottled water in 2001.
2078	We know that freshness and consistency go together, so we use a sophisticated, multi-barrier filtration system that uses carefully controlled and constantly monitored disinfection processes in sanitary lines. We test the water for purity when it arrives at our plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. We test for more than 200 potential contaminants per year, far more than state and federal regulations require.-nuff said http://delivery.polandspring.com/Delivery/home/help/OurWater.aspx
2079	It's not possible to marry a gay man, let alone legally, but there are no religious requirements or strict religious guidance. Marriage is defined as a union between a woman and a man, so the term "marriage" can be misused in this instance. Civil unions, that's another matter entirely.
2080	I'm voting "No," because it's against human nature, and as other voters have pointed out, against the definition of "marriage." And this argument cannot be left out of the religious one, because this is what happens when people don't have faith or trust in any religion. Religion is a guide, and without it, we're lost.
2081	Is incestual marriage good or bad? Does incestual homosexual marriage include incestual marriage? Which country legalized incestual marriage, which led to lower marriage rates?
2082	I respect other opinions, but this is unnatural and against my moral standards.
2083	I'm a Christian, and the Bible plainly states homosexuality is bad. Call me pathetic, weak, whatever you want, but I'm sure the Bible is the truth, the whole truth, and the only truth.
2084	India's a wonderful place to live, its various cultures mix together in one.
2085	I'm Indian, and I'm not going to show my country's weakness, and the guy who believes that only through discussion can solve all problems, is wrong, because he also knows how his country is.
2086	India is capable of leading the world, but so is China! America is still outsourcing good manufacturing jobs to these countries, which boosts India and China's economy!
2087	Atheism's a good guy, he's making my logic work and he's not scared of anything.
2088	The idea that there is a gods is stupid and illiterate. All other arguments are completely devoid of meaning.
2089	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but only as a last resort.
2090	Yes, because sometimes discipline isn't working, so they need a little spanking to realize they're wrong. Don't just spank them for no reason, that's bad.
2091	I'm of the opinion that children should be spanked once in a while, and when I was young, I was spanked, and I definitely learned my lesson. Don't just spank your kids with whatever you have, you don't wanna kill them!
2092	Because depending on the penalty you're giving the kid, it doesn't always work, some kids really need that, because just sitting on the penalty is a possibility for them to do it again.
2093	It's definitely Christianity, and I'm lucky to be at a Christian school where I learn more about our awesome God!
2094	In my convictions, I've gained more peace, and I will continue to look for the Lord until the end of my life.
2095	No, because they're barely growing up, and still trying to understand the world.
2096	No, because spanking can affect the relationship between a child and his parents, and children can sense when their parents are angry and behave violently. There are better ways to deal with this problem, such as using other techniques.
2097	The kid's young,he doesn't know what's bad and what's right.
2098	I'm not sure anybody wants to be spanked by their parents, so spanking shouldn't be an option.
2099	Physical violence against a child is a cause of fear for parents and may lead to a stutter.
2100	My point is, I wouldn't want to live with a woman who might be schizophrenic under one roof.
2101	If a woman is raped and has a child, she should put it up for adoption. If someone murders a pregnant woman, they are charged with murdering both the woman and the child. People have this stupid excuse that it's not a child, it's a fetus. If you look it up in the dictionary, it says fetus is a word that means unborn child.
2102	In addition, you may want to refresh your etymology and use more diverse sources, rather than simply paraphrasing definitions that suit your point of view.
2103	No way! There's so many fat kids at my school, and two periods of PE a week and after school sports haven't changed them a bit.
2104	It's not a bad thing to be gay, it's just a lifestyle choice. It's not a "natural" choice, it's a choice between a man and woman of love. Love is all some people have, you can't just take it away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want to be accepted and understood, let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't want to be gay either. Who would choose to live like that? They are constantly harassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please respect them. They haven't done anything wrong, God created them that way.
2105	No one told you you must read, vote, or leave a comment. I'm always amazed at people who take the time to write a comment saying they don't care, and that we should stop talking about it. And another thing: people who write comments like mine make me sick.
2106	I'd like to start by saying that marriage is a ridiculous institution and should not exist, but that's another matter entirely. For me, who wants to get married is completely irrelevant.
2107	In my personal opinion, if you improve yourself, you can improve the world. You have to focus on yourself first, before you can deal with the problems of the world and try to solve them, or you'll break down.
2108	I'd be lying to myself if I said advancing the common good was more important than personal goals.
2109	I think personal goals are better, because you can't help people around you when you can't help yourself. Personal goals aren't always about money, but they can be about happiness, love, and success.
2110	We should keep our jobs at home; pay our workers decent wages that are in line with living costs, which wouldn't be nearly as high if we'd kept our jobs at home all along. We should also stop voting for self-adjustments for our political leaders; stop trying to be world peacemakers and money controllers, by both providing and then forgiving debt, only to "loan" more; and realize that the world has the same abilities and resources we did, they just need to choose to use what they have and develop a work ethic and put it into practice.
2111	The Americans have been relentlessly pursuing Saddam, and they'll definitely convince the tribunal to sentence him to capital punishment. But you mustn't forget, that even today, Saddam is feared and respected by many in Iraq. The outcome won't be decided so swiftly. Have you seen the glaring eyes and stance when he recently told the judge, "I am the ruler of Iraq, and who are you, a foreigner trying to judge me?" The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly related to Saddam's case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts? No. The chair will probably decay &break, the switches & wires will rust or melt away. And don't suggest a rope, because there isn't such a strong rope in the world to break such a strong throat.
2112	It is technically legal to make these cartoons, but it was reckless. The cartoonist must have known that they would provoke trouble in extremist countries. But I think the Islamic world is overreacting, destroying credibility and making itself appear as a bunch of hysterical little kids who riot at the slightest insult. Do you know how many websites are dedicated to mocking Jesus Christ? Do you know how many Christians burn down embassies over such things?
2113	If you're fired, your employer must pay you the wages you're owed plus any other remuneration (vacation pay, etc.), immediately. As a manager, you're accountable for your subordinates and the money. Your employer needs to prove you took the money, but you might be able to get your job back-talk to the state or federal Department of Labor. You could possibly sue for Wrongful Termination if your employer cannot prove you took the money.
2114	No thing is bad or good in itself, it's how it's used, implemented, and taken up that makes it bad or good. In India, reservation has been and is used to please certain people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in the constitution which were originally for 15 years or Mandal commission implementation after years of lying in the bag. There are many aspects of reservation, there are certain sections of society that need support to get out of their current status of poverty or backwardness. However, there is opposition to reservation because the benefits of reservation are not going to actual people, rather they are taken up by some people in these societies who are already in the upper class and are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy person gets the benefit, you and all are angry since it's someone who isn't really needy who is getting the benefit.
2115	You can't evict him, you can't complain to the authorities, there's no way to solve this.
2116	I'd contact the cops and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal, I assume, they wouldn't be interested in this, but the threat is real.
2117	You can't sue your employer for a condition that you might have been predisposed to develop due to your poor health, your eating habits, or your simply bad habits. Removing your pituitary gland won't cause you to develop diabetes. You probably already had diabetes, but you didn't know it until they performed the surgery to remove your pituitary gland. I'm sorry, but your employer is only responsible for the damage you suffered while you were at work, and if you quit your job, your next job should have provided you with health insurance.
2118	I've missed a few changes in the last few months, so I know how unpopular this is. Kids are growing up faster, maybe on the outside, but in the emotional world they grow at their own pace. Maybe with all these distractions, kids need more time to recover from the quiet time they've lost.
2119	I'm not finding any ethical justification for his actions, which is the same as Hitler did, and this isn't a fictitious situation, is it? You just need some ammunition, and you won't get it here! And there's no ethicality in blowing up Japan, Truman was made to believe they were military targets, when in fact, most of them were women and children. There wasn't any military target in sight! And we didn't have to blow up two cities!
2120	I'm sorry, but I don't think there'll be any laws to protect whites. I don't think there's any need for laws like that, if you can do your job and do it well, I don't think it should matter what color you are, whether you're male or female, just do your job and get paid.
2121	It's just like paying for haircuts, legal services, tax services, and doctor's visits. There are costs associated with providing a service, including salaries. Because schools are businesses, they provide services to you (the client), and in return, you (the client) pay money to cover the costs of that service, because you (the client) are the one benefiting from the education. Chin up. Unless you're attending a private college that doesn't accept government funding, the amount you pay for education is about half the total cost of your education. Alumni associations and taxpayers (who don't directly benefit from your education) foot the rest.
2122	The idea of freedom of speech is that you can say whatever you like, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. You can't shout fire in a crowded cinema, but you can criticize your government or any group. The problem is that people don't stop at just talking.
2123	There's no law that says managers have to keep pizzas in reserve for you to deliver, in fact, that's against the laws of customer service, as long as no one's injured.
2124	It is ridiculous that some Muslim leaders are even demanding a separatist state within the borders of traditional European countries where generosity and guest treatment are so horribly abused by some Muslim.
2125	First of all, incest isn't always "child abuse." Sex between closely related consenting adults is probably going to happen. The United States isn't known for incest, but there's a stereotype that it happens in the South. It's not. The highest rates of incest in the U.S. are among hispanics. Incest is widespread in Central and South America.
2126	Brian Doyle has not only gotten what he deserves, but he should have gotten it the last time he did it. Without law enforcement being able to improvise, criminals would run amok in this country.
2127	No, I'm not, but it seems to me that she could benefit from some legal assistance at a pro bono basis, or at a low income legal services. You'd be surprised at how much some places consider low income. My sister's husband earns $400.00 a week in winter and $60.00 a week in summer, and they have three people in their household. They make around $46,000 a year and they get help from WIC, Daycare Assist, food assistance. So tell her, or help her to find these services.
2128	It's the first step on a slippery slope to a total nanny state. Obviously, it's better to wear a seatbelt, exercise 5 times a week, eat well, chew your food 15 times before swallowing it, look both ways when crossing the street, and don't run with scissors.
2129	I agree. It's not rational to punish the lazy and allow the wife beaters to get away with it. Throw the potheads in jail?
2130	I am not sure if this is relevant to your class, but this is my personal opinion...Historically, when human rights were defined, women were not included. For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized..
2131	I think we're already living in the misogynistic world you describe: in the U.S., a woman gets 75 cents for every dollar a man gets for the same work, 70% of the world's 1.3 billion people live in poverty, two-thirds of all children who don't get basic education, 75% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults, women work two-thirds of the world's working hours, produce half the world's food, make 10% of the world's income, own less than 1% of the world's property. tell me exactly how we're so balanced, why anyone would not be a feminist.
2132	This is dishonest, and it's stealing. If you pay to see one movie, and then sneak into another, you're cheating the theater of ticket sales. You might also affect the box office receipts for the movie you saw, but didn't pay for. People do this all the time, and they get away with it, but it's still wrong.
2133	The issue here isn't whether they can kill people, it's why they should. The execution of a known criminal who has committed a number of crimes which would have resulted in the death of many people would have forfeited his right to life under the eyes of the law. If he had been released and thus caused more deaths in the population, it would have been justified. They are against violence, which is, unjustified and senseless violence. Sanctioned killings whereby a person commits crimes which are considered unjustified in the eyes of the community are not a crime or hypocrisy but are justified and necessary. As for war, it depends on the reason. For the defense of life and country it is a noble cause, for an outsider of a regime not friendly to a country that is selfcentered hyprocracy for a nation that cherishes life, liberty and happiness.
2134	It's his legal responsibility to prescribe the medication, but he might not even have access to your medical records. Federal law guarantees you access to your medical records, and the facility owner is responsible for their maintenance.
2135	I think that the mother should have the right to be uncontacted, but in case of a medical emergency, she should have the contact of an intermediary. Women need that security, so that they do not feel pressured by the condemning spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It is very unfortunate that abortion is often chosen for these reasons.
2136	I'm opposed to that, because I started my life with nothing, grew up on the projects, and now I've made a bit of a fortune. I don't owe anybody anything. I'll walk away from anybody who wants to take my hard work away! My brother and I were the only white kids on the projects, that's an unfair situation! Don't you think it's time you cried for recompense to somebody else?
2137	The plate with the red letters won't be accepted, because there are people in high positions who have been busted for drunk driving, and they don't want to be seen with a plate with the red letters on it.
2138	Many wish he'd do it, but reality is, there would be a big uproar. American public would suffer, especially working class and lower class earners. The woes would be unbearable! The US economy would be adversely affected or even lowered. The fact is, Bush uses the "Born Again Church" to his advantage. Is he Christian? Very questionable, no signs. Hah! He's just as much a Christian as Bin Laden is.
2139	The fact that a person is born with a condition that makes them less than others is not a reason to treat them any differently than other people. The fact that they are physically or mentally impaired, whether their ancestry is European, African, Asian, or Native American, is not a reason to treat them any differently than other people. Everyone has a right to be treated equally in their society, community, and nation.
2140	I think we're becoming a communist country when we try to pass such a law, what does this country think it is, telling people how much they can spend on food, or not, is it helping our economy? There's more to obesity than just buying too much food, some people who are obese don't eat much, but what they eat is junk and empty calories, some try to buy healthy, and stuff like Slim Fast full of preservatives and poisons, some just don't exercise. Perhaps we should pass a law mandating exercise, or health and nutrition classes, maybe we should stop selling junk food, maybe we should make organic and natural foods more accessible.
2141	You've got a baby with this person, and unless you can prove that he's not a good parent, or is committing crimes, or is otherwise unsuitable for parenting, then you must share parenting time with him. In fact, he deserves to have parenting time and influence over the course of his baby's life.
2142	It's going to cost you between $30,000 and $50,000 to hire a private lawyer for murder, so if you don't have that much cash, you might as well just stick with the public defender.
2143	You are correct in asking your question. Unless you are served with court documents, your husband may still be divorced somewhere else. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce lawyer or private investigator may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want a divorce, your best bet is to initiate the divorce yourself. Your lawyer can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be divorced.
2144	First of all, what your stepson is doing is libel, because it's written, slander is oral, which he might also do, but since he's sending letters, it's libel. If you're serious about stopping him, start with the police. Libel laws vary from state to state, and they'll be able to tell you that. If it's civil, talk to a lawyer about bringing a lawsuit against your stepson and what the reasonable expectation of outcome might be, for example, if your stepson doesn't have any assets to lose, etc.
2145	If life was fair, innocent people wouldn't go to jail, hard workers would make a living, decent people wouldn't be poor.
2146	I'm tired of defending Obama to my conservative friends for 6 years while he: kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, GOP alternative to single payer, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood up to NSA, etc., etc. Hillary Clinton will probably win the Democratic primary, and probably be the next president, and if anything she will be even less progressive than Obama has been. Please, change my mind before I turn into a 25 year old husk of a man.
2147	I love bulldogs, pugs, and dogs in general. However, due to designer breeding, these short nosed dogs have terrible breathing problems, a host of other health problems are expected. Every bubble of air is a struggle, which is probably why they sleep so much, and probably is a cause of several of those health problems. I suppose there is an optional surgery to increase airflow, but the vast majority of owners don't choose to do it. It breaks my heart to see these amazing dogs gasping for air, I can imagine all the health problems I'd have if I had to struggle with every breath. If I am wrong, please help me, I would love to own a beautiful bully but I'd feel terrible for all these reasons.
2148	From my own experience as an engineering student in my final year, I've come to realise that universities aren't here to serve humanity and all love science or whatever subject they study, they're here to serve the corporate world.
2149	We watched a CNN special at school on genocides after the Holocene, and the piece believes the U.S. should have done something about it. I don't think the U.S. should have done anything. I don't think it's its responsibility to help anybody. I think this kind of thing puts the U.S. in a bad position. If we don't do anything, people will see us as irresponsible, because we're a superpower, but if we do, people will see us as oil-seeking imperialists. So I don't think the U.S. should be fighting other people's battles. In all of these cases of genocide, I think it's their fault to sort them out.
2150	This may vary somewhat from place to place, but in my country (UK), I see people complaining about the cost of healthy food, then walking past a £1/1kg bag of carrots, which would last several meals as an add-on, 80p/lb of celery, £1/1kg bag of oatmeal, 75p/lb of bananas... several kilos of food for under £4. If you've got a big enough freezer, you can buy chicken breasts in bulk for months, which would cost 48 pounds (10kg in my country), then buy ready meals for £2 each, or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (which is fine for a special occasion, but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain about the cost of healthy food).
2151	I think that sports in general are a huge drain on time, energy and money, diverting attention away from the things in our society that really need it.
2152	Most people, most of the time, rather than form an unbiased opinion (if there even is one), about a certain issue, they simply form their position due to emotional reasons. A gut feeling, if you will.
2153	I've been talking to my parents, who are both very religious, and I've come to realise that while religion contributes to wars, its biggest problem is that it prevents the spread of scientific progress, particularly in medicine, climatology, and biology, which are concerned with the problems of climate change and evolution, and society, specifically as regards same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, etc.
2154	I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basic idea of capitalism is that the hard workers get a decent life, and the less well off get a relatively less decent life. Sometimes, the less well off have to work extremely hard just to make ends meet. In socialism, everyone gets a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism, where there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend, but the poor are uplifted, and the rich are taxed. Capitalists argue that socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism?
2155	I've been fishing last weekend with a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released about 10 to 15 fish. We caught a lot of baitfish, which were alive, and then we threw a hook through their still living bodies, and then we threw them back into the water. I can't think of any reason to justify this behavior as moral. The baitfish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we threw a hook through their faces, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish, and the suffering only ended when they were eaten. At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through their faces, fought for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook, and started over. I didn't like it. But, fishermen, do you change my mind?
2156	I think the Tories are all selfish money-grabbing bastards who care nothing about anyone except themselves. Gove was a complete disaster in education, and now we have this woman who was previously Minister for Women and Equalities, but who also voted against gay marriage, and who supports a number of measures which will only serve to enrich the country's wealthy and famous (such as academies and higher education), and I doubt that anything will change from Gove's terror reign, or perhaps even worsen.
2157	I do not think that there are natural rights, that is to say: *"...things which are not dependent on the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable..."*. I think all rights granted to any human are social constructs, created by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth. To clarify, I am defining "right" as a guarantee of access to a commodity or state of being, without necessarily referring to a legal structure. Please, CMV!
2158	I've always thought of someone recording a video with their phone vertically as a mouthbreather. It's a small thing, but it bothers me that people don't think about how the video will look when it's played later on YouTube or Facebook or whatever. Many times people end up covering 2/3 of the screen with black bars, or even stretching &amp; blurring the sides. These videos **always** look terrible. The only reason I can think of is if the person recording only intends to watch it on the same device. But then again, why would you want a video that's only intended to be watched on a phone?
2159	I've learned after doing my research and talking to friends and family that this issue is very important to parents. In my opinion, parents should decide whether or not children are vaccinated. Some people do not get vaccinated and live long, healthy lives, others do and the same thing happens. I think this is due to biology. Of course vaccinated people get sick, but so do not vaccinated people. My conclusion is that people should not be forced to vaccinate their children if they do not wish to. They should be informed about the benefits and drawbacks of their decision, make an informed decision, and be satisfied.
2160	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and have not found any resemblance to a "center of consciousness" in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. This raises the question: external or internal source of consciousness? We could be just as easily a host for consciousness that has an external source, as we are just a random chemical self-awareness. Just because fiddling with the brain fiddles with perception does not mean that our consciousness is sourced in the brain, for the same reason that breaking your speakers does not mean the livestream you're watching went silent.
2161	I'm reminded of why I don't like football (football). I don't mean that I don't like other team sports, because I think football (football) is one of the most beautiful dramatic sports in the world. Yes, there are documented cases of corruption in other "major" team sports, but the level of corruption in Football (football) is on another level entirely. Oscar-worthy failures, blown calls, reluctance to use technology, documented match fixing, officials taking advantage of it, FIFA's stealing of host nations, rampant racism, blah, blah, blah, all evidence pointing to Football (football) being, at best, a WWE of world sports, and at worst, the most corrupt organized team sports.
2162	He's going to continue moving Jews to Madagascar, or he's not doing anything to them at all. He's going to conquer more land than Napoleon or Rome, and in less time. He's going to bring great empires like Russia, France, United Kingdom almost to their knees, which is something Germans of the previous generation wanted to do during World War I. He's going to make Germany rise from the ashes as phoenix, and he's going to make vengeance on Versailles, and he's going to make the Autobahn, which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I think Germans would be much more proud of their history if it hadn't been for the horrors of genocide.
2163	I'm wondering if anyone here has been surprised by a military family member coming home?
2164	I've often read people talking about the idea of natural rights, which are universal and inalienable. In my opinion, these are simply constructs, which do not have any basis other than any other constructs humanity has created. While there may be some appeal to human nature, nearly all universal behaviour that could be classified as rights only apply to the "in-group", and certainly none seem to apply to humanity as a whole. Extending rights to cover everyone is a construct, and not part of fundamental human nature. This is why law exists in general. It's an extension of tribal self-rule for larger groups. There is certainly nothing about the nature of reality that causes rights to exist. I'd like to hear some good arguments as to why rights are not constructs.
2165	I know this has been asked before but I'd like to get some fresh thoughts. So, the US has the biggest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). The US donates more money to charity/aid organisations than any other country. The US is the entertainment capital of the world (I realize that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying over all: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games). The US has most of the greatest universities in the world. I understand that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, etc. ad infinitum). But that being said, for the US not to be the best country, another country has to be declared the best. So who is it? The UK? China? Make your case.
2166	Neither of these Italian crooners were, despite their success, really gifted singers IMO. Between the two, Dino had a better voice, a wider range and a better tambour, his early inspirations, his model singers when he was an aspiring singer were more blues and jazz based, Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing far better than Martin. Frank also had better material, especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither are jazz singers, The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs were recorded extensively by jazz musicians yet rarely have any of Dino's songs had that.
2167	First of all, I am amazed that they haven't permanently put duct tape over Biden's mouth. The stupid things that this guy says. Second, this package is a terrible idea. Yay for Barry-O and his lovely, lovely administration.
2168	We're not impeaching GW, so why are we impeaching Clinton? He did nothing but polish his knob, GW got us into trillions of debt, started wars that cost thousands of lives, ruined our good name worldwide. What Clinton did was between him and Hill, nothing worse than any of the great presidents.
2169	We're just people, at the end of the day, and if someone likes same-sex relationships, that's their problem. I don't think that's a big deal. They should be happy and not live a lie! You can argue that God created man and woman, but I don't think that God wants you to be unhappy.
2170	PCs are less expensive, and have more powerful hardware, Macs use generic hardware, not specific Apple hardware, which is often believed. People also believe that Macs are less likely to break or need to be replaced less frequently than PCs. If you ever work in a place, like I did, where Macs are networked together and used as the main computer, you'll see that Macs are just as susceptible to problems as PCs. In fact, we bought some Pro machines that had 100% failure rate over the course of 3 or 4 years of use.
2171	The Lion King has more Oscar nominations than Aladdin, so there's that!
2172	Aye, that's true. Debates about religion don't really change anything. Instead, insults are thrown, and sides are seriously ganged up on, and people are seriously belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody's going to change their beliefs because someone points out scientific or Bible "evidence" that might or might not be real, and isn't as solid as it seems. Furthermore, speaking for both sides, both have faults and apparent weaknesses, and there are apparently oppenings that aren't explained, so each side just picks each other apart as much as they can.
2173	California is the best! - State of opportunities - If it was a country, it would have the 10th biggest economy on earth (CIA estimated). - Doesn't have the same kind of hate and racism you'd find in other states. - Has some of the most amazing natural landscapes and sights on earth. - Technology birthplace and new frontier for modern world. - Nice weather.
2174	It's ZED people! When you talk on the phone and you have to spell something that starts with ZED, it's like day and night when you say ZED. When you talk to Yankees and have to pronounce ZEE, there's all these "did you say V or D?" and all sorts of questions about whether or not you said ZED. Let's change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
2175	This is a case of comparing Israel and America's unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. We've helped Israel turn into a nation that relies on terror and violence against opponents rather than balancing power and diplomacy. You can bet that America's government will blindly support Israel if it decides to attack Iran unfairly. This should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.
2176	That's pretty much what the young listen to, or what MTV or Z100 play, the current trendiest rap music, full of constant references to money, cars, etc., and fake gangster nonsense. They're so stupid, they have those horrible songs that come wrapped up in some stupid dance, like that little dumbass solja boy. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
2177	Suicide, especially among young people, is not only draining the country's resources, such as education and so on, but also means that the person will not be able to make any contribution to society.
2178	We're constantly seeing different colors, most of which are just shades of other colors.
2179	This week, the world's corporate headquarters churned out the worst results since the 1990s recession, and some companies started a round of massive layoffs, which together with the continuing fall of stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.
2180	I'm not sure changing the motto would be beneficial economically, but your argument is complex and difficult to address. You manage to connect the motto to both Islamic militants and America's moral bankruptcy.
2181	Agents. This is an agency. This is a cliche. Even though management is creating the "strategic plan", if it's not in the best interest of Agents, then management is useless, they must devise another plan... Until the "power" kicks in, Agents will only be able to follow.
2182	If you're promoting your religion as absolute truth, you need evidence to back up your claim. If you're refusing to provide that evidence, you're denying your fellow man the ability to find out the truth, and quite frankly, if he or she were to die at that point and be condemned to eternal damnation, isn't their blood on your hands? You had the means to save them but didn't.
2183	Evolution is backed by science, including DNA tracing, and archaaeological findings such as Lucy. Evolution simply states that species can evolve to adapt to their surroundings. Humans probably evolved from apes, because their DNA is very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns, such as using tools to find food. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when absolutely everything is discovered about it. Gravity is only a scientific theory, as is the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory, it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof. Therefore, we can say that evolution is a more plausible theory than creationism.
2184	We had a great experience here! My date had prime Rib and I had a burger with three different types of meat in it. My date loved the prime Rib and her mashed potatoes and my burger was cooked perfectly. In fact, the burger was incredible, just writing this review makes me want to go get another one now. The only downside I would have to say was the Mac and Cheeze. I did speak with the manager and he said that it was a new item and they are working on it. We will definitely be back!
2185	The place is very cozy, almost as if you're in a wooden cabin, which fits perfectly with the Canadian theme of "comfort food." I've had some dishes here, like lobster roll, PEI mussels, and boneless back rib burger, all of which I would recommend. Unfortunately, the daily noodles are not available on all three visits, so I'll have to try them another time.
2186	We went there on Monday night and there were several servers there, but they didn't take our drink order for 15 minutes, so we left. The manager asked how we were doing when he walked by, but he didn't ask any more questions. Why ask how I was doing when you clearly don't care or want to know the reason, which is evidenced by your pace around the restaurant.
2187	The food was really good and our server Samantha was very kind. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us to chase her. Also, I think Samantha took an extra $3 off the bill because she was charged $47 and change and I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have gone back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt so there was no way to prove it.
2188	I had two curries and pad Thai and all were very good, but the reason I gave it five stars is because the waiter was kind enough to take the spice level down from what my girlfriend requested (which she ate quite a bit of) and then brought back a new curry and rice that had less spice. And we got free ice cream!
2189	I had a really bad experience here. The place wasn't busy, but everything was just so slow. I think the staff was working too hard. The food wasn't very good when I got home 1 hour later. Don't order the mushroom stroganoff. It was inedible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms were too hard to chew. We had 12 people in our group on the patio and it wasn't very fun.
2190	I was very disappointed in the food portions for the price point, or maybe I'm just bitter that this place took over Messinis. I gave 1 star because I had high expectations = fail, it had big shoes to fill (messinis) = fail, food portions for the price point = fail, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good, but it better be if it costs $7. I will always try a new place once. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place or go back again.
