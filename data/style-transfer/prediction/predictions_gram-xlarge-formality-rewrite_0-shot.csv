0	Students should feel free to wear what they like.
1	People should not be forced to wear school uniforms. Each person has a choice of whether or not to wear school uniforms. I think principals should reconsider.
2	That style of argument degrades this forum and will cause the arguments to fall to the lowest common denominator. The word "indisputable", I do not think it means what you think it means. I disagree with your claim from personal experience, if nothing else, that makes it disputable. I think Yahoo! has chat rooms more attuned to your style of debate. Check them out.
3	I would not turn her in because she is my wife. She made a mistake, but we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what she did, then I could not do that to her.
4	I would not turn in my spouse. Just because my wife killed someone does not mean she is a terrible person.
5	I would choose books based on that, as television is terrible.
6	I love books and getting lost in them. They also improve your literature, so my English teacher said.
7	Reading a book allows you to save money because you do not need to buy any reading devices or use electricity.
8	I think that books are better than TV because they put you in a whole North World, and they are educational.
9	Books are enlightening. Books do not destroy children's morals. Books challenge the mind. Books take the reader to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. Books change the perspective of life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug.
10	India has strong military neighbors (China & Pakistan)...India has a bad relation with Pakistan due to territorial disputes and has fought four wars for this. As far as China is concerned, India's relationship with China has become tense due to the rise of territorial disputes and Indian interference in Pakistan. As for Pakistan, China has long term plans such as the Pak-China Economic Corridor and Gawadar Mega Oil City.
11	India is a horrible country.
12	India is a good adopter but a bad developer. The leader should be a great developer.
13	Russell Peters is very good at making fun of people.
14	According to a recent report 50% of scientists in NASA are Indian IITians. If those scientists joined ISRO, then our status, value, and astronomical knowledge of India would definitely increase. Now, think about IITians and students who are completing IIT. They are known to be superbrain. If India is capable of opening hitech institutions, then why are we unable to provide them a perfect job of their level? We are giving international status of education. Then why are we unable to take best advantages from them? This is due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, suitable working environment as well as proper salary. So, it is the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
15	I would rather be completely fatherless. I am not saying that not having a father is better than having a bad one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take me for example. I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction. Those were the essential times a kid needs to be around his father. I turned out great. So yes, as opposed to having a bad father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would rather be completely fatherless.
16	Although being fatherless is a horrible thing to deal with, I would rather be fatherless than have to deal with someone who constantly annoys me.
17	Raffles was followed by Farquhar when he visited Singapore, proving that he was the founder.
18	Raffles had written his discovery incorrectly as 29 February 1819. It was later corrected. He thought he had discovered Singapore on his first journey.
19	Without Raffles' vision and ambition, Singapore may have remained a sparsely inhabited island in the East Indies.
20	Raffles established a local magistrate in Singapore. This magistrate led to activities such as public gambling and slavery being controlled. Farquar protected Singapore from the Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
21	That is interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. I haven't noticed mankind changing form for a few thousand years. Another question- With this whole "big bang" theory, it seems like everything should have blown apart in a big bang and not come together.
22	As a nurse, I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Each cell is more complex than a computer. Do you question the existence of a creator, or do you require evidence that this highly organized machine was brought into existence by an accident or order of circumstances?
23	Although I voted for evolution, creation is more easily accepted due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.
24	Believing in evolution as in Darwinism is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring out the pieces.
25	Firefox, and its extensions, consume large amounts of memory. For example, a session with three tabs and one week uses 250 MB of memory.
26	Physical education should be compulsory because it keeps us fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit when you are an adult, but when you are a child the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy, then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Additionally, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.
27	In my opinion, a founder would be a leader who is well respected by the organization or group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times he left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, he was a more competent leader.
28	The only other choices are adoption or keeping it. I know many children are adopted, but many are not. It might be better to just have an abortion to let them suffer. That is the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to decide one woman's pregnancy?
29	Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Should we not simply let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
30	In fact, we are evolving. Research this: every generation, our small toe is becoming increasingly smaller. Eventually, we will end up losing it. I know it is a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage, but evolution is at work.
31	I understand that people have religious beliefs, and that's fine; I think people should be able to do what they want without being judged for every move they make. However, evolution has been scientifically proven to be correct. What is your point?
32	The answer is not because we are descended from monkeys, but because they are incapable of speech.
33	Pornography is not wrong. If it was, then it should be illegal. It provides the "erotic" needs of people who do not have a partner.
34	Pornography is not inherently wrong, because it can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice.
35	I think that they are all virgins or still live with their mothers and cannot watch pornography.
36	It is not wrong, and if you are talking about the actors doing the scene, it is their choice. They like doing it, and it is not degrading to women. We have freedom of expression, and it helps some of us to be open about sex.
37	There was a rapper who said he was the people's champ. When wanting to be successful, sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that is what people want. Personally, I believe advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when you are always thinking about yourself and your personal pursuits, you tend to become conceited and become a jerk. A jerk is someone who is not liked, and when alone and not liked by others, becomes lonely.
38	I believe there are different ways to feel happy and proud of what you do. For example, I feel happy helping others, but that does not mean I help every person in front of me. I try to do what I think is best and good in order to make somebody happy.
39	I believe common good is more important than personal pursuits because it is better to help other people. I feel good when I help people because it makes me feel happy that I am doing something good in my life.
40	This is a good thing, it shows that the school and everyone else accepts each other no matter where they come from, who they are, or what their religion is.
41	Wearing school uniforms makes you sure that you go to school to study, not show off your fashion sense.
42	Uniforms provide an equal and fair social status based on personality and not appearance. While I admit wearing what you want is fun and creative, it is only fun if everyone can do it. For some children, that is not the case and they cannot afford to live up to their peers standards. Uniforms would make social life much easier and would give a more mature look to the school.
43	The school uniform is a good idea because it makes pupils concentrate more on their education and not their clothes. I believe that school uniforms instill discipline among pupils. It makes pupils with different material statuses more equal.
44	I believe that having a father is better than not having one. A bad father is very bad, and he probably will not do all the things that a good father would do, but at least you have the assurance that you have someone who is a father in your life.
45	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the best way for a child to progress physically and mentally. Therefore, a bad father is better than none. Additionally, people change. There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.
46	I believe that people are able to change. I would rather have the hope that my father could have been a good father, than know that I will never meet him. I would be too curious as to what kind of father he could have been.
47	Atlas would drop the world for a chance to shake his hand.
48	The growth in bottled water production has resulted in water extraction in areas near bottling plants, which affects nearby consumers and farmers. Additionally, two gallons of water are wasted for every gallon of water that goes into the bottles.
49	Water bottles can be made into fiber materials such as clothing or carpet. It is easy to simply fill a cup with water and re-use it.
50	TV is much more enjoyable than reading books from the past.
51	Television is superior to reading.
52	I love television so much that I can watch whatever I want. You can watch DVDs and play on PlayStations.
53	Most Americans recycle more than half of their bottle waters. Stop complaining that we do not recycle because we do! http://www.treehugger.com/culture/23-percent-of-americans-donatmt-recycle.html
54	Without plastic water bottles, there is only darkness everyday.
55	Until we get out of this recession, we will not be able to ban water bottles.
56	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships, or that it be called "civil unions." This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with minimal relative impact? I'm not arguing that law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my rebuttal to res0ndf7 for more on this line.
57	Gay marriage is not a thing. Marriage is between a man and a woman.
58	I am an American and I am ashamed to admit "Merica is rich due to slavery." India never had slavery and was once rich, until the British came and took everything away. India was left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America and soon when everyone has education, India will excel. India has the potential.
59	India is a secular state. People from all communities reside here. India has knowledge of almost all countries and the way they live. It can easily lead all the people of the world without creating any nuissance among anyone.
60	Indians have the potential to lead the world.
61	I say no because spanking does not really solve the problem. People can get over a spanking quickly and then do whatever they did before. It is better to be strict than to abuse a kid.
62	It depends on the severity of the kill. For example, if I knew it was done maliciously instead of in self defense, or to defend his family or belongings, I would likely leave and want nothing to do with it.
63	I would say that I would turn them in, because I do not think that is right, killing someone and getting away with it. Also, I would not want to be next to a murderer in my bed.
64	I would definitely turn them in, even if it bothers me. If a person commits a murder, they should not get away with it. It is dangerous to have them around. Also, if I do not turn her in, then I may become a victim in the future.
65	The government does have the right to tell women what they can and cannot do with their bodies. For example, a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states. She cannot take drugs into her body. She cannot murder others. She cannot steal. She cannot display her naked body in public. There are many more. Men can also not do these things.
66	I am pro-life, and here is a question for those who are pro-choice: Is the fetus in the mother's stomach alive? If not, how do you know?
67	In Nebraska, it is legal to have an abortion by killing the fetus as it is coming out of the womb.
68	There should be no argument about this. Regardless of how you view a fetus, it is still a living form that has been created intimately. You should not be changing what mothernature, God, fate, or whatever has decided for you. If you did not want to get pregnant in the first place, then do not have sex or use protection. Yes, there are some women that get raped and it is unfortunate, but they should give the child up for adoption. It is not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the raping being have to pay the ultimate price of its life?
69	There are many ways to avoid becoming pregnant, condoms are effective for both men and women, morning-after pills are effective for both men and women, the patch, pill, and other forms of birth control. It is the woman's fault that she did not use any of these. Perhaps instead of being pro-choice, they should be pro-life with exceptions such as those who are raped. This would ensure that all parties are treated equally.
70	If a woman is raped, that is a valid argument. However, why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime? If the woman does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I simply do not understand why you would kill the baby. The emotional trauma would happen regardless of whether or not the child is killed.
71	I believe that homosexual marriage should be allowed. Many people who do not support it do not like homosexuality at all. If two people are happy together, love each other, and want to be together forever, why should they not be allowed to marry?
72	The Bible is not the origin of marriage. Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity or Judaism. The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage.
73	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person.
74	If you do not like gay marriage, then do not watch a gay couple kiss. You are not obligated to tell people that their views are incorrect and that they must change their feelings. In the meantime, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to themselves. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.
75	In my opinion, personal pursuits are more important than helping others. While it may seem selfish, once you become good at what you do, you can help others do the same. Therefore, you are helping yourself and also helping others.
76	Politics is very useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretically. Why don't terrorists blow up every city here? Are you frisked every time you leave your house? No. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don't have to always be right but take time to learn. It is the media that destroys people, not politics.
77	First, I hate Bush. Second, I hate the Christian ethos that he is trying to push on the country. Third, I am a pagan, so I am not a Christian. Fourth, I am bisexual, and have had sex with men, therefore I am a threat.
78	It is as old as known history. The earliest civilizations practiced it back even in Mesopotamia, which is older than Egypt. I wonder how many blacks in America would be willing to go back in time and stop the importation of their ancestors. Africa has aids, drought, pestilence, civil wars, ethnic genocide, and no economy. America sounds pretty good after all!
79	If you want to maintain contact with your children, then you need to act as a father. California is fairly equitable when it comes to fathers. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you, unless you are found unfit. Do you have a court order? You need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction of the last court order. Good luck!
80	I am not a lawyer, but here is what I can tell you. "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation." The definition of "commercial advantage" is somewhat vague, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
81	No, that is the beauty of the United States of America; you have no health care. Why would it change if you had to go to jail while the rest of the public pays their hard earned money into taxes? Perhaps if your brother had contributed to society instead of committing crimes, he would not be in this situation. Jail has no company benefits.
82	Yes, if you execute a murderer, he will never escape, he will never hurt anyone else, and it helps the victim's family heal. The thought that a murderer is still alive disgusts the victims' families. There is something intrinsically just about executing a murderer, because the victim will never have another birthday or holiday with their families. Some crimes are so vile that the only punishment can be death.
83	Skating is not illegal, but skating in certain public places is. For example, when I worked at a store, kids skated on our sidewalk and almost killed some of our elderly customers. That is why it is illegal in certain places, because you could run over people who are just walking around.
84	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thought? How long will it take you to formulate an unpopular belief? Are you prepared to go to jail for your beliefs?
85	If you are the father, you can simply give extra money that does not go through the courthouse. Otherwise, you can request a review. It takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed. Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't. Don't listen to people who tell you that you should be able to support the child on your own. You did not get pregnant on your own, and you certainly shouldn't have to support that child on your own.
86	I agree that unless there is something in it for us, it is difficult to convince the US to send troops to police the world. However, when we do, I applaud it.
87	If you are connected to city sewers, you have to pay. Check with your city councilman. They probably negotiated a billing delay when they were first installed. Even if it was a city oversight. It is a service you have to pay for. They charged me extra sewer when I filled my pool, 6000 gallons worth, even though it didn't go down the drain. If they can charge you, they will. Especially if all your neighbors are connected, they don't give you a choice.
88	Most states do not have laws addressing minimum ages to babysit or minimum ages children can be left alone. Unless someone can cite a specific Illinois law, answers here are of little value. While 15 or 16 might sound like logical numbers, that does not mean the answers are correct on the law. I do not know Illinois law nor am I going to make up some number for you.
89	In a free society, there is no such thing as the "right" to not be subjected to offensive things. If you read the newspaper, browse the internet, watch TV, etc. you will be offended. You do have the right to protest peacefully, picket, etc.
90	I feel that this is totally against everything that is American.
91	I would say not all foreigners, but it would depend on which country they are from. The entire world has favorites and dislikes. I think the non-favorites for countries already know who they are and why. If a nation is violent and not good for the world, and the government lies, steals, and kills innocent humans, then it is not well liked. Neither is the people, because the government is supposed to represent the people. Therefore, it is the government that causes it and their people pay for it.
92	The United States needs a national driver's license. A standard driver's license will make the country safer against terrorists. Many of the September 11, 2001 terrorists had driver's licenses that they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you are putting in your bill. The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal skill with the English language, and proof of address. The bill will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. The program will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, so it will not need tax revenues. It will actually remove a burden from the states.
93	Is it correct to say that Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader, once wrote "you can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea"? In his writing, he was expressing the idea that freedom from oppression is spreading regardless of attempts to eradicate it. There is still oppression in the world, and there is a thirst for freedom from it, so why not? The same basic conditions apply as when Che was alive.
94	In a way you are making an interesting point. However, I would challenge you to think about this question from another angle. In my opinion, faith can and should inform public policy. In a republic such as ours, we have agreed to abide by the majority, until a new majority comes into being.
95	The court must overturn the conviction. Expungement of the records is another matter that requires more legal work. Even if that were to be granted, there is always a paper trail. It is practically impossible to get rid of all of the record, even with a court order.
96	If my neighbor smokes marijuana, it does not harm me, break my leg, or infringe on my rights. Therefore, it is not the government's responsibility to tell me what to do.
97	You are not racist for wanting your family to have equal rights as others. In fact, you should have more rights if you were born and raised in the country. Unfortunately, here in Britain that is not the case. We actually have less rights and receive less benefits if we become unemployed or sick as opposed to immigrants who get much more of our money that we worked for which they take.
98	Your crime does not fit under discrimination, as you committed that crime. That was a choice, unlike race, gender, etc... I do not think that everyone will turn you down, but I typically look at the crime when hiring. There are a lot more people out there with records than you would guess. If someone was a thief or violent, I will not hire them. Companies can refuse to hire for ANY reason. It may just be that here in Michigan the economy is so bad, and unemployment is so rampant, that there just aren't enough job openings. But, I would be honest about yourself, if they are asking.
99	"Hate Crime" laws penalize people more severely for their opinions than for their actions. For example, if someone kills another person because they hate that person's ethnicity or religious views, they will receive a harsher punishment than another guy who kills without hate, simply because he enjoys killing. The point is, you may be entitled to your own opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts and not just the act.
100	Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good because they are not permitted to give legal advice. That said, why don't you give us more details about the judgement. What was it for, when was it perfected, why you say that it is expired. What state do you live in? In California, for instance, judgements expire after 10 years. If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever. The only way to actually get it off your credit report is to petition the court to have it expunged, but chances are real slim on that. Otherwise, you're probably just going to have to deal with it being there.
101	I think you have a case. Did you happen to take pictures of all of the "repairs"? Sometimes the threat of small claims court will get them to write a check. You may have to pay a lawyer to write up the court documents, unless the clerk is willing to help you out. You did agree to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality. The fact that they tried to repair the stand indicates they insured the UNIT part also. Good luck.
102	Regardless of whether the police are there to protect you, if you have a person break into your house at night, you may not have time to call the police. Even if you do, and they are only five minutes away, you can be killed a hundred times over in five minutes. You have a right and a duty to defend yourself.
103	I think prostitution is overrated. If people want to have sex and get paid, then they are not. A woman can have sex with many men and get nothing. But if the men throw her a few dollars, she is a prostitute. Why? Why give it up for free. My opinion is if a guy friend of mine wants to have sex with me and my light bill is due, and I do not have it, then why not, get the bill paid and feel good while doing it.
104	We need to close our borders until we are able to take care of our own.
105	There are many types of abuse; mental, physical, neglect, etc. Perhaps she does not want you around anymore. A restraining order may provide some peace of mind, "If he is not around me, he cannot hurt me anymore." It may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier.
106	First of all, cops do not piss you off. You choose to be. It's called a victim mentality. You own your emotions, no one else. Secondly, since I am a cop, I can say this much... I remove skaters from areas that are posted with no skateboarding signs, where vandalism is a common occurrence or where there are trespass warnings. I do not, nor do I know any other officers, set out to "piss" people off. It is merely enforcing the laws that are applied upon them. You may not be a problem, but the two dozen other skateboarders before you might have been.
107	To an extent, what is commonly referred to as racial profiling is justified when it is not abused. For example, a car load of black or Hispanic kids are rolling around an upscale neighborhood at 3 am. Plates are run, and it is pretty obvious they do not live in the area and may be up to no good. I will say the same for a car load of suburban white boys driving around in high drug areas. That, contrary to popular belief, is also profiling. Crime needs to be controlled, and I do not personally see it as a violation of one's right's to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicous.
108	You are mistaken, they have not been shut down in India. The ban is only in Maharastra. The government had received many complaints from women about their husbands wasting money on these bars and not looking after their families. Also, many criminal activities took place at these bars. You may be aware of the Tarannum and Telgi cases where Tarannum's monthly income was approximately 1 lac and Telgi would throw away approximately 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on these criminal activities the Government of Maharastra had put a ban on these ladies bars.
109	The Lakota nation has contributed to the land by planting trees that were not on the continent at the time of Columbus's arrival. We grow most of the food we need to survive.
110	While some judges can be bought, they aren't even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliation, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case separately and as presented. However, some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world.
111	I do not believe that a man should have a say on whether a woman should have an abortion or not. I simply believe that, following a woman's decision to become a parent, a man should the have legal right to abstain from parenthood (the exact same option extended to said woman).
112	I am interested in hearing other views on this. If it matters, I am Christian, 16 years old, and male.
113	I do not understand how the adversarial judicial system helps to get at the truth. It seems more about how well an argument is presented than the facts of a case. Additionally, the jury, who are basically untrained (in terms of weighing evidence), decide which argument is better. What are the arguments in favor of this system?
114	I hate to be a downer, but I do not think humanity has another century left. I am not talking about human extinction. We will probably survive whatever happens to some degree. I am talking about society collapse. Humans may still be around, but in a Mad Max/The Road/Book of Eli type of existence.
115	For the international CMVs, the term "greece" refers to a social component of my university that throws parties every weekend. Each party has a theme and dress code. While some may argue that this is okay in a fun and humorous way, I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned. By allowing these parties to continue as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures.
116	I believe that the Wilhelm scream is too widely recognized and should not be used anymore without the audience acknowledging it.
117	For instance, prostitution stings and drug deal stings should be illegal. Anything that does not have a victim and does not cause harm to anyone is okay. However, setting people up for these crimes seems as if the police are shopping for criminals to take in. Baiting and reeling them in is often times a bad idea.
118	The title is self-explanatory. Vladimir Putin is the head of a disappointed ex-empire, willing to gain its former glory. The Russian people are traditionally obedient, willing to submit to an autocratic will, and ready to devote itself to general patriotic ideals (i.e. getting new territories). The guy seems very determined not to comply with Western moral and political values, and seems defiant to the present unanimity of attitudes against his latest moves. It is already quite obvious that Russia's stances in international politics is not a democratically generated one, but exclusively owed to Putin's will. He likes war, confrontation, and seems indifferent to the human costs of his actions. He is determined to make history by any means, just like the celebrity killers do their crimes to get unforgettable, no matter how.
119	I will try to keep this short and sweet. The race car is the better vehicle on all maps except the moon. The downside of the bike is that it is very flippy. If you get onto a hill and lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and then you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. The race car, once you gain forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill.
120	We are greedy and would remove it if it was useless. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min? I can see that many people in reddit disagree with this, however, and I want to know why so I can form a balanced opinion. So CMV!
121	I believe that a man's first love is his strongest love, and every following love is a bit less intense than the first love. This is similar to trying to match the intensity of the first love. After separating from your first love, your naive beliefs about love go away, and you start to see how hurtful love can be. Reddit changed my view.
122	The recent events surrounding Michael Jackson's death, which I believe was not truly accidental, have made me reflect on how his death erased most, if not all, of the bad he had done in the public conscience. This seems to be the general rule for people who die young, from JFK to Tupac. However, outside of the "never speak ill of the dead" adage, I can't understand why humanity keeps deifying the prematurely dead.
123	I fundamentally disagree that every individual has a right to live. If you are willing to put someone else's right to life in jeopardy, then you have demonstrated that you are a net negative impact to society, and that as a whole we would all be better off if you were dead.
124	I am not speaking about my parents here. They are wonderful people. I meant grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (Not brothers / sisters either, I am an only child.) Most of my parents' argument is that my family won't be around forever, and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would do anything for me. It is similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for you. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me does not mean I like them or need to care about them. I do not want them to help me. I do not need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
125	Requiring ID is a useless and inconvenient policy. I can understand why they would have it, but even following basic rational thought it doesn't make sense.
126	I believe John Hammond had a great vision, but he was underpaid by his HR department. The park would boost the economy of the Dominican Republic, as well as any other nation where it is opened. It would encourage kids to pursue science. The possibilities are endless. As long as we
127	Video games should be treated like a drug. Millions of lives are affected because people do not monitor their usage or do not use them in moderation. Especially children who are becoming consumed and obsessed, it takes over their lives and social skills. It is so sad. I feel so strongly about this because I went through the same thing as a child and I wish more than anything to go back and change it. Also, I am grateful because now I want to make sure this does not happen to anyone again. Let's start a petition!
128	It is pointless and I do not see a positive reason to use it. There are many better ways to communicate with people, such as: phone, email, instant messenger, video calls, and video chats. The apps have no meaning and are not that fun.
129	Iraq has taught us that brutal, repressive dictators have their place in the world. If this administration had any intelligence, they would have had a Delta squad ready to spirit Saddam away to his rightful place in the capital.
130	Professor X, Phoenix, or Apocalypse would be able to control, trap, or destroy Superman. Batman has no powers, only gadgets, Magneto could make short work of him. The Flash, who runs, could be taken down by Professor X, alone.
131	Yes, it will recover provided the government stops meddling and 'bailing out' measures. It is things like this that turned the potentially temporary market drop into a huge and horrid 'Great Depression.' As part of the'measures,' then instituted were some of the Union laws which are STILL crippling our ability to be competitive. I wish lawmakers had to take at least SOME relevant history while in high school.
132	I hear that science is "playing God." We have superceeded the need for natural selection, and we must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Since 1999, we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not necessarily a bad thing, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments, to the point that we are not aware of our declination. If God did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If God wishes us to stop, he is inhumane.
133	Unless every gun that is issued legally is tested with ballistics before being issued, so that any bullet fired from a licensed gun can be traced, if found intact, then guns pose a threat. It is like giving someone a jaguar as long as they promise to never let it out of their sight.
134	I do not know where you live, but here in Southern California we have pizza delivery services available until 3 a.m. Additionally, I would rather go to Del Taco than Taco Smell or Taco Hell. In high school, we would go there to cure our munchies and tacos were five dollars.
135	I see that there are actually no arguments, so I'm just going to clarify a few things for the 'Yes' argument. Even though Principals do obtain the right to search (for drug tests, even making the student take off his/her socks if the dog smells something on that student), they only retain that right in the event of reported drugs or crime, or in the case that sniffer dogs checks are enacted and the dog smells something. There are restrictions - a principal can't just demand to search a student's possessions on whim - outlined in the Criminal Code, YCJA and Canadian Charter of Rights (as well as parallel US laws). Thus, the right keeps the entire student body safe and away from harmful substances.
136	First of all, bribing a child is defined as saying things like "Now David, if you just put your shoes and coat on, mommy will buy you a toy after we are done at the doctor's office." or "Karen, if you take the garbage out, I will buy that blouse you wanted." These are all examples of things you say after playing with your child to get them to do what you want. From my point of view, bribing a child is wrong. You have to tell them what you want them to do and expect them to do it. Sometimes they may not like it, but they will still do it because you told them to.
137	I have had this discussion with my brother numerous times. First, the word'sublime' has multiple definitions, and none of them describe the band to which it refers.
138	If that is an interest of the young individual, then start early. It takes time to perfect, just like cooking. If they start early, they will not necessarily be a drunk later on in life. There are many young people who are not alcoholics but are still prone to be. I think what they should include in bartending courses is a better understanding of alcohol and its effects.
139	You dispute the Pontiac Pilate account and the testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene. And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption. The whole controversey is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead.
140	The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term memory. For example, if a dog has learned not to use the bathroom in the house through paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning. Perhaps in the example above, we are dealing with conditioning, not memory.
141	I strongly believe that prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and IQ tests. Kids need a good foundation to start a successful life with. There are some cases where parents are not that bad, and the kids strive to be different than their failure parents, but in most cases they are just a drain on our world. We need more intelligent people.
142	Marriage should be kept sacred because of what the man and woman will produce, a child. It is the best and most natural arrangement to raise a happy and healthy child. Marriage is not going to grow more branches of the tree, so it should be called something else.
143	Our monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely, and if allowed to continue, the likely result would be hyperinflation and another depression. When you give the government the right to print money that isn't backed by anything, you give them the opportunity to steal quietly from the public without anyone noticing. Finally, every nation in history who has switched to fiat currency has eventually gone bankrupt. Those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.
144	There should be a maximum number of debates per day, perhaps requiring others to wait until the following day, either through a filtered bucket or something similar. This would give people a chance to read current ones. I know someone will jump at the chance to call this an unfair debate, but I felt this had to be said.
145	The iPhone is the preferred choice of the majority of consumers, while the Blackberry is reserved for select elite individuals.
146	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music, but I would argue that America has birthed greater music. Blues and Jazz, which as we all know originated in the United States, are a major influence on British music. Additionally, Hip-hop and Punk are also American art forms that have had a major influence on the British music scene since the late seventies and early eighties. In terms of popular music, the United States leads where the UK follows and adapts.
147	Obama is more presidential than McCain because he is not only good at crisis management but he is also curious minded and cares about all people, not just the wealthy.
148	I believe that prohibition was a learning experience for our country. Without prohibition, who knows what would be happening now. We were able to see that it did not work, and we can decide better on circumstances like that in the future.
149	I would not want to live to be old and sick. Death is better than that!
150	I would say that this place is good if you like big burgers, but I do not. The fries are good, but I would not go there for them. They have bags of peanuts that you can munch on while you wait. The decor is similar to a 50's diner.
151	I will not return to Pulp due to the poor customer service and unsatisfactory juice.
152	I have been to Yama Sushi before, and while it is still good, I think they need to improve their service and the quality of the food.
153	I was hoping for a lot more than mediocre but I will not try it again.
154	We were lucky to have a 20 minute wait. This place is highly recommended, but our oysters were not shucked correctly and the muscle was still attached to the shell. I also ordered the Palace Pan Roast which was very good, but I would not return due to the long wait.
155	The food was not of high quality and the delivery driver did not have change.
156	My husband and I went to The Salt Cellar for our anniversary. The steak we were served was rancid. The experience made us decide to become vegan.
157	I strongly believe that wearing uniforms is bad, because it does not help students express individuality. It is also very uncomfortable, and during wintertime it may be very cold.
158	Firefox is significantly better. That is all I have to say.
159	I prefer Firefox because of the following reasons: Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (which I use when I visit Microsof.com).
160	The Internet is still trying to catch up to Firefox, in my opinion.
161	Firefox is much better. It remembers passwords with greater gusto. Add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love it: tabs, aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that allows you to display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work). The way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. Much friendlier and a better browser, and I do not care about whether or not I support Microsoft.
162	From a design standpoint, Firefox is clearly the winner. There are many beautiful skins available for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is clear-cut winner. Since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of all)?
163	I love Firefox and defend it, but this site is not functioning properly in it.
164	I am unsure. It depends on the circumstances surrounding the murder, and whether or not she killed in self-defense.
165	I would turn him in for murder. I would try to convince him to turn himself in first, but if that did not happen, then I would have to assume responsibility for him. Additionally, I would not want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I did not turn that murder in. If he truly loved me, he would not have killed someone.
166	I would not do that because I would have taken a vow to stand by them in sickness and in health. She might be crazy, but she would be my wife.
167	I would not be able to turn them in, if I truly loved someone. Especially if it was an accident. However, if he killed someone just because he felt like killing someone, then it may be different. I wouldn't want him to go nuts and kill me either.
168	Books improve grammar and spelling skills, plus they are more creative. With TV, everything is done for you. With books, you can imagine the characters, and the setting, with your own creativity in it. You can take books anywhere, everywhere, without disrupting anyone.
169	I do not prefer India to be leading the world in the near future. Yes, India has the potential, but corruption, this quota system, and the main reason for brain drain do not specifically help India in the matter.
170	It is better to be fatherless than having a bad father.
171	I would rather be fatherless than have a father who isn't good. Most kids look up to their dads, but if they aren't good fathers, then why have them around? It just means that the kid will want to be bad like his dad.
172	Raffles was the boss of Farquhar and thus should have been the founder of Singapore since he was the leader and had more rights than Farquhar. In addition, Farquhar did not carry out his duties responsibly and allowed slaves, cockfighting, and murders everywhere in Singapore. Singapore was so poorly developed that Raffles was unhappy.
173	Pornography is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. Pornography promotes the idea that sex is only about pleasure, but it is actually about love and affection as well. Pornography has inspired many crimes that abuse the rights and virginity of many people.
174	Are you a Christian? If not, then who is to stop you! For the record, yes it is wrong, but it is impossible to argue that if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs. Hence, my first point.
175	Why do you assume that God needs to operate within the constraints of time when you accuse him of wasting his time?
176	Until Firefox is preinstalled on PCs, IE will continue to dominate.
177	If Firefox is the best, why do people try to have sites that are IE compatible?
178	I have been an IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. There are some obvious differences, such as the availability of tabs in Firefox which is not available in IE. However, I do not find any other significant advantages to using Firefox. Additionally, now IE7 has the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities. Therefore, I think IE is superior to Firefox.
179	You need Internet Explorer to install certain websites that Fire Fox does not allow pop-ups.
180	I use Firefox, but until it is more mainstream, I will use Internet Explorer.
181	Yes, because it is a fun activity during the school day, and we get to have fun while exercising. Additionally, obesity is a problem in the United States, so this would help. Additionally, people can have a moment where they eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it, similar to the fat when we sweat.
182	The school I attend only has PE for middle school, not high school. Because of this, many students are out of shape and have developed many bad habits. As a result, during their first year of sports, their athletes complained that if they had PE, it would make training easier, and they were able to only complete three push-ups.
183	I have one more comment. It is interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER have not responded to my explanation of why I find adoption a less desirable alternative to abortion. It is funny how people simply ignore what they cannot or do not want to argue against. If you are going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all." This gives you a history of their arguments and may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they have already addressed.
184	I support pro-choice because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government.
185	The most frequent cause of abortion is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that satisfy both parties?
186	I am confused about the pro-life point of view.
187	A woman should solely decide if she wants an abortion or not. Why do most anti-abortion advocates favor the death penalty? Jon Jax, 71.
188	Please use the "Convinced me" link correctly. You are supposed to click this if the argument convinced you that creationism is true. Some of you seem to be clicking anything and everything on the right side. This will not help you win the debate.
189	The scientific method deals only with the natural world, creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
190	I am confused as to why you are speaking in favor of evolution and against creationism. You state that science does not have all the answers, but that there may be a halfway point between faith and science where evolution and creationism can co-exist. A great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea.
191	Not at all. However, in your line of argument, believing in "creationism" and "God" is like believing that a puzzle can be solved by waving a magic wand. I doubt God would actually touch the pieces with his divine fingers, would he? You clearly do not understand evolution. Read a book or two.
192	The person who said porn degrades women is wrong because she gets paid well, she chooses to do it, and some girls like what they do.
193	I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is ebil and degrading" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. As if there are no such thing as porn *actors." (What, men do not count?) Porn is a form of entertainment. No more, no less. Any arguement otherwise is "feminist" bullshit.
194	Pornography is not wrong, as long as you are not doing it behind your partner's back. It is only degrading to the women who choose to pose.
195	I feel that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself first will not be beneficial in the long run. I believe that helping others before yourself benefits you.
196	This is very bad, as the uniforms are also cost-effective.
197	I think school uniforms are a good idea. While I agree that many students do not like them, there are many benefits to them. For example, as previous people have stated, children do not have to think about what to wear. This is a major problem for teenagers.
198	Children need two role models; mom and dad. If a relationship is damaged, the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be fatherless, because the damage of a bad father would scar my personality far more than being fathered.
199	I think that it is better to have a father who is lousy because I consider my father to be a low level of lousy, and I think that I am doing just fine. I just think that knowing that you have a father is better. I think that not knowing him or what he looks like would be an insecure topic in my life. So, in my opinion. Just to know he exists would be better.
200	I would rather have a bad father than be fatherless. I would rather have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was.
201	A thirsty man will value a drop of water more than a sack of gold.
202	Yes, it is creating serious environmental issues. When people realize that it is also hurting us as humans, they may not want that plastic anymore.
203	The major water producing companies are stealing water from our lakes which in turn is killing off habitats for critters that like water, such as platypus.
204	The other side is posting song lyrics which has nothing to do with water.
205	He is the godfather of the godfather. He taught a German Shepherd to bark in Spanish.
206	I agree, I believe books are superior.
207	I think television is better than books because it is faster and some people cannot read.
208	Jesus loves plastic water bottles.
209	If being homosexual was natural, then there would only be six people on earth. Secondly, if homosexuality was natural, then the butthole would be in the front of the body. I'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some liberal venting on how it is unfair.
210	India's growth will exceed all other countries in 2012.
211	Indian people can speak English better than British or American people. This is true, "truth is stranger than fiction."
212	We should not forget Lord Rama, Krishna, and Vishvamitr who give a far view that India will be the Vishvguru in the future.
213	India is on a path to becoming one of the greatest economic powers in the world, with a rapidly growing population and an expanding economy.
214	Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't. I personally believe there isn't a God, but I can never prove this definitively.
215	I am an atheist and require evidence before I believe in magic.
216	I am an atheist because I believe that we all have one life to enjoy and preserve for all future generations.
217	Christianity is perhaps the most vile ideal to poison the minds of men. It's uses, motives, and fictional stories are quite plainly immoral.
218	Did I also mention that Christianity condones slavery? If not, I apologize.
219	Spanking can sometimes be good for the child to understand, but only if it is not painful and is not used repeatedly.
220	I believe some parents should spank their kids, but only when necessary. Sometimes, that is the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.
221	Spanking should not be an option for disciplining a child. Parents have many options before resorting to a physical punishment. It is better to discuss with them what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
222	Spanking children will not help their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, yet we do it to our children. It does not make sense.
223	I will turn him in to the police because he committed a murder and it is a sin. Perhaps if he is arrested, he will feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. Additionally, how can I trust a murderer? He could be telling me lies, and possibly could kill me for someone else in the future. Just by confiding in me does not make him clean and innocent.
224	If you got in a fight with someone and broke your hand or arm would you cut it off just because it would remind you of that experience? If you are sane then you would say no. If you are not then you need to see a psychiatrist.
225	When people condemned cannibalism in Africa, did they think about people's right to their bodies? No. Why should abortion be any different?
226	I do not understand how people can rationalize taking life. It does not make any sense. Regardless of the situation in America, how is killing legal?
227	I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, etc. In fact, make civil unions illegal. It makes it too easy to walk away from a relationship.
228	If heterosexuals are permitted to marry and do whatever they choose, why should homosexuals be prevented from doing the same?
229	One reason is that many more people now agree with this side.
230	To help advance a common good, you must first realize what your common good is. You have to know when you are a better person, so that you can then spread your good to other people.
231	I believe that a personal pursuit is more important than others'. However, I am unsure. If someone in your family is in need, you will do anything to help that family member. I believe that helping someone in your family is something you do no matter what. If someone in your family is in need, you will help that family member instead of a random person you do not know.
232	At this time, I would choose a personal pursuit. I have goals set and would like to accomplish them before I can begin to help others. Although I enjoy helping others, it is me who must be helped first.
233	I believe we should be able to die with dignity. While there are obvious needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent from predators, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, then they should be allowed to request medication to end their life. I have watched relatives die of cancer; no-one deserves to be forced to go through that process unwillingly. Those that want to should get all the support they need; those that choose to die early should be given the means to do so.
234	It would be a good idea to have facts about how they voted on any and all issues when they were in government. This way you know if this person is voting the way you want them to on the issues that are important to you. What was their absent record? After all, we are their bosses to some extent. I really annoy myself with the raises they give themselves. If there is something that should be put on the ballot, it is whether or not they should have a pay raise. However, it is all a bunch of propaganda with mudslinging.
235	The internet is still such a recent phenomenon, laws and policies are being created as we speak. Unless you are pretty certain they will be okay with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would be the right thing to do ethically as well. A lot of people create 'banners' for other people to put on their websites as a link to theirs. But some people don't mind if you put the URL. Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications, but my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you permission prior to your adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a matter of asking.
236	I believe that sexual harrassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening. Many people bend the rules of sexual harrassment in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from their co-workers. I think that policies against sexual harrassment exist only for the workplace environment. However, I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
237	I completely agree with you. DNA testing has made it easier to prove guilt, especially for paedophiles. As for the answer, it may not prevent further murders, but it is less of a burden on the taxpayer.
238	I detest it, but it is necessary for my husband and I since we own our own electrical company that provides 24 hour service. We get a lot of calls on our cell phones at night since we have our land line forwarded to our cells when we are not at the office. However, we always put our phones on silent or vibrate when we are in a public place so we do not disturb others around us.
239	I do not understand why the US should have a higher drinking age than other countries where the drinking age is lower and there are fewer accidents or other problems.
240	I think we need more rehab centers, but better ones. In jail they will never become productive members of society, and most rehabs are not very good. The good ones are too expensive for the common druggie to pay for.
241	It is legal to use race as one of several factors in determining admissions. The Supreme Court has decided that race cannot be used as a primary factor, but it can be used as part of the decision process. Although no company will ever admit to quotas in the job market, they do exist. Diversity is the new way of life for many people.
242	It is against the law to block a drive way, whether it is your own or not. If you block a drive way and an emergency arises, how will people who park there get their car moved if you are gone and you did not leave the car keys? Also, what if emergency personnel need to get to your backyard?
243	I think black people should not say either because it still is a word that divides races. If two black kids are hanging out with a white kid and they call each other the n-word, the white kid will want to say the word as well because he will always feel like an outsider if he can't greet them in the friendly manner they greet each other. On the other hand, I am one of the few African Americans who feel this way. And I do agree, why does it really matter so much to white Americans? You can't have this one word, you have all the other words to use plus you run the world, is it really so horrible that black people have this one thing?
244	This debate has made me feel that the government should not interfere with the marriage business. Churches should be free to perform marriages for whomever they see fit, and the government should record those marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to all. Plural marriages do exist, but that is another issue entirely. In my opinion, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents.
245	I am baffled by people who can be against capital punishment while being pro-abortion. Respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the liberal "don't kill convicted murderers, but kill all the babies you want."
246	I do not believe that everyone has the right to have children.
247	You need to stop driving because you have been towed three times and your vehicle has been impounded for 30 days each time.
248	If the remaining 97% were banned, wouldn't those women start claiming that they were raped, or that their health would not tolerate it? Then they would use metal hangers again, which is quite unhealthy. I agree that reducing abortions in the United States would be beneficial. Additionally, birth control should be administered to anyone having sex.
249	It would be similar to owning a block of land. Most islands are under the jurisdiction of a nearby country or are called a protectorate of a country. While there is a chance you could have local laws similar to a town, it is important to remember who is going to police them.
250	If your society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people on a racial basis, then there is no difference. That kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighborhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behavior. If white Anglo-Saxon protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, then they would pretty much match the criminal profile.
251	You are not hiring a lawyer on Yahoo Answers. You should see a lawyer in your state if you need legal advice.
252	I have always been bothered by pricing based on age. For example, movies. A seat is a seat. Why should people between the ages of 12 and 64 pay more for the same seat? And what is the point of a "senior discount"? I hear the same excuse that seniors are on a "fixed income." What does that mean? My income is not subject to change. In fact, younger people probably have more expenses than older people, with the exception of prescription drugs. And what is the point of "kids eat free"? Why can't I eat free? I mean, Geez, the kids aren't paying for anything. Let me eat every 5th meal free and I guarantee I'll come back to your restaurant.
253	I agree that although I do not smoke marijuana, I think legalization would save the government money. First, the government spends a lot of money trying to prevent people from using marijuana. Second, the government has to spend tax money to build new prisons, because so many people get arrested for possession. Third, the government could tax it similar to how they tax tobacco and alcohol, so they could potentially make Millions, maybe even more. Fourth, police could spend time actually helping people rather than trying to bust people for smoking a little marijuana every now and then.
254	If you confront this woman in person, she will despise you for having exposed her misdeeds. If you send the General Manager proof of her actions, he may be inclined not to believe the accusations. However, you must have all your facts completely established. Getting people to write their opinion will not be accepted as fact. You need absolute proof, and to show her intent to cheat and lie. She can always claim these were innocent mistakes or things done without her knowledge. Remember, you will need verifiable dates, names, events, and most importantly, a consistent story from each person who was a witness to any of these events. You do not want to come across as a whining malcontent. If you show indisputable proof, the General Manager will have to act.
255	I had the opportunity to visit Dar recently. To answer your questions individually may be difficult, but perhaps my observations while I was in Dar may help you find some answers. First and foremost, what I felt is that there is a general feeling of detachment in the general public. There is hardly any enthusiasm in whatever they are doing and have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told. There is a great amount of tired, laid back approach to work. I am sure Tanzania as a country has a lot of potential, but if you ask me my opinion as an outsider if Tanzania can develop into an exemplary country, my response would be "Yes, but there is a long way to go and a lot to change before that."
256	I often ask myself the same question. The administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his supporters with fear. They use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on September 11th affect how we live. The crayola chart is only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame. (Public servants). In the name of'I do not like that party ', people will side with him as well.
257	It is not an evil thing, and kids should learn that it is not. You should teach them about responsibility and how to talk to their kids about it. Jails are overcrowded now, imagine what it would be like if people were thrown into jail for that.
258	This situation has nothing to do with a lease. It is your business if you give the key to your apartment to someone, especially for the reasons you stated. No extra person is staying there, it is not a sublet, and you are doing nothing wrong. It sounds to me like your landlord is way too nosey. You are most definitely within your rights.
259	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. You are correct that it has not been used in a violent crime. I am not sure where it happened but so far only one person in the U.S. has been killed by a 50 caliber weapon and I believe it was a 50AE Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store makes it very impractical for any criminal. When California passed the law Barrett actually ended the warranties on the LAPD M99's and then came out with the CA legal.416 rifle. Then all the black powder shooters started to complain so California made an exception for.50cal blackpowder rifles! (which are easier to get by criminals).
260	Racism is a sad thing and we should all look at each other the same way.
261	There are many differences between Christians and Catholics. I hope this helps you decide which one is right for you.
262	The United States and United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists. Additionally, because they have been steadfast in the Global War on Terror, they are more likely to be attacked for maintaining that position, and terrorists are more likely to try to scare citizens of those countries. Therefore, the United States and the United Kingdom have been more aggressive than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
263	While I do not agree with the act of burning the flag, the freedom it is supposed to represent should allow someone to do so if they choose. Taking away people's freedom does much more harm than the act itself.
264	If that happens the US will pull all of our funding and any troops that are under their peacekeeper control. Without US support there is no UN. So they can try. I would love to get rid of that organization. It has done nothing but steal, bad mouth the US and Israel, and waste our money. We haven't done anything that we shouldn't have anyway. Well, the Bay of Pigs, but that was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry.
265	The First Amendment protects the individual's freedom to associate with whomever he chooses. As far as I'm concerned, if two men want to freely associate, they can do it as much as they like. However, the day you tell me that marrying another man is mandatory, that is the day I will leave the United States. No one is going to force me to get gay married.
266	I think that in the end it will be a gimmick. Why would the large supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans when they do not have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their goods? Also, we are all brainwashed on the money making "carbon footprint" idea. How do you justify flying food around the world just to help the poor? I do not think that the social elite will go without fair trade or organic food, due to snobbery.
267	I am very grateful that this woman was permitted to die without being at the center of a terrible storm of public controversy played out among people who don't even know her. Cold comfort, but it is all I have some days. I am very grateful she had family with her, shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her mother.
268	I believe that these acts of privacy invasion are deeply problematic and should not occur. If these acts of privacy are published, you and I ought to refrain from listening to or reading these works.
269	Almost all problems seen today (and throughout history) with corruption in government are that we allow them to be bought with their own personal desires and selfishness. If we do not allow them to have the possibility of wealth, then we can put a stop to a lot of corruption. For example, if a rich businessman gets into politics, he should give up all money and all other non-essential things. This will prove he is not in it for the money, but for the actual job. I know chances of this being implemented are slim, do not use that as an argument.
270	I have a very negative view of the IRA and those who support them. I believe that the IRA were bombing the Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to have territorial expansion into Northern Ireland. This is blatantly false and IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who are acting against the UK government.
271	Incumbents have an advantage of being able to grant political favors immediately, better financing, gerrymandering, and name recognition, so challengers need a boost to make it fair. This would cause higher turnover, which would be good. This would reduce the corrupting influence of non quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last. High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists. When a majority of representatives are freshmen, they will be more idealistic and less jaded, and this will help them serve the public good. I'm not sure how the best way to implement it is, but maybe just decrease incumbent's vote tally by 15% or so. My view is that something like this *should* be done, not that it's likely under present circumstances.
272	I will start by saying that I am a man who considers myself an egalitarian, humanitarian, and socialist. I do not like the feminist movement as from what I have personally seen from their views. However, from what I have seen, MRAs are the same. While I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (such as being seen as all being pedophiles, women being able to get away with more socially and legally, and males' lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors), it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about it. However, that is just my opinion. Feel free to change it!
273	Misinformed voting is a problem, and introducing a way to ensure that the voter had read the bill before they voted. I believe that this could be accomplished by trials in which sample populations who have not yet read the bill are given a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.
274	These cars have "systems" that make the bass boom so loud that you can hear it from hundreds of feet away. The music is usually terrible techno or hip-hop, and the driver does not benefit from the noise.
275	I understand that religion can be beneficial, such as teaching good morals and encouraging people to help others. However, I do believe that many conflicts have started because of religion, such as World War II, Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Another reason I think this is because other religions try to demonize one another. "Your religion is wrong and bad while mine is right and good! Let's fight about it!" There are also people and animals that are sacrificed for religion, people ignore science and rely on "faith", religious places (whether it be a church or temple, whatever) are always asking for money. Censorship of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs, etc. Not to mention people are voted into office often because of their religion. Suicide bombers, etc.
276	I do not believe the world's climate is static and unchanging. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and maintain their credibility. I used to be very interested in the scientific side of it, but I haven't been for some time. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change "denialists" are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
277	While it is great that this discovery will end the suffering of infected people and eradicate the potential to put more through that sickness, it will ultimately result in an increase in world population.
278	I have played the game and I do not understand why it is so popular. The gameplay is very linear, and the story is not very good.
279	Assume that mustard gas is only used on the battlefield and does not spread to other areas such as civilian areas.
280	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. However, to the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of a historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option.
281	Putting a large amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility.
282	It is a lottery and the better team does not always win. Shootouts are exciting and are a fair way to decide a game, especially at the World Cup level.
283	I was born just in time to completely miss the Pokemon craze. I see how it has become a cultural touchstone for the generation born after mine, but I have never had any contact with the cards or games. I have seen a few clips of the TV shows, and they look really bad. The games, from what I can tell, combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding. I think that Pokemon games are aimed at kids, and there is no point in trying them for the first time as an adult.
284	I believe the current situation in North Korea is not something to joke about. Whenever there is a mention of North Korea on Reddit, there is a good chance that a joke about it will follow. The jokes mask the reality of the situation and although a small percentage of the people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea is something we should be aware of and possibly take action to better the situation. I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the Holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights. And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang
285	I have a few gay friends that resent the LGBT acronym and transgendered peoples' "uninvited" inclusion with the gay movement. They feel that the transgendered movement belittles and muddles what is a serious political issue today. I understand that transgendered people wish for societal acceptance, but using the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to accomplish this.
286	I have observed or attended family member graduation ceremonies in the last few weeks. These ceremonies were not simple gatherings; they were full on cap and gown, commencement speeches, hours long, etc. I feel that celebrating all these minor milestones in the exact same way diminishes that walk across the stage for the student when they earn their diploma or degree.
287	The proof for Judaism is that there were 600,000 men at Mount Sinai. If that is true, then over a million people were gathered. It would be extremely difficult to fake something like that and get a whole nation to believe it.
288	This was brought on by a discussion with my girlfriend the other night. I want to know the arguments for her side, as well as the arguments for my side.
289	I have changed my mind.
290	The average American earns much less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. So why would anyone want to earn more than $70,000? What is the marginal benefit of earning more?
291	If anything we create is artificial, then we ourselves are artificial intelligence. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? If not, how can God love me or you?
292	I believe it depends on how the rich made their money. Some rich people came across their money honestly. They should be left alone. However, alot of rich people have come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means. For example, by hiring illegal workers who work for maybe $1-2 per hour instead of hiring a legal worker who they would be required to pay minimum wage.
293	First, we need to create three basic ideas about God: A. God is perfect; B. God sees all; and C. God can do whatever he wants.
294	Rowing is definitely more intensive, as the legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for a long period of time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument, however, assumes that the person has cross-trained for each form of event equally.
295	I believe environmentalism is a good thing, but recently I think it could be categorized as a cult. They obviously have some great views and do help the planet, but the thing that bothers me is "global warming". I think there is strong evidence that the earth is warming naturally because of the sun, not our production of carbon dioxide. These radical environmentalists are literally attempting to form a kind of dictatorship, where so many aspects of life are strictly controlled to stop climate change. Anyone that questions them is a heretic, and even with overwhelming scientific evidence against global warming, they persist. I am tired of overpriced "green" products, carbon credits, and attempts by them to waste billions of dollars and slow down America's economy.
296	Bill O'Reilly has an opinion and sometimes his opinion seems moderately justified and sometimes it is not. Similarly, someone like Keith Olberman also has an opinion which is sometimes moderately justified and sometimes it is not. Each can wield structured argumentation, and each will occasionally stoop to more base forms of persuasion. It is all permissible because the main audience is content in just winking at the sleight of hand.
297	I agree that academic qualifications ensure success in life because academic qualifications ensure you have the basics of learning. If you have strong foundations in math, science, and languages, you can achieve success in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, innovate, and communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
298	A recession is not always bad. An optimistic view of this recession is that all of the corporate world fat is being trimmed and weeded out, leaving only the best and most sufficient companies. While the short term job losses and price increases are bad, they are only temporary. The US has gotten out of worse before (late 70's early 80's situation, and the Great Depression).
299	The present day crisis was brought on by the automobile, petroleum, rubber, and construction companies after World War II. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists developing solar energy, they chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building highways and freeways, malls, and depending on fossil fuel while destroying the environment. This is simply a case of the chickens coming home to roost.
300	Perhaps not all teens; there is a good case for new drivers. Perhaps in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees, there should be restrictions on the number of passengers. Personally, I would also suggest a restriction on how far a newly licensed driver can travel on their own or with them as the sole driver. This would be difficult to police, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year from new drivers on their first motorway jaunt.
301	Monarchies are burdens to economies if they are parliamentary monarchy. There are many examples: British monarchy, Danish monarchy, Japanese. They have no real power and no political influence and are just living on the backs of taxpaying citizens. For example the British royal family cost the UK 40 million pounds per year.
302	You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for a short time, but each day, minute, and second of life you are learning new things about that person that would surprise you. Examples include: crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. In the end, you can never truly know what makes a person tick.
303	To state that nothing exists is to apply existence to something that is "nothing." To argue that nothing exists is to assert that nothing exists.
304	In this case, I do not believe that the Phelps Clan is protected by the First Amendment. They chose to single out one person's funeral, which is an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. Had they been somewhere else and stated their beliefs against all military members or gay people, then they would have been fine. But to single out one person in particular and hold signs up saying "Semper Fi Gay" and "Thank God for dead soldiers" is an emotional attack and should not be protected by the First Amendment.
305	In 2002 Ann wrote an article that caused quite a bit of controversy when she said that "her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics." While trying to be funny, this was one of the meanest things she has ever said. While she makes sense at times, that is still unacceptable. What do you think?
306	At 82 years old, especially in the 1940's, it may have been natural causes. I think if the government wanted him dead, they would have killed him a lot earlier when he was inventing things that could possibly be related to weapons. Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley would be much more likely to be killed by conspiracy theorists.
307	I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out. The iced tea was fresh and the restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies, etc. I could've taken pix to show how much meat was in the tacos, but instead, I ate them.
308	The place is relaxing, the terrace is nice, and the food is good, but the cash machine does not work. I would return for a coffee break.
309	The Cheesecake Factory is a good place to eat, but their food is not very inventive.
310	The first time I visited this location, I ordered a latte and was pleased with it. The second time I visited, I grabbed a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the woman in her underwear walk to the back to make it. She washed her hands before she got started but I was already over it. I did not plan on eating anything but politely waited. The yogurt parfait was a pretty fancy yogurt option after the long wait. Health code standards have gone out the window in the valley.
311	The ambiance was good, but the food was not very good. I had the gnocchi pesto which was very bland. I did not taste any basil, olive oil, or parmesan. I am not sure how that is possible. The pine nuts were just sprinkled on top which seemed lazy. The salad was brown and the house Italian tasted like stale parm. The portions were not very large for the price. I will return in the summer to check out "the most romantic patio in Cleveland." I hope that another dish will be worth it.
312	The waiter was very polite and attentive, but the food was very bland and boring.
313	I have been going to this place for years and have been satisfied most of the time. The food is consistently good and the portions are generous.
314	I think we should not wear school clothes because they are weird and also cause problems with bullying.
315	Is this a debate? The only reason to use IE is that Windows comes pre-installed, but from what I hear, that will also be discontinued. From speed to add-ons, Firefox is superior.
316	Mozilla Firefox can be used for everything. There are many more plugins, and themes are a nice feature. All of the innovations in E 7.0 were in Firefox years ago.
317	If my husband committed murder, I would not turn him in. I know he must have had a good reason to do it, and I love him anyway. I would not want my husband in jail.
318	I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for each other through good and bad times. However, don't misunderstand me, if my spouse were to get caught, I would not go down with her. Most likely, I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.
319	Normally, I would not turn in my spouse because of the love that binds us together. However, if it was murder, I would turn them in.
320	I am not completely against TV, but I do believe that TV is bad in large amounts and books are good for people.
321	India is full of corruption, each person has no time to help others, their only goal is to earn money in any way. Our manners and civilization are diminishing every day.
322	India will never lead the world if no one can understand what they are saying due to their accent.
323	As an Indian citizen, I do not think the GDP of India will increase in the next five years. They do not even have enough funds to feed all the poor. How can we imagine them leading the world?
324	It is difficult to not have a male role model to look up to as you grow up. However, I believe being fatherless is better than having an inadequate father. The reason is that you do not want to look up to a male who isn't living life to his full potential. Therefore, you will start relying on yourself from the very beginning without the need for a male companion. Additionally, there will always be other individuals by your side helping you to reach your goals in life.
325	I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a lousy father. I know what it is like. My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and I haven't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me, because I don't know him. And because he isn't around, I am never set up for any disappointment.
326	I would rather be fatherless than have a bad father. Having a bad father who tire to tell me what to do but does nothing with his life would just make me mad. I would rather be raised by my mom, who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works every day to make money to put food on the table.
327	He restored the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays. Farquhar, on the other hand, only wanted to gain control through his actions.
328	Pornography is wrong because you are being lustful. It is even worse if you are married because you are looking at another person in a preverted way that is not your wife or husband, which is cheating. I am not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
329	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there is massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
330	I am not sure why squirrels have evolved. I am pretty sure they have remained the same for thousands of years. How does an animal acquire a trait that it was not born with? Does it simply wish for it really hard and it magically grows? You have proved my point, species have certain characteristics and properties. I did not mention that their characteristics randomly change. By the way, I am just wondering, what insects are you talking about?
331	Since that time, Internet Explorer has always been available and is usually already installed on a typical computer. However, Firefox is not universal and must be downloaded or installed.
332	In my opinion, physical education classes should be mandatory in schools. If PE classes were mandatory in every school, there would be much less obesity. Additionally, health classes should be included so that children know how to eat properly and thus will not be obese any more.
333	Yes! Absolutely! Lack of physical education is the reason for your aunt or uncle being in the hospital. Lack of physical education is the reason for millions of people being overweight. Lack of physical education is the reason for you not sleeping well at night.
334	Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
335	He invited immigrants from Malacca to come and trade. He also stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform traders passing by about the settlement in Singapore.
336	Raffles does not care about the citizens, he does not spare a thought at all. Even though he discovered the island, he did not help in the least in Singapore's development. Farquhar did develop the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
337	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles.
338	Farquar dealt with many problems, such as rat and centipede infestation. It took Farquar a few days to completely eradicate the infestation, whereas Raffles did nothing about the problem at all.
339	The counter argument is, "What if the baby is to be the next DaVinci?". In that case, the person who gets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.
340	Life has existed for billions of years, so any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is due to researchers not putting in the same amount of effort.
341	If you are able, please provide us with your facts. Can you provide us with brain scans of the first humans? Or, average organ sizes, hair patterns, facial characteristics, heart rate records? In speaking of these factors, how do you sabrejimmy account for the different racial characteristics of modern humans? I am married to a Japanese woman. Why do we look so different? Was there in fact an Asian Garden of Eden? And an African Garden of Eden? And a... What do you actually believe?
342	I do not understand why the debate is necessary. We are here, so go on and live your life. If you want to believe in creationism, that is great, good for you. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side, but I do not see why even debating it is necessary.
343	I disagree with Phoebe and state that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur.
344	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator?" argument seems to apply here. A loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
345	I find it interesting that there are currently seven votes for "Porn is wrong", but no one is willing or able to give a reason why.
346	Everyone has intercourse, so making a profit on it is not wrong, it is genius.
347	Pornography is not wrong, because in schools that are never given an accurate demonstration due to parents. Pornography teaches, and gives prime examples.
348	The ability to do both would be amazing, but if I had to choose, I would rather help others in any way I can. Even a small thing can make a difference in someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with basic needs like food and shelter.
349	I think that school uniforms are a good idea. First, they make students look nice and tidy. Second, we can know who is studying in which school or who is in the same school as us. And lastly, it is convenient because we do not have to spend too much time choosing clothes for school.
350	I would rather have a bad father than not have one at all. Being a father is one of the best things that could happen to you. At least a bad father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father for anything. I think bad fathers are like that because they love their child.
351	I believe it is better to have a bad father than be fatherless. Maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea that you did not have one or with doubt about how it would be to have one.
352	I believe it is better to have a bad father than no father. You can count on your father to be there for you in good times and bad. If you do not have a father, you do not really know what is right or wrong. You do not have anybody to count on or tell your problems to.
353	I would rather have a bad father than no father at all. There will be a point where you need his help. It may not help, but you tried.
354	I feel that it is better to have a bad father than not have one at all. If someone is bad at something, there is always the possibility that one day they may be good at it.
355	Estimates place worldwide bottled water sales at between $50 and $100 billion per year. The market is expanding at a rate of 7%. However, bottled water is not sustainable.
356	Television is the best source for current events, as well as being educational.
357	The "Foxtel Go" app can be downloaded to the iPad so you can watch TV when and where you want.
358	When you are not bothered to do anything else, you can sit on the couch with some chips, a burger, or candy and watch TV.
359	Water bottles are a safe source of water and are guaranteed to be safe.
360	bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly distribute bottled water for various reasons.
361	While it is true that bottled water is a waste, bottles can be reused.
362	If bottled water did not exist, people would be drinking more sugary liquids because they would be the only portable drinks. As a result, people would become overweight.
363	Marriage is between a man and a woman, according to the Bible. It is clear that God does not approve of this, so does it seem ironic?
364	For anyone who wishes to follow these threads of arguments and rebuttals, it appears that chasbas' argument which I rebutted on Feb 07, 2007 07:09 has been deleted. I wish the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.
365	Guys and girls were made for a reason. That reason is not so they can pair up with the same sex. It is so they can pair up with opposite genders. Opposites attract everywhere. Besides, it just doesn't work with two guys (genitals). That is why there are female reproductive systems and male reproductive systems. They only work together, so there is only one way to reproduce.
366	I do not support gay marriage. My church does not support it. It bothers me that people who claim to be Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.
367	It is unnatural, as all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
368	It has the potential, but currently the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent this. Leading nations do not have time or resources to worry about internal conflict, they need to worry about other countries.
369	India and China could redefine the meaning of a third world country, because in the future, both will be first and third world countries simultaneously.
370	We cannot know for sure if there is a higher force or not, but Christianity is not it. First of all, Christianity is not one belief that every Christian shares. It is similar to a road with many different side roads. Ask a question about religion, and many people will find a way to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. Atheism, on the other hand, is very clear. It is more scientific, which I like.
371	My biggest problem with Christianity is that it is all about belief. There have been horrible people who are believers, but what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists? Is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature of reality is? I am an atheist, and I am a good person. The idea that a mere belief difference can seal one's fate is preposterous.
372	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are Christian or atheism. Shouldn't it be "theism or atheism or something else"?
373	Sometimes children need more "No" and "Stop" language to help them behave.
374	I agree that they must understand they were wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.
375	Atheism is based on science, while faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, while a religious person simply believes. Although I am a religious person, I think atheists can stand to hear because everyone is independent and everyone has their own opinion.
376	Parents should not use spanking as an option to discipline their children because it only makes the child angry and not interested in learning what they did wrong.
377	No, because hitting your child could permanently damage their mental health, as well as teach other parents that hitting their children is acceptable.
378	I would report them if it was self-defense or an act of rage. My conscience would eat at me, and I would not want to live knowing that there is a family mourning because of my spouse's actions.
379	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder. Whether it was by accident or on purpose, the police will determine that. Sometimes in life there is more to worry about than yourself.
380	I would argue in favor of "yes," but in reality, it depends on my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I would rather him kill the person than my husband die, but if he killed someone for no reason, I would probably turn him in. Love may be strong, but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer, because what if one day he decides to kill me?
381	The government does limit what a woman can do with her body. For example, it is illegal to commit suicide. If a person is caught trying to cut themselves, they could be placed in a mental institute.
382	Women have become selfish in their bodies. They believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake.
383	We are dealing with indirect murder when a woman decides to abort a child that she just had killed. A life that could have been a big contribution to society.
384	While I agree that physical education should be required in high school, I would suggest that it not be mandatory for all four years of high school. Perhaps, just having PE be an optional class and having one year be mandatory. In elementary school, it should be mandatory because children are more likely to gain and lose weight at different rates. That is all.
385	It is expensive, embarrassing for some, and unfair for AP students who are not in varsity sports because varsity athletes can waive the class.
386	Gay marriage is a personal choice. We should not limit the rights of gay couples to those of straight couples.
387	I am an agnostic, and I am an avid supporter of gay marriage. Marriage is said to be the union of two people who love and care about each other. Some straight couples get married for the benefit of having kids, but is that right? As we live in a developing society, more and more people are coming to terms with and agreeing that gay marriage is okay.
388	Helping others for the common good can make you feel proud, but you need the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuits. For some people, their personal pursuits can be the advancement of the common good.
389	You seem to be basing your argument on parts of our founding documents that do not exist.
390	It sounds to me like you have big trouble. CASA is Community Alternate Systems Agency, which is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If you took your child to a doctor or an ER and someone saw what they took for signs of abuse (bruises, etc.), they are bound by law to make a report. If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade. Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
391	The official reason is that they make an "orderly market." They must buy and sell to keep the market from experiencing sudden and dramatic shifts. It is also true that they make full use of opportunities to buy and sell when they can make money. It's an unpleasant trade-off. I do not agree with them or with this policy, but that is what is happening.
392	Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you, and your new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict would be if you had the same lawyer. This obviously cannot work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you did not cheat on your ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
393	The CIA leak was worse because Valerie Plame's life and possibly the security of our country were put in jeopardy. The media devoted less attention to this because the media companies who own the media are major Republican donors.
394	I agree that a woman should have the right to choose and that there are many children who need to go into foster care and live very hard lives. I am pro choice. I also think that if it is made illegal, then there will be a lot of women dying from having abortions in not sanitary or under conditions that are not pleasant. I could never do it, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that were abandoned by mothers who did not want or couldn't take care of these children.
395	Ethically, it is not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person. However, we have the right to know what the government is doing because it is with our money. Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us. Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock. The 4th Amendment has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
396	This guy is right. While I am not sure about the specifics of any Yahoo involvement, I am certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Incidents may have dwindled in recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America chooses to ignore it because we are more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
397	If you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then I say you should sue for compensation. Money will not change what those evil bastards put you through, but if you can get something positive out of the pain you have been through, then why not. I hope everything goes your way. You deserve it, and your family deserves it.
398	Most likely not. Few people will work for free unless there is a compelling social reason. You might be able to get someone to take the case on fee, but that will only work if you have a good case and a high potential settlement amount. Otherwise, prepare to pay. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) to get my training; I do not generally give work out for free unless there is a damn good reason.
399	I try not to get tangled up in that, but one thing I have noticed is his inability to be an effective public speaker. You would think he has the best speech writers money could buy, right? Problem is, I don't think he uses them. I almost think he just wings the whole damn thing, but who knows. I don't see a problem with speech writers, to be honest, if your a president of a company, or of a nation, what you say will effect many people. Hiring someone who is skilled in speeches and public policy is not only rational, but almost the only choice to properly convey the message you want everyone to hear. If you really want to hear how a person speaks, debates are a good place to start, since even though they have official "answers" to expected questions, they do have to be on their toes a bit more than when they give an address.
400	The Constitution does not guarantee the pursuit of happiness. That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law? For example, laws relating to the age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for 15 year olds but not 16 year olds? In other words, how do you draw the line?
401	The difference between the two is similar to dolphins and porpoises. The reason one is legal and the other is not is because the law says one is legal and the other is not. The actual difference between the two acts is hard to understand.
402	The justice system developed and practiced in the United States is the best that has been developed throughout human history so far. It is imperfect, but it is human. It is still the best we have come up with so far. No matter what the media may claim and promote.
403	You might be able to. Here is what I would do. First, gather all your receipts. If you do not have the actual receipts, well... you are scewed and might as well stop here. However, there is the possibility that the old pharmacy has your prescriptions on file and they may be able to provide you with a print out of your purchases. Second, I do not think the pharmacy will be willing to reimburse you. However, your insurance company might. Copy all the receipts, write a letter and fill out your insurance companies claim form. Send it all in and cross your fingers. Good luck!
404	It will take a lot of time for an attorney to prepare a defense for you, and no one here is able to offer you real help without knowing all the details.
405	I am not sympathetic. Three strikes equals life. You have been warned. Do not ask for sympathy because you were only busted for possession of marijuana. He or she committed other crimes that did not get caught. We are safer without them on the street.
406	The father has every right to demand that the child be given his last name, and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in. Why assume the man left? She didn't say that in her question. She only said they were separated. Maybe the mother is the one who left!
407	You signed a contract knowing you would not abide by it? The answer is yes. The property management company can place restrictions in the lease. Depending upon the exact wording of the lease, the key to this restriction is the word "loaded." Meaning you can keep an unloaded gun with a clip or speed loader nearby -- It will be hard to prove either way.
408	Unfortunately, you cannot reopen such a case, not without new evidence. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it probably will not help much. A valuable lesson is to be learned here- you were very young when it happened- your body had many changes to go through yet, and with Firestone's record, you should have had a clause put in the settlement (or not settled at all) that future consequences of the accident could be claimed.
409	If you do it in good faith, it is fine. However, if you do it in order to yell "I have a bomb!" in public places and then rationalize it by saying you were speaking in your new language, then it will not help you, and you will be convicted of "making terroristic threats."
410	I think it should be deemed as hear say and thrown out immediately. It is inadmissible evidence. First, his IQ is low, which makes him easily susceptible to coercion. He was coerced into confessing. Second, there is no proof he spoke the words he is said to have uttered. The wording and thought process are too complex for this defendant. He is too incompetent to be able to think of problems in logical progressions.
411	Since she signed for it, she can be held responsible for it. The only way to get her name off the loan is by disputing the signature on the promissory note. Otherwise, she's stuck. And, no, he will not get off scott free either. They can take his tax return to pay on it. She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.
412	I guess the feminists are still following Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer minority children.
413	That is only a Hollywood thing. I have been to court many times to observe, not as a witness, and I have never seen them do that. They only ask you to raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar.
414	Are you certain that you are accurately reporting the information that your attorney gave you? If your vehicle is parked on the private property of your employer, the laws of your state may very well give them the right to enforce this policy. Regardless of what you feel about the policy, chances are that you are an "at will" employee unless you belong to a union. I am not aware of any state or federal law that would protect you if your employer fired you for violating the policy. You have two choices: stop smoking, or go off the property to smoke.
415	It is still considered a "right-of-way" violation. The driver with the legal "right-of-way" is the one with the green light.
416	I am a writer and an ex police officer. These people will have you surgically remove their boots from your own. Send an official certified letter to the original publisher of the material along with a permission form to use their content. Also, if they do not get back to you, extract the info from another source. Protect yourself. Their lawyers will eat your lunch and not even leave you a Twinkie! Also, a disclaimer on your site is still a good idea.
417	It is difficult to think through every issue for yourself because there are so many.
418	I completely agree with this. While some may argue that this is barbaric and inhumane, it is also true that some people who have committed crimes against humanity still have human rights and a right to live. We would put down a dangerous dog, why not do the same for some of the people who live in our country? The justice system is not working at all.
419	You admitted fault in both instances. Read your written statement and you will realize that you have no argument in court. If you were struck by oncoming traffic it becomes obvious that you did not yield to their right of way! Your best bet would be to plead "no contest," accepting the courts verdict without admitting guilt. This will prevent you from appearing foolish by trying to argue an open and closed case, while saving face at the same time.
420	I try to teach my children that they should treat others the way they want to be treated. Therefore, torturing anyone or anything is completely unacceptable. Those who think that it is acceptable are completely barbaric and would surely change their minds once they have been tortured.
421	I am a law-abiding citizen, and I have a license to carry a gun for protection. I was able to obtain the license because I am not a felon, and I earned the right.
422	The American Disabilities Act prevents an employer from viewing an emergency psychiatric evaluation, and you have the right to sue if it is used against you. You need to make your employer aware of your condition, and if they fire you, you will file a claim with the ADA. Chances are they will deny your claim if you did not make them aware of your illness prior to employment. After the ADA reviews this, you will be given a "right to sue" letter. After the ADA reviews this, you can get a lawyer involved, who will argue that you did not make your employer aware of your illness prior to employment because they would have not hired you in the first place. Bottom line, mental illnesses such as bipolar are a disabilty. Additionally, you may also be eligible for Social Security.
423	Your question is hard to read for those of us that actually speak and write English. So, my answer to this is, which marriage were you speaking of? I am on my third marriage, and at my age, it would be foolish to act like a virgin this far into my life. I know others that are in their fifth marriage; do you think they should wait, too? Just exactly how holier are you than the rest of us? My previous two marriages had the exes walk out on me because of cheating, and I was not at fault. So, we should study that aspect more, don't we?
424	I believe it is acceptable to break the law if it would cause bodily harm or death. Additionally, if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate against certain people, it is necessary for them to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court.
425	I really enjoyed Battlefield Earth. The acting is not great, but it is a decent science fiction movie with a good amount of action. I liked the idea of post-war America and the references to Fort Hood, Knoxville, and other famous cities. Travolta gets his comeuppance at the end. I have to say, if it is on, I tend to watch it. To give you an idea of what my five favorite movies are, in no particular order: Shawshank, Godfather, Inside Man, Animal House, and Goodfellas.
426	Here is a definition from the Oxford Dictionaries: Pornography: "Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings." Explicit: "Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion." I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because they were "pornographic" when the text is not sexy or titilating. I have heard many people say that pornographic is to be defined by the community. Without an understanding of the difference between pornographic and sexually explicit, community members are not at liberty to define either term.
427	I do not care who wins or what party they belong to. I think that regardless of whether it is the Liberals, Conservatives, or NDP, some good things will get done, more bad things will be done, there is a 25% chance of some major scandal, and corruption will definitely occur. This is my analysis without taking into account my personal political beliefs.
428	Instruments have many limitations compared to computer programs. For example, you cannot control the frequencies of the sounds you are making as well as you can with a computer program. Therefore, people will spend years learning how to make a single sound instead of all possible sounds. This is similar to being a soldier compared to being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it is a waste of talent.
429	I have been debating this issue for a while now, and I cannot think of a good answer. I have always believed that killing an animal for food is morally correct, because animals do not understand death like humans do, and will have a wonderful life in the wild regardless of whether or not I kill it. As for producing animals for food, I also believe this is acceptable, as long as the animals are treated well and fairly. This is why I am a vegan currently, because I hate how the main meat sources we have come from horrible people who treat animals with unneeded cruelty, or at least it seems like they do. I am also asking, is it wrong to actually eat meat from these factories? People make it seem like it's horrible, but I just don't know. Any pro and con arguments would be helpful. Thank you!
430	I have few emotional connection to the college I am finishing. The college is not prestigious/well known for the area I am studying, therefore the coursework was not as rigorous as it could be and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies to me little dedication towards studying and finishing my course work is frankly embarrassing.
431	After a marriage ends, unless a prenup is signed, one partner usually receives alimony from the other. I think this is wrong, and selfish of the people who receive it. If someone gets a divorce, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid, I think. If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them consider their choice and options. Obviously if they had kids together the partner should send the person the kids are mostly with child support to help take care of the children, but money just to take care of the adult they didn't want to be with anymore? hell no. They can get a job.
432	While watching documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. I have gone back and listened to a lot of bands like Mudhoney, Green River, Sonic Youth and others and I am sorry to say I never heard anything close to a "Lithium" or "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Those songs are magical and have beautiful, haunting and unforgettable melodies. There were other great bands that are in the same league like Pearl Jam and to a lesser extent Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. However, I do not buy the argument that Nirvana were "just another band."
433	I scroll through Reddit and there are sections of comments that I cannot understand. People talking about spaghetti and Transformers movies. Karma is flowing freely, but no original thought has been had.
434	While the definition of privilege in academic terms makes sense, I think it is mostly used as an excuse to dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with.
435	I am influenced by the IAmA submission from the man who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. However, really? How are hunters more morally and ecologically irresponsible than poachers? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Anti-poaching initiatives are hypocrisy in themselves. First, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Second, it does not stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.
436	The realism in games such as Call of Duty and Battlefield mirror that of the cop and soldier training simulators designed to teach people how to shoot others. Observing depictions of human death and suffering has become the past time for millions of kids around the world. To think that the mind is not being trained to be more violent through media seems illogical to me.
437	I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it seems like a good idea at the time, it ultimately just temporarily hides a problem.
438	I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one: smarts. If you're smart, you can be wheelchair-bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world. For example: Stephen Hawking. He has almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He's still successful.
439	I believe that no one should be allowed to be a permanent member and that the five countries with the most influence on the world (defined through a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records) will lose their seat. As for the rest of the seats, they would be filled as they currently are. As for veto power, I believe that it is overpowered. For proof of this look towards North Korea. I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to get action on an issue I understand that this is two part, but they go together so I thought it should be ok to put them in 1 CMV
440	I do not view suicide as a choice. It is a fight or flight response. Some people cope, others do not. Also, my philosophy on the value of life undoubtedly skews my stance. I do not believe that anyone has an objective, inherent value and that disallowing someone to end their life promotes their suffering for the comfort of society being uncomfortable with death. However, temporary bouts of suicidal behavior should be treated, but at a certain point it becomes chronic, and pain overshadows pleasure. When someone has suffered for years with suicide but have held off because of guilt from family, they are literally tortured into accepting life rather than be allowed to bow out peacefully.
441	I do not want to come across as if I am speaking ill of the dead. I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention. Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has. Here are some reasons: She ruined both of her marriages because she slept with other married men. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is that she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement), but she should in no way be considered a role model to women. Any woman that exhibits this kind of behavior today would be considered to be an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone?
442	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to despise Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80's she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after despite massive public outcry. During her time as prime minister, Britain's old industries decayed and poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. Recently, to my disbelief, I met a man from London who believed she was a great leader. I cannot stand this woman and how anyone can respect her is beyond me.
443	I watched Drive in the theater when it came out several years ago. Almost all of my friends absolutely love the movie. They give the following reasons: artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting, etc. Now I do not hate the movie, but most of my friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year. I thought Gosling's character was very bland, and he was nothing more than a pretty face who had violent tendencies. The other actors were good, especially Cranston, but nothing award winning. The soundtrack was really good, but did little to elevate the movie to a top 10 movie of the year status. All in all, I thought it was a boring film (with the exception of the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere. Viewers who loved it, can you CMV?
444	I am strongly against HFCS because, while it is cheaper, it is by no means better. Here are some reasons: 1.) Any type of artificial sugar can cause obesity or even cancer. 2.) Factories that produce HFCS are very unregulated by the FDA. Tests have proven that there are contaminants of mercury in some batches of HFCS. 3.) HFCS and cane sugar are not biochemically identical, and our bodies do not process them the same way. 4.) The corn industry is very corrupt and has been causing local farmers to go out of business, having a detrimental effect on the US economy.
445	This happens frequently on the internet and in real life. Someone makes a comment and someone else responds with "that's racist." This is a trump card that many people believe instantly discredits any argument or observation.
446	Bleach is a good anime, but the quality is not comparable to FMA.
447	Although eBay serves only as a marketplace connecting suppliers and consumers, it is better from an economic perspective. With no firmly set prices, eBay's market closely resembles an internet-based free market, where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. This is a self-targeting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency.
448	Final Fantasy has better graphics and a better story line. Kingdom Hearts has some good features but you fight little black creatures called heartless and grey empty bodies called nobodys. Also, some Final Fantasy games are turn based which is nice. The Final Fantasy Trilogy has been out longer than Kingdom Hearts and I have played the first one many times.
449	Debate about the existence of God is futile because there are no concrete arguments that can be presented to prove or disprove his existence. It all comes down to faith.
450	Global warming is an issue that affects the entire world. America prides itself on being able to rush into another country to "save" and "liberate" it from evil forces. If the United States is serious about helping the world, then it needs to pull its weight on the global warming problem.
451	The arguments against torture are numerous, but the most important one is that it does not work. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy. That just does not happen in the real world. Another argument against it is that we are supposed to be the good guys. How do we expect to maintain our moral superiority when we degrade ourselves by stooping to the level of our enemies? If someone wants to argue that we need to get down to our enemies level to really be effective in the war on terror, shouldn't we have rounded up all the German-Americans in WWII and burned them in ovens? Shouldn't we have gotten down to the German level to be really effective? I don't think the U.S. can seriously dictate to other countries when it doesn't follow the dictates of its own Constitution.
452	I have two reasons: - Let all children be wanted; knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be emotionally devastating to some. - Anyone who does not want their child so badly that they would have them terminated would not be a good parent. If they could care less about their child, the kid will grow up uncared for and possibly even abused, malnourished, or neglected. Here is my solution: once you find out you're pregnant (unintentionally), immediately look for an adopter, and if that fails, get an abortion.
453	The poor need help! The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer unless we intervene. Having poor people exploited is bad for society. No health care, no political and legal representation, and there will be blood spilled with a revolution. This does not mean taxing people 20%. Rather, it just means making it a societal goal to help the poor and invest in the people.
454	I watched the original debate in the Houses of Parliament on TV. It made me wonder about this. I think if the steps had been taken to secure a binding resolution, the benefits of having all seven member nations on board would have averted much of the disasterous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
455	Engineers have recreated the diesel engine so that it is no longer loud and polluted. Until we get more efficient electric and other technologies it seems like a great stepping point. Also, hydrogen as a combustive fuel is being researched right now and seems quite plausible.
456	I did not create this debate, and I will be arguing for Rugby. There are three main reasons why I believe Rugby is superior: 1. Rugby is a combination of the two most basic forms of athleticism, running and wrestling. They run a lot. 2. Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody. 3. No pads. Rugby hits are just as hard, but there is no armor to stop the blow. Skills are just as complex and beautiful, but the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers. Sport in the raw.
457	Marijuana has been used for many health benefits for over 5000 years.
458	I disagree. You are in effect forcing individuals to make contributions to charities without their consent. Instead, set up voluntary support associations, with reasonable criteria for the support applicants, and I would be interested. Provide tax breaks to those who contribute (this already happens when you contribute to a recognized charity). Provide insurance benefits only to those who have contributed in the past. Even require applicants to pay back the dole they've received, if you wish. But do not tell me what a worthy cause is. That is my decision.
459	College athletes do get paid, but the question is not whether or not they get paid enough.
460	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. By starting fires in civilian areas, the group fits the definition of terrorists.
461	Like private schools, religious schools earn money from their students. This money goes directly to them, unlike public schools who have to rely on community fundraisers and events. The money given to private schools is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity. You do not know how they will use the money, nor do you know how it will benefit their students.
462	I do not understand how cutting someone's hair, like a child, would straighten them out. For most kids, it would not really teach them a "valuable" lesson. From personal experience, there is no reason to cut your child's hair as a punishment. If it does come to punishing them, there are better ways for them to learn what they did was wrong.
463	Criminal gangs are criminal gangs, no matter who they are made up of. If the police are not allowed to protect the population from criminal gangs, ordinary citizens will take up arms to protect themselves. While it is understandable, this is not good for the rule of law. Therefore, 'political correctness' must not be used to prevent police from doing their jobs and keeping the public safe.
464	I was very disappointed in this place. I have been going to a ramen place down the street for quite some time and always leave full and happy. I came here because of all the hype about pho, but I would pick ramen over pho any day. The egg rolls were very good, but that was the only positive thing about my dinner.
465	This place is ghetto and they had to break up a fight at 11pm. There were only about 25 people in the restaurant. The server was alright and they were out of three types of tacos and sour cream. Service was a little slow for a weekend night. We enjoyed the company of our friends but we probably won't be returning.
466	My family and I have always ordered from this location for over ten years. Our house number ends in 4949 and I, Sherie Arvayo, call from my cell phone. Recently, the employees have shown poor customer service skills and have hung up on me when I attempt to explain something. We have decided to go with Papa John's because their employees are professionals and friendly.
467	I usually enjoy my experience here, but this last visit was not so good. The food was fine, but the service was not great. The server took our drink orders first, before taking our dinner orders. Perhaps the staff was not enough.
468	I love this place and go there often. The food is great and the staff is very personable. If you have a birthday coming up they will give you food for free.
469	The bartender was rude and immature. She was eating at a table and was the only bartender, which meant having to go to her for drinks. There were very few people despite it being a Saturday evening, and I understand why. We asked for chips and salsa. She said they only had nachos. We asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us. So, I guessed they have chips and salsa and asked her if she could bring them out next time. She told me I was being confrontational. I told her I am in the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out. She said she was just looking to get her attention. I will never go back there again.
470	We went over for drinks. My friend had the Mac & Cheeze and said it was really good. She even got some wings to go because her man loves them. The outdoor seating was really cool, although that day they allowed some kids to come in and they were definitely obnoxious. Other than that, I think it's a really cool and chill place to hang and drink.
471	A school should not attempt to hinder the creative expression of their children.
472	It does not show children's expressions and uniforms do not show either.
473	I want to bring attention to the issue of wearing school uniforms by high school students. While it may seem counter-intuitive, this practice only causes problems for students and teachers. People aged 16-18 do not like being limited, and sometimes limiting their freedom can cause serious problems. Furthermore, controlling behavior should be done in childhood, not at an age when students become adults.
474	Uniforms do not correlate with higher learning at school.
475	Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used it. The only memory issues I've encountered are when opening multiple windows at once or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (a known issue which a simple restart will fix). Argumenting for IE7 in favor of Firefox...weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars, customizable buttons? Who needs em!)
476	There is no reason to believe that Internet Explorer is better. Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and more sleek. You can customize it to look the way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!
477	It is something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she will definitely learn from. She was brave enough to tell me about it, something not many people would do. I am fairly certain that was not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not told anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!
478	If my husband committed murder, I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite. I would help him hide any evidence, move if necessary, and I would never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, so there or it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in the one I love.
479	Have you noticed that those who are against books have terrible arguments? For example, that person who said "TV is awesome" in all capitals and with exclamation marks. That clearly proves that books are better than TV, because TV rots the brain.
480	India does not have the potential to rule the world. The reason is that the people are not good.
481	Being fatherless would ensure that your only heartaches are his absence and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and then walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. In my opinion, having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence, because either way he knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
482	This argument could go either way but I would have to agree that being fatherless is better, because in my opinion a lousy father is a father who is never there when you need him. Also, he is never there to listen to what you have to say.
483	I think both being fatherless and having a bad father is depressing. However, for me, I would prefer to be fatherless. At least I know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if I had a bad father and he did not care about me. In this case, I have a father but he is not here in this country. I understand that he left for a good reason, but I still need him here to support me.
484	When Raffles returned after a time away, he changed rules and concepts Farquhar had set according to the people's needs. This shows that he cared about the people.
485	Although it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas, and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence, it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas.
486	The definition of founder is not a person who discovers a place, but Prince Sanila Utama is the founder of Singapore.
487	Porn is bad when it is not used in moderation. People who are addicted to it, expect all women to look and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about. It makes their reality very different.
488	I become suicidal when I think about the one I love most having relations with other women.
489	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. For example, in the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for rock strata. However, radiometric dating was not invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
490	The point is that this universe cannot have just appeared. There must have been a creator.
491	I meant that in the situation, both moths were present at the time of the observation. Then, the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution.
492	We have come to a point where the only way for mankind to evolve is to create. This is the same as evolution, however, there is more responsibility for mankind.
493	Could a higher power that has not been proven have created a perfect world that appears to have existed for more than 10 million years when in reality it is only 1 million years old?
494	Spam and Adware seem to be more compatible with Internet Explorer.
495	I believe physical education should be mandatory because people need their exercise. If they do not burn enough calories, they will become chubby. During those classes, they should be stricter, because most of the time people just stand around.
496	Of course Physical Education must be taught, but it should not be compulsory because some people are not fit enough to do the extensive exercises performed.
497	This will help kids learn leadership and discipline qualities. Additionally, this could lead to help childhood obesity.
498	Definately all those obese kids need exercise, and it is a vital part of life. Of course it should be mandatory.
499	I agree with everything she said because children should learn how to live a healthy lifestyle. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so less people in our country are less likely to be obese.
500	Our kids are mostly out of shape and eat junk food.
501	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea, but the implementation was left to Farquhar. Therefore, I believe Farquhar is the rightful founder of Singapore.
502	I like to think that both are true. First, God created the first things (I don't think Adam and Eve were really human, maybe single celled, but man had a hard time believing that, so we made the first creatures man). Second, those things God created evolved to fit their surroundings. (There is proof of this, you can not deny this. I do not know if we came from monkeys or not.)
503	I apologize, but I do not believe in God. I only use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments.
504	You are falling for the old argument that the universe is controlled by a single watchmaker. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment.
505	I am annoyed with people who argue that porn leads to addiction. I watch it once or twice a day when I am alone, but I have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three times a week), we use it to spice things up in the bedroom, but we know it is all fantasy. We are not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
506	I am a female who watches pornographically, and it does not bother me if my boyfriend watches it. I think it is natural for people to have sexual desires.
507	I volunteer at Irving Cares. When I do, I feel great about helping the community. In a personal pursuit, you are helping yourself. The world would not be better if we all just helped ourselves.
508	Efforts to make advancements for the common good can change the world forever. Many people have succeeded in doing so.
509	Simply written, seeking to advance the common good allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey or series of considerate acts one can have an easier time pursuing a personal goal or lifestyle.
510	They help people to choose appropriate clothing for their situation.
511	I try to see things objectively, but sometimes I would rather have a fatherless father. In my opinion, having a bad father would be better for me, because growing up and being ready for life requires that you learn about life, and if you do not have a positive role model or person to look up to, life may become more difficult or less enjoyable.
512	It is better to have a bad father than none at all. You can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better." He will love you no matter what.
513	I would not live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I would not care if I grew up with a lousy father, even if he had no job or life and maybe even an alcohol problem. Having a father means so much, especially if you are a boy. Most fathers are friends, so you can talk to them about your problems and they will understand, whereas if you only lived with your mother, you could not because your mother has different views then a guy. Whether your father is good or bad, he will always be there for you at some point in your life.
514	With our water bottle consumption on planet earth, we could cover all of Mexico three times. That would be a lot of "rich" in their minds Mexicans.
515	For example, Pepsi's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines for the same price as soft drinks. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon. So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink?
516	TV is better because you can explore the world while sitting on a couch.
517	I learned English through television. While technically, I learned English through interaction with native speakers, television helped me understand the language much more than books.
518	Television has made children enthusiastic and confident. As a result, they improve their academics and increase their ideas and innovations.
519	During the last ten to fifteen years, bottled water consumption has grown exponentially worldwide, with a focus on North America and Europe. This growth is beneficial to American industries.
520	Our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits is not bottled water. All other beverages consume large amounts of water and energy during their production processes, which causes their ecological impact to be far greater than that of bottled water.
521	I believe that gay marriage should only be between a man and a woman.
522	India can lead the world. I agree that there are many problems, but we are improving.
523	I am a new person to this forum, and I would like to ask you to consider this before you speak: the wealth that the foreigners are enjoying now is the looted one from India. The other foreign countries are more developed than us because it is the Indian people who are using their brains and making the foreign countries develop.
524	India has the potential to lead the world. Therefore, many countries depend on scientists. Additionally, most employees in every country are Indians.
525	Religious people always use the same argument: you cannot prove that he does not exist! You cannot disprove a negative!
526	God is not real, so stop believing in God.
527	I believe spanking should be an option, but only as a last resort.
528	I believe that spanking your child is effective because it teaches the child that what they did was wrong, and if they do not want the feeling of a bottom wobble, they will not make the same mistake again.
529	I have a personal relationship with Christ and I believe.
530	I cannot imagine a life without God. In fact, I can, it would be hell.
531	We should not insult who we believe in. We do not need to know what other people think.
532	This debate is ridiculous. How did we get so perfect, the earth, sun, and moon are in the correct spot, our bodies function perfectly, our hands are made distinctively? Because we were made after God's own image.
533	People should not hit their kids because the kids will think it is okay to hit someone else back. For example, at school they will end up fighting and being abusive to others.
534	No, children do not always need to be spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different methods.
535	Is personhood absolute, or does it change depending on the status of the person? If a premature baby is lying in an incubator or a five gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change dramatically when the child is inside the womb?
536	I choose life. Keeping the law pro-choice is as if women are murdering their own unborn human child.
537	Physical education has been around for over 200 years. However, today, it is not having the desired effect due to the increasing consumption of unhealthy foods. We should develop better methods to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
538	Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.
539	I had muscle cramps all over when I was doing intense exercises like a long run. People are all different, some have more stamina than others and are able to do long distance runs and other intense exercises. In contrast, people like myself have less stamina and are only able to do less intense exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?
540	Physical Education is not needed to graduate school.
541	In my opinion, I do not care much about gay marriage. I think it is wrong, but it does not make a significant difference in society. If you want to get married, do it. It is your life, you make the decisions and choices.
542	I think it depends on perceptions. We have no right to go against it.
543	Unfortunately, it is human nature to be selfish. This does not always mean that you will always be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes, pursuing your personal interests may actually advance the common good. We only live this life once, and we want to be the best we can be. Perhaps your personal interests are to advance the common good.
544	A personal pursuit is better because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others, but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others, you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.
545	I believe that focusing on a personal pursuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I do not think there is a day when you will announce to the world that you are going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money. In the end, if you are ever in the position of power and have money, you could truly advance the common good.
546	No one enters court justly; no one goes to court honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity. Therefore, justice is far from us. Judgment is turned away, and justice is far away. Truth has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter. Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.
547	You are wrong. What you have is a court order for you to appear in court to answer a motion to collect a debt. If it is on court paper and has a case number, call the court to confirm the docket number, and find out when the hearing date is. Yes, they do have that power. Yes, that is the equivalent of a subpoena. If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it gone! What you should do: Seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you. Do not hesitate. You will regret it.
548	We all have busy schedules, but it is your civic duty to participate in some way. There are specific criteria that will relieve you of jury duty, but you still need to show up. Also, do not try to be rude or prejudicial in the courtroom. You can be held in contempt and perjury in a courtroom is very expensive.
549	Since Bush got away with tax payer dollars funding Faith-based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional, no politician will touch it in fear of being painted anti-church, there has been a movement in this country for more religious or power of the church. People do not realize how powerful the Catholic Church is. Do a little research and check out how wealthy they are. There is no way they are going to like China not 'obeying' their (not God's) rules.
550	Australia has no basic human rights under the constitution. We have no Bill of Rights like in America. Any rights we do have are established by the courts. In relation to your issue, contact a women's legal service or a women's shelter for advice. The question may be whether he has bashed the baby as well (or is likely to), but I am not a lawyer so do not know for sure.
551	The district attorney will not touch the civil charges, so you will need to deal with the criminal charges first. Gather evidence and prepare to defend yourself at the criminal trial. If the district attorney wins, your case may be destroyed, but if he loses, you will be in a better position to sue the witness who you believe lied. You can sue in civil court, and you might be able to sue in Small Claims without a lawyer.
552	Bush assumes it will put the US at risk of loosing the edge in industrial production. The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in America. To adhere to the standards, America needs to upgrade a large number of industries.
553	The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, states that if one uses another person's computer service without permission, they have committed an offence. The law has been around since 1993. From your post, I would assume that your friends made use of the other party's router fairly recently. As such, if they are caught, they can be prosecuted. Arguing that the router is unsecured and/or does not have a unique SSID is futile; it is common sense that the router has to belong to somebody and if you are not in a free wireless zone, such as McDonald's, then one should know that any access would probably be going through a privately owned network.
554	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but it was done in response to the suicide bombers. They certainly do not respect others beliefs and truths. What is the difference?
555	I would say if that was the only issue that caused your break-up, then yes, get back together with him.
556	It depends on your state. Here in Nebraska the legal majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that require support through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a swift kick in the pants!
557	The US does not want to steal Iraq's oil. It needs to control the world trade in oil. Basically, require all oil-producing countries to market their oil in dollars. Compliant Arab regimes also re-invest hundreds of billions of dollars of oil profits in the United States. If they are allowed to start selling oil in euros, they will invest their profits somewhere else and the US economy will suffer tremendously. That is why Bush went to war with all these countries. To maintain America's control over the oil trade.
558	I do not think that it should be a government choice. It should be the property owner's choice. I have yet to be somewhere where smoke bothers me because most places are non-smoking. Bars here in Ohio aren't most anyway. And that doesn't bother me at all. Maybe the next day after smelling my clothes and hair, but my breath probably stinks just as bad after a night of drinking. This is just a way of people controlling and getting money. One of the issues on the ballot says money for the "clean air fund." If they ban smoking, why would you need a clean air fund? I prefer my money to go to my child's college fund. But If this passes, I won't have a choice.
559	If you were supervising your children at all times then you wouldn't need a registry. Also, 90-95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and registries do nothing but provide a false sense of security.
560	In the state of Georgia, a child of 17 years old cannot move out of their parents home without permission. Unless another guardian is appointed or you are adopted. Contact your local juvenile office if you are in doubt. The only reason law enforcement does not enforce this law is because it would cost millions of dollars to do so. Another few months will not hurt if you are truly in love and you can finish school to make a brighter future for the both of you. Then just maybe Mom will be more for the relationship. Good Luck!
561	The first responder is correct. I have never heard of a state putting something like that into law. Instead, it is common courtesy that employers and employees typically offer two weeks notice before terminating. If you want to maintain a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference from them later, it's advisable to give two-weeks notice, but I'd be shocked to hear that it is required.
562	You seem to be looking for something to discriminate against. If you miss your payments, whether you are black, purple, or green, they have the right to discontinue their services to you. It sounds as though they gave you at least a couple of breaks and you chose to not do what is right and that is pay your bills on time. I have the right to say this as I am Native American and proud of it. I do not feel discriminated against because I pay my bills on time.
563	The Sheriff's Department does not sell items, they only allow a party to collect vehicles, not sure about furniture, or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
564	No one objects when criminals are extradited because justice should be served regardless of whether criminals flee. However, accusations are made against innocent people, and not all legal systems are equal. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them who face trial elsewhere want to be convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.
565	Some laws we have may not have been stupid when they were passed, like a law forbidding meat, during periods when cows were ill, and there was no other means to warn people about the dangers of eating that meat. What is stupid is to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful.
566	The Nazis weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin. They were doing what they deemed right. "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions". They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category. They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race. They weren't exactly hating the people. They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions. We view ourselves better, and they as inferior and having no feelings, and no right to live happily. That's what the Nazis did to various people groups. Stalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly, and enforced a "Harvest of Despair". You should watch the documentary below:
567	In my opinion, no. How would that effect the child? When the child is small, it may not be an issue, but when the child enters school, other children may ridicule him or her and cause emotional stress for the child. This would really confuse the child! No matter what anyone says, a child needs a mother and a father.
568	The vast majority of the answers above make the same mistake that the question implies. It is not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. The issue is the Establishment clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reasons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion. It is pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.
569	I think it is a good idea that everyone at school is on the same level, at least in terms of appearance. Additionally, students who are less fortunate and do not have enough money to buy clothes or do not have many clothes do not have to worry about what they will wear. This, in turn, helps their self-esteem and allows them to concentrate more on schoolwork.
570	Any society that values the value of human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.
571	If you are speaking of the government interfering with our right as parents to teach our children, then no.
572	I have always thought that the issue is more about the mascot names rather than the issues of poverty on the reservations, poor schooling, etc.
573	The answer is no. However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information. There are many holdovers from the Clinton era. Newspapers are in the business of badmouthing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort. It is getting people killed and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
574	American law states that you need a document from a government to prove you are married. If you want a lifetime commitment from the person you love the most, just tell her that she is your wife and have a ceremony. Discuss your future and express your love for one another. Remember to continue this thinking every day for the rest of your life.
575	Your client? I am not sure what you are saying. First, your question is not consistent. Second, the racism charges in your question make it highly suspect. Honestly, I am glad that your client is not allowed in the United States, because if he "hired" you, he should not be here.
576	The laws governing the above vary greatly from state to state. For the most accurate information, you should consult an attorney who is licensed in your state.
577	It is boring and kind of scary. I am not going to complain about the regular sex. Shower time could get out of hand. Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you do not necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke. There are many good looking loonies in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it. Each has its pros and cons, but I would recommend psychiatric ward over jail.
578	There are tens of thousands of water companies in the United States. If they are regulated by federal and state agencies, there is no basis for a suit. If you do not like tap water, drill your own well, install your own filtration system or buy bottled water. However, you will not prevail if you attempt to sue a water company unless you prove they are negligent.
579	The same tactic has also been used against private citizens; activists would wait near big public events where they know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
580	The adversarial legal system is governed by rules of conduct and engagement imposed on both parties. In that sense it is ethical as it provides a structure for "fair play". However, a lawyer's job is to win a case for his client. Taking advantage of loopholes in the law is one way to beat the other side. In any event, the legal process that we have provides the best way to redress a wrong since a party that feels its claim was not handled well/fairly within the scope of the law, can in some cases seek further action through the appelate courts. This is as good as it gets, folks! The alternative would be Hamurarbbi's Sheria/Law, where justice is meted out in the form of chopping off body parts.
581	Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this sounds like it goes a little far. Unless your boyfriend has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected. As for the other man, is he really an illegal alien? Then INS could come in and send him back.
582	I almost get angry when I hear someone say this. Granted this is a blanket statement, and doesn't include outside circumstance such as extreme poverty or a disease, but I feel that 90% of the time laziness is to blame. I've heard the "I know stupid people with good grades" argument, and I don't understand that. Even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge. Please change my view!
583	I have slowly been losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd. There is this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it. Yet, we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material. Why should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it? Why should I believe that it's anything more than a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning next to one without the latter, it seems far simpler with less baggage.
584	The government should pay for all of these things because the rich should pay more and the poor less.
585	I used to watch that show with my family, but now I find it to be mostly sexual jokes. I am no longer embarrassed to watch it with them.
586	I am not a'masculinist,' but I think it is unfair that men get lower insurance rates than women.
587	I agree with CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs. Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months. There are enough specialist sources for a deeper critique or explanation to current affairs, and Twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that is particularly salient. I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost, and CNN apps from my phone. I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers?
588	After viewing Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed how much of a bad move this is. Servers are providing a service that does not have to be provided to us. They work hard and they usually only get paid enough to pay for the state and federal taxes applied to the wages. To not tip is a form of disrespect to them. Be brutal, kind, or whatever you want. Just be logical.
589	I do not see the benefit of government recognition of marriage. First, the benefits: no more fights about what marriage is. If you want to get married by your church - you still can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony - you can. Government does not care. Instant equality. Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency.
590	I believe that discrimination against the wealthy is just as morally wrong as any other form of discrimination. America is often referred to as a free society and a land of equality, but if it charges certain people more for being more productive, then America is no longer free and equal. Additionally, additional taxes and discrimination on the productive serve the effect of discouraging this behavior (or encouraging it to happen elsewhere where Americans do not benefit from spillover effects). Additionally, our subsidy system for poor people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the ranks of the poor by millions.
591	I think it is possible that the Palestinians are taking up military strongholds in public compounds such as schools and hospitals, taking hostages (which could help account for the number of civilian casualties), and minimizing their military casualties by allowing the Israelis to destroy these compounds while under the impression that there are more soldiers there. The end result is propaganda against a UN affiliated nation that is "mercilessly committing genocide against a smaller, helpless nation."
592	The smaller the body politic, the more the people are in control. The best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale, but small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). For example, look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly governed China is with 1,351 million. I say the reason is that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the United States into several independent countries, such as: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense deals the way Europe is.
593	Since 1913, people with moustaches have not been seen as trustworthy due to people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Linin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and many more. When the "fingerstache" meme first became popular, I was mortified because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. To me, anybody that throws up a fingerstache might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute. It is a confession of their secret desire to return to barbarism and project their hipster (or should I say Hitler) tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse, America's rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism.
594	I know this is a touchy subject, however, I currently believe that we let these guys off too easy. If you caught someone doing this to your child, would you do the same? Honesty. If someone did this to your child and caught them, what would you do? I chose the age of 30 because I believe the age gap between 30 and 17 is too big. I feel that this should only be done for sexual crimes. I could be wrong, though. I believe castration would be a suitable punishment because you wouldn't really be able to rape a minor with out a penis.
595	If young men are taught that being horny is a sin, having sex with your girlfriend is a sin, raping is a sin, then they will not know the difference between right and wrong.
596	I have been researching this economic doctrine for some time, and I do not understand how in 2014 you can still defend these principles as being ethical or particularly effective. I understand that this was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 1960s ended. However, there is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create multinational monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, create serious economic inequality, erode social good, and continue to perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy have influence. I am genuinely curious if there are any real benefits to this kind of policy, or does it simply concentrate wealth?
597	I already thought it was very likely George W. Bush would go down as the worst president in history, but now that we are seeing Iraq unravel, I am sure of that. Let's review all of his failures: 1. Asleep at the wheel/ignoring all the warnings for 9/11. 2. Completely false/made up pretext for the war in Iraq (WMDs), completely destabilizing the region (as we are seeing now). 3. After starting two wars in the Mideast, engaged in doomed attempt at nation building/bringing democracy in order to enrich the military industrial complex and oil buddies. 4. Asleep at the wheel during the housing/finance bust, presiding over the worst recession since the Great Depression.
598	The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda designed to keep kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings, which is a key reason why there are more school shootings.
599	I have changed my mind.
600	I am in a long-distance relationship where there is pressure to move to where my significant other is living and working. We both have inflexible corporate jobs. I believe although I am past 30 years old and I do love him, I cannot sacrifice my career anymore for a big move. I do not speak the language he speaks (although I am learning it, I speak it at an elementary level). CMV. What beliefs do you hold that can make me move to be with someone I love but which will make me throw away everything in my home country? What else should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?
601	Powermat is being installed in 100,000 locations around the U.S. If the next iPhone has a built in PMA component, then Qi will lose the war. CMV To be clear, I support Qi and I do not like the data transmission (pushed ads) that PMA can do.
602	I think that offsides in soccer should be eliminated. This would allow for more passing, shooting, and generally exciting offensives. This would also cause games to be much higher scoring, which would please the fans. Almost no games would end in a draw, which is the most frustrating thing in any sport.
603	I was a firm believer in UFO's for several years, but I have come to believe that all UFO sightings can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony. Many credible sources of eye-witness testimony, such as the various military personnel in the Disclosure Project, end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money or simply lying about their expertise. I would love for it to be true that aliens have been visiting earth and it is all a coverup.
604	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men of traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible, and protect your family. It is the male equivalent of "be more ladylike." It implies that these particular values are only for men.
605	The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a perpetual flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment, specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God, is the least morally defensible concept I can imagine. All of the worst dictators combined have nothing on the amount of suffering this world-view causes. We are talking about a scale of billions being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions. Nothing all of humanity combined has ever done can ever come close to the scale of this.
606	I admit I am a fan of Daisy. Her voice is irritating, but that is your opinion. However, Super Mario Land was the first Mario game I ever beat, and so I have an affinity for her. Additionally, now that Nintendo has a habit of sending Mario to places outside of the Mushroom Kingdom, such as Galaxy or 3D World, it would make perfect sense to bring him back to Sarassaland. This would allow Peach to be a playable character, it justifies her continued presence in spinoffs, and it could make the Mario universe more cohesive. Please, change my view. Because it is never going to happen, and I do not want to die sad.
607	I have been fascinated by economics and money my entire life. I recall spending a lot of time thinking about what a "perfect" money would have, as I see many flaws with the current "candidates" (e.g. gold/dollars/euros). As a result, I believe market forces will push more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior monies in the market place) until Bitcoin consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency. I have done a lot of FMA on this, and I feel very confident in the conclusion that this is inevitable. I have invested my life's savings in Bitcoin. Do you change your mind?
608	I believe that Bill Nye is a more prominent figure among the younger generation and has all the skills and knowledge required to create a truly amazing experience while watching the Cosmos series. I am not saying that Neil deGrasse Tyson did a bad job, but I simply believe that it would be more fitting and symbolic to have Bill Nye, who has been fighting so long for knowledge, as the narrator and tour guide of the Cosmos series, which will inspire the next generation of thinkers.
609	I am studying at university and getting good grades. However, my friends are getting 2:1s and 2:2s. It has become an expectation that I achieve Firsts, and therefore when I do score highly on work I receive replies such as "of course" or "is that it?" jokingly from my peers. I am not trying to be arrogant, but I cannot talk about this with any of the guys on the course. They feel like I should be 'grateful' for my grades, despite the fact I put substantially more planning and writing time into the work I submit. In the past I have usually had a peer to compete with, but I am lacking that, and I feel it puts pressure on me to just keep at the top.
610	I recently completed a marathon of the series, and I believe the first three episodes were more enjoyable. The story was quite rich, the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, and the role of the Jedi. There were some amazing set pieces, as well, such as Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs. Obi Wan, and Jango Fett. I also accept there are faults with the first three episodes, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes were more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three.
611	Metal is evil for several reasons. First, the symbolism it contains can be interpreted as evil even by a fifth grader. Second, the lifestyles of its artists. Most of them live very sinful and evil lifestyles. Is this because of the genre? I believe it is.
612	I agree that the president should be impeached. While George W. Bush is not currently the worst, he is among the worst, and we must find someone more competent with the politics and world affairs of the United States of America. With that, let us vote PRO to impeach Bush.
613	The last military practice for NKR was to shoot a missile over Japan. I wonder what they were practicing for.
614	People will always have their opinions about religion, no matter what. Because, they were raised that way.
615	I agree. What practical benefit is there in knowing whether or not there was life on Mars? Other than curiosity, what could we hope to gain? The world is experiencing war, starvation, and job loss. We should focus on fixing what is wrong here on Earth before we go chasing the curios of the universe.
616	The world will not end. NASA will continue to look for asteroids. I think it was 3,000 years ago. I made a bet with my friend that if the world does not end in 2012 I will get $5. If it does he gets $5. I cannot wait to collect my $5.
617	I agree, although within reason. Physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of disciplining has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (i.e. alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.
618	My friend is moving to Texas, a place where there are 13% whites, and the town is mostly gang territory. She is leaving everything behind, including family and friends, and most people tell her to stay. What do you think?
619	TJ was smarter than Sheldon because he had an IQ of 180 when he was 10. He skipped grade 4 and went straight to grade 10. He was able to teach the grade 10 class and had arguments with teachers, but he was always right. He was able to hack into numerous things. He was even on a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with grown adults that were very smart, perhaps as smart as Sheldon.
620	I prefer calendars that start with Sunday because it is more appealing (symmetry), but regardless, the week starts on Monday.
621	I had a horrible experience and will never go back.
622	I cannot believe I did not write a review for this place. It is located inside Planet Hollywood and is open 24 hours. Great place to go when you have the munchies while your watching a movie. My recommendations are the Full Montagu, which is beef and turkey and is very tasty, or the Holiday Turkey which is very good if you like turkey. The Original is beef sandwich which was nothing special. All sandwiches are under $7, so do not let the long line scare you away.
623	This place's idea about individual portions is awesome. There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets. Service was nice, although it became a bit of a "Where's Waldo" when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. The New York Steak was really good and I enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner, as we came during brunch!
624	Raising Cane's is a good choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. Additionally, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw with your meal. The staff is pleasant and fast. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.
625	I live nearby and was recommended this place by some Arsenal workers. The food is made from scratch and is very good. The place is never busy and you can enjoy your meal while looking out the windows at Penn Avenue.
626	We have gone twice and will not return. The first time the food was acceptable but the steaks were overcooked. The second time the food took 20 minutes to arrive and the vegetables were soggy and the lobster was rubbery. My son, who normally eats anything, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. We finally went up front to pay and the woman asked how our experience was. She said, "sorry, $34.24". We should have just walked out. I would not have felt guilty.
627	The pizza was ok, the price was $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay, they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card. Then, you are asked if you want to leave a tip. I would think that for take out orders, they would not ask for a tip at all. They did not have any menus, you had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. The pizza took 28 minutes, which was longer than they said it would take. This is a new place, and their sanitation score was a 97.5.
628	Students should be allowed to express themselves. The uniform is boring.
629	I think they are bad because you should be free without anybody telling you what to do.
630	The school district my cousin's three children attend has implemented school uniforms, with the stated purpose of reducing bullying. However, this only addresses the issue of students being bullied because they are not wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the "in thing." Additionally, it infringes upon students' basic right to be individuals and to express their individuality.
631	Students have the right way to feel and express themselves, but it's wrong. Learning is what makes us smart.
632	When you are outside of college, high school, or whatever, you have to choose your own clothing.
633	I find that whatever works for one person is good for another. Therefore, I am voting for Firefox because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definitely superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the 7 update.
634	Since when is Firefox an Apple fad? There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one. If you are "original and free minded" then why do you use the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else does "original"? I won't rebut your second paragraph, as it doesn't contain a single fact and isn't even an argument at all.
635	I would not turn my wife in because I love her and we married for a reason. I would trust my wife if she killed someone for a good reason, although murder is still murder. Gene Hackman killed the man that her wife was cheating on.
636	I would definitely stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad, but I would consider that some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. That is a difficult question. If I truly loved this person, I would not turn them in. I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help through thick and thin till death do us part.
637	Books are better than TV because TV can make you blind, and your eyes can hurt a lot if you watch it too much.
638	Books are better than TV because kids watch TV with bad influences. Most parents do not care what their children watch. I thank books are better because you learn more from books.
639	I am a class 11 student. I need to take part in a debate, so please give me more information. I will be very grateful.
640	The increasing population means less land, and less land means a big crowd everywhere. India is able to win gold medals in corrosion, terrorism, illeteracy, and violence.
641	I think if I had a father that did nothing for me, I would not want him around. Chances are you will not talk to him in five years. Why try to make it work if you already know the outcome?
642	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a bad father because sometimes they get on your last nerve and they make you do things you don't want to do. But that is the way fathers are. You still have other people to look up to even though your dad is not around. I am used to being alone with my mom without my dad there, so I really don't have a favorite side.
643	I think it is better if you are fatherless than a bad father. Your bad father will give you bad influence. Maybe you might follow your father as he is. But if you are a fatherless, it will be alright. As long as you are a bad father or a fatherless, they can encourage you to succeed in life and also help you correct your mistakes that you had made.
644	I would support the fact that being fatherless is better than having a bad father. Fathers are typically supposed to provide for the household and solve problems that arise. They are the "alpha male" in the household. If you are not a good father, then why should you be around? Kids look to their fathers as an example of how to be a man and take responsibility for their actions. So why not be fatherless when having a bad father is the same thing?
645	As a young man, it is important that you have someone in your life who supports you and pushes you to be successful in life.
646	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it would be orderly, elegant, rational, and modern. However, while he was gone, Farquhar developed Singapore poorly, causing Raffles to feel dissappointed.
647	Although Farquhar was said to be the one who stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, the strategizing, and was the one to select Singapore as another British base. If William Farquhar was to be proclaimed the founder because he did the "grunt work", then perhaps the supervisor of a construction site should get the most commission, instead of the contractor? Besides, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors, and he did not leave of free will.
648	Raffles was the one to sign the treaty with the Temenggong and Sultan Hussien. William Farquhar was the one to remain in Singapore and develop it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen. In addition, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's development, so he should be considered a founder.
649	Raffles Institution, which is now known as Raffles Institution, was established in 1837.
650	Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan included separate areas for different ethnic groups and provided other facilities such as roads, schools, and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was formed by Raffles to oversee the project.
651	Raffles found Farquhar had done a poor job of raising the city of Singapore. He introduced opium sales into Singapore in order to raise more money for Singapore.
652	If you lived in the olden days, you would be surprised if you did not catch a disease everyday. Hospitals were one thing Raffles built that would have saved many people in those times because living conditions were bad. Another reason he helped in the development of hospitals.
653	It is wrong, unhealthy, and addictive, but so is smoking cigarettes. Just because it is wrong, does not mean it should not exist.
654	Pornography is disgusting. It exploits men and women. It is unrealistic and can split up relationships. If a man and woman are in a relationship, they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. This is out of love and respect.
655	Okay, I believe that "God" created and then modified through evolution. We will all find out within 100 years.
656	That is an excellent argument about peppered moths. I am very familiar with it, but I am not sure how it proves the evolution process. Both moth colors have always been there, it is just a matter of which is easier for their prey to see.
657	Evolution is as unlikely as a tornado putting together a 747 Airplane.
658	I am not an IE user but FFX has many issues. First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 year old computer it takes about 10 seconds to start it. Secondly, plug-ins I frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player do not perform well in FFX. Third, Firefox is still young. I would guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.
659	I am writing this through Firefox. Unfortunately, Firefox does not have ActiveX support, which makes it unusable for Windows Virtual Earth.
660	Chorme is the best because it is fast and safe. It is also open source, like Firefox.
661	Although Raffles did most of the planning, Farquhar made some plans of his own since Raffles had to leave for Bencoolen. This meant that Farquhar had to plan on his own.
662	Farquhar was the one that contributed more to Singapore than Raffles did, proving that he was the founder of Singapore.
663	I am going to take the Obama approach to this. Abortion is never something a woman would take lightly. There will always be a lot of thinking, asking for help, and even praying involved in making that decision. The pro-life people just do not seem to understand that we also think abortion is a sad and awful thing. Therefore, this decision should be left to the women, not some man miles away in D.C. that has never faced it.
664	If a woman is raped and then left with the child of the man who raped her, then she should be allowed to decide whether or not to have the child. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one of them.
665	While I am personally against abortion, I believe in the right of choice. It does not matter what my opinion or that of the majority is, as long as a pregnant woman decides what to do with her child.
666	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. In other parts of the world, people will do whatever they want.
667	How can that be? How were you raised? Did you go to church? Sunday school? Pray before meals? Pray at school? At night? I remember at the age of seven questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. It didn't make sense, so I stopped assuming God was real, and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (luckily my public school system stopped that practice). Please tell me where I have been brainwashed.
668	There is no concrete evidence that supports the existence of God. Religion and the Bible have so many contradictions and inconsistencies that I am becoming less and less convinced in their existence. Evolution makes more sense to me. Animals adapt to their environment and over huge amounts of time will evolve to be able to survive in different climates and situations.
669	I believe the common good is a better endeavor because it is better to give than to receive. It is better to reach out in help rather than holding your own hand.
670	I would like to see a society where people are more civil, and where people are able to pursue their dreams without the assistance of others.
671	Advancing the common good is better for me because if I were to pursue my own personal pursuits, they wouldn't be all that great because they would be selfish choices that would end up hurting someone else. I don't like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else's well-being before we thought about ourselves.
672	There is less competition for wearing the most fashionable clothing, so student victimization is likely to be decreased. Additionally, fights and gang activity should be decreased.
673	Yes, school uniforms are important. They are a logo for our school, and they remind us that we are part of the school. If we do not wear our uniforms, the teacher will give us a punishment, and from that we can learn to be disciplined students. If we go out of school, the teacher will see that we have our school uniform on, and people will know that we are from that school.
674	It would be better to have a bad father than not have one at all. If you were to grow up without one, you would always have an empty void in your life. If your father is bad, it could cause you to strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because your father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is bad, but I am still happy I know who he is. Just so I cant imagine wondering about it.
675	I believe it is better to have a bad father than be fatherless. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong. But, as long as you have a father, no matter how bad he is, at least you have somebody there to support your decisions and encourage you.
676	I think it is better to have a lousy father than none at all. A father just being in the child's life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure. Mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way.
677	Bottled water is not subject to the same regulations as tap water, so you are not sure of what you are drinking when you drink bottled water.
678	I feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed unless in an emergency. Plastic bottles can leach chemicals after a time, and they end up in landfills. Furthermore, they take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the water bottle itself. Additionally, nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria.
679	Over 1.5 million barrels of oil were used to make the plastic bottles consumed in the US last year. That does not include the petroleum used to transport them. That is enough petroleum to power 100,000 automobiles for a year.
680	The transportation of bottled water from western Europe into New York City alone released an estimated 3,800 tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere. Additionally, in California, 18 million gallons of bottled water were shipped in from Fiji in 2006, releasing an estimated 2,500 tons of global warming pollution.
681	If you do not save bottled water for an emergency, you are thinking about the present. You are drinking bottled water when you do not need to.
682	Nowadays, no one can live without television. It is commonplace to watch television. Television is better than books. Everyone votes for television.
683	Television is important for communication. This is to cross the character limit.
684	It is a source of entertainment and helps people who are unable to read.
685	While water companies do their best to recycle, they still have a responsibility to reduce waste.
686	Marriage is a personal matter between a man and woman, and should not be decided by politicians.
687	Homosexual people are making a terrible mistake. They are living life right now without having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage, life would be much better.
688	We have the potential to do great things. The only competition we have is China, who has done a better job in the long run. However, the way India operates, it always makes order out of chaos.
689	Why do you think we cannot stand that question? Also, you forgot all the other choices. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism and more.
690	Christianity believes in rape, genocide, hell fire, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc. Atheism rejects these claims based on logic, observation, and common sense.
691	I am pointing out that believing in God is called "faith", and we do not need proof to deal with these atheists. The idea of God being false is your own words, and I do not have to deal with this. Whatever you think is your faith, we will not stop you.
692	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church. I was lucky to encounter a church full of people who were kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still believes in the beliefs and teachings of Christians. I believe in God, not religion.
693	I am a Christian because I believe that God will judge all people for their good and bad deeds.
694	I am not a Christian, but if you are, you really cannot argue with them unless your argument is based on the same subject.
695	If God does not exist, then how come there are many predictions written thousands of years before Jesus that say exactly what happened to Jesus.
696	It must not be mandatory, but it must be required. Also, separate boys from girls if possible. Assign physical education activities to boys and the same to girls.
697	If people want to be together, that is their choice. If you do not like what they do, then do not be their friend. Also, what will you do when your children are gay?
698	I did not even have to go to the sites to know that #2,#3, and #5 on your list are from right wing/conservative groups that are extremely biased.
699	The United States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion over another is the bane of freedom. Leviticus 20:13 states, "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands." There is a loving God, huh?
700	I would say most people in Britain would say it is wrong, however, I think anybody should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love. Because how come we can get married to the other sexuality, but a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman, and a woman as gay. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like.
701	I believe that personal pursuit is better because I think that helping yourself before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do, everything comes back to you. You do not want your life to be out of balance while helping others.
702	I believe that a personal pursuit is more important than others'. However, I am unsure. If someone in your family is in need, you will do anything to help that family member. I believe that helping someone in your family is something you do no matter what. If someone in your family is in need, you will help that family member instead of a random person you do not know.
703	You should not discuss your home life with them unless you have a very good reason. If you could find a job within walking distance, that would be reasonable. I put up with a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home. I still recommend staying at home as long as you can. If your home life is the problem, get Social Services involved.
704	Since he knew about it, did not petition the court at that time, and let a lot of time pass, the court will most likely view this as allowing it. However, he will have to petition the court to find her in contempt, and order her to return to the state. A much better chance had he done it prior to her moving, or as soon as she moved.
705	The deal is that freedom of speech goes both ways. People have a right to say what they want, but others have a right to object, argue, and even ask for an apology. A liberal says something, a conservative objects, and the conservative is criticized for violating a person's freedom of speech. A conservative says something, a conservative objects, and the conservative either let it drop, or defends the original statement on its merits. Who is really against freedom of speech; the conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact you are offended by a statement?
706	Americans as a whole do not think that way. There is much controversy in our country about this issue. It is currently legal in most states to have an abortion, but conservative religious zealots are always trying to change the law. Obviously, I am pro-women's rights.
707	Capital punishment is the most efficient law enforcement method available. Ask any country that has used it and you will find that their crime rates are much lower than the USA's. However, it is immoral for a man to take another's life no matter what the situation since you are assuming a position of superiority when you do so and every man on earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice. It is simply a matter of perspective. The typical Christian perspective goes against capital punishment and that is due to this Christian country. The simple truth is that it is effective but at the same time, from a biased perspective, it is barbaric, immoral, and there are better, though not as effective, solutions.
708	The dismissal does not mean that the case has been decided, but it does leave the possibility that the company may try to collect the debt or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies. You should ask an attorney to help you with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. You should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change. In this manner you protect your interests - and, if the company is foolish enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a profit.
709	To answer your question and to refute the person who compared capital punishment to abortion: the fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death and later found to be innocent. However, generally, if a person has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money? If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live? Additionally, I believe there should be WITHOUT A DOUBT concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row. As for abortion, unborn children have not committed heinous crimes.
710	I believe that every pool in Ohio should have a fence. The risk is not worth the reward, and I would install one no matter what the law is. Also, if you do not have a fence around it, you might have problems with your homeowners insurance.
711	This is a great question. The law states that you cannot discriminate based on sex, color, or age. However, white men are the only group that is not protected. This seems odd, but how often do we need protection?
712	Technically IC Systems is liable, but you would probably have to go to small claims court to force them to pay. My advice is to change your bank account number right away so they cannot use it any time they like. Then set up other payment arrangements with them. While you're doing that, you should tell them you are reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you. Put that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left. Then stop paying. If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
713	We already have this, it is called the Social Security Card. Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information of a given social security number. However, our government has made it so difficult to do this that most employers will not take the time.
714	I have not followed this political case closely, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation. That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.
715	That is exactly why we need those freedoms. We need to be able to say, "I do not like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prison. I may not agree with someone else's opinions, but I will fight to the death to make sure they can state those opinions.
716	The United States of America is in a mess because of the ungrateful American public who forget how our country was free.
717	If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change or modify. However, that is a very tiring and exhaustive process.
718	I agree with you that pets suffer every year due to the fact that the main displays start earlier. The first big display I'm aware of was a few weeks ago in the middle of October. What happened to November 5th? If it was only for one night, it wouldn't be so bad.
719	Thank you for bringing up this important issue. Most of the things you mentioned have beneficial uses. The danger is if they are misused. I think the Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined. They are talking of retaining prisoners in Cuba for the rest of their lives, without charges or benefit of legal defense. The only way to protect our rights is to participate in the process of government. I hope anyone who reads this is ready to defend liberty with their vote on the 7th.
720	Half the schools in the US think yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights, and the rights of others. I would expect that the civil war would be mentioned before sixth grade. The rest would follow, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. (Ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. No wonder why half the youth is lost and confused.
721	In the realm of ethics, you should be notified of any medications taken by the child. However, legally, if this juvenile center is treating your child for any sort of mental illness, they do not have to notify you if he or she is older than 12. Additionally, since the child is a ward of the state due to his or her incarceration, the state does not have to notify you of any new charges or pending charges.
722	I have never been a server or a waitress, but I feel that they should be paid minimum wage, no matter how much in tips they receive. They work just as hard as anyone else.
723	I agree with you that if a person wishes to say the Pledge, they should be allowed to do so. No one is forcing others to join in and pledge -- they are perfectly within their rights to abstain. I get really annoyed when people try to claim that just "hearing" the pledge violates their rights. Well, what about my right to assert myself and my allegiance to my country? I would think that would trump anything else.
724	I disagree, in the first instance because this places a price on human life and dignity; life can be given, it should not be sold. Additionally, this is usually a short-term decision that can be deeply regretted if one lives long enough. For example, one can sell only organs that they can live without, such as kidneys or eyes. However, what if, later in life, their remaining organ fails, and they do not have the money to replace it? They are in a worse position, possibly dead if it was a kidney.
725	I am sure he is not the first student to think of this. It is a given that you are taking a test to show what you have learned. Obviously he has learned nothing! That would be like getting surgery on your heart and after the doctor says, "oh you wanted it done correctly? Well, you didn't say that". Tell him to take the energy he is scheming with to STUDY!
726	If the daughter was 19 years old and competent at the time, then all records are hers. Depending on how much time has passed, the document holders could be charged with theft. If years have passed, and the daughter has not made previous attempts to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders. You need a lawyer involved.
727	Many people have been convinced, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house. That is for the lucky ones, however. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
728	The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process. The person asking the questions has his bias; a person who wrote the question has her bias; a person who is answering the question has her bias. The first two forms of bias should ideally not show up in the results of an ethically conducted poll, however they often do. The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both. Sometimes small and/or homogeneous samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll.
729	I am satisfied that my involvement in the lives of these people will have made a difference, and that they are better off having known me than they would have been otherwise.
730	It is biased, but what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet subject search records of Americans to the government under the guise of cracking down on porn? From what I have heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda. It was dumb to pose that question. It is a crime to threaten the President, and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way, especially by this president. I have noticed that they have let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then they are fine with it. I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
731	Have you been standing out in the hot sun for too long? Believe it or not, the rich people do pay lots of other people's taxes for them. The rest of your rambling sounds rather socialist. Are you insinuating liberals are emulating socialists? I never, in a million years, would have thought THAT.
732	The president can declare anyone, not just foreigners, a "person who might be aiding terrorists", and then hold them indefinitely at an undisclosed location. This has completely negated habeas corpus. The president is not required to explain to a court why he believes someone has aided terrorists, so he could literally choose anyone, and no-one, not even the Supreme Court could require him to produce that person ever again. This happens in Fascist dictatorships.
733	Is it "unfair dismissal"? In most states, employment is at-will, so an employer can fire an employee at any time for any reason or no reason at all. However, there are restrictions. For example, employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability). They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states. SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a "Contigency" so you do not have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case. Contact your local bar association for a reference.
734	I heard that in Australia and the United States, two countries that use ID cards, there is a higher rate of identity theft. This is because all someone would need to steal your identity is one card, rather than having to go through a mountain of bills to get all your details. I think this is a bad idea. Perhaps if they introduced them and someone stole the identity of the Prime Minister, then they would see how silly the idea is.
735	I agree with your opening statement: "All Rise." Additionally, I do not trust "god" due to the fact that God never talks to anyone except the leaders. This leads me to believe that leaders often claim to be told by God. For example, whenever someone attacks another, in the last 16 centuries, they claim that God ordered them to do that.
736	I am a fair trade capitalist who is extremist right. I hate Marxism and believe that the solution to our problems is found in the Bible. Public education is a waste of money due to low literacy and a lack of basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day. I am not worried about it. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change. We have always had storms and will always have wars. Because man is basically selfish.
737	I agree with you, unless the person can't due to a medical reason, etc., but other than that, yes. Show respect for our country! Our brave soldiers are willing to go fight for America and risk their lives, and some people here aren't bothered to take a moment to stand in front of the flag. I think it is wrong. I will proudly stand for my country and do everything I can to support it.
738	Last time I checked, he still has the right to a court appointment attorney. Until then, if you cannot make bail or get a bondsman, then I guess he will have to tough it until his court date. If he hates it that bad, then maybe he won't make the same mistake again when choosing a girl.
739	I do not believe that there is a genetic component to being homosexual. Rather, I believe that people make up their minds about being homosexual and then believe that they have been homosexual since birth.
740	Mergers of large companies are carefully analyzed before being approved, so as not to distort competition by creating a single company with too much power. However, the purchase of smaller companies by large companies is not considered problematic, even if the value of the small company is huge. For example, the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook a large amount of personal information, which is Facebook's main business model, putting it in a leading position to sell this data. Furthermore, I feel that my right to be informed has been violated, the moment Facebook gained the right to do as it wishes with my data without my consent and without giving me an option to opt out and delete the data. Just because I trusted company A with my data does not give company B, the buyer, my trust.
741	I live near a large navy base and the community idolizes the military. I do not believe that members of the Military are anything special and I do not think they should be treated as such.
742	I own an AK-47 with a ten round magazine and a.40 caliber Springfield Armory handgun that holds twelve rounds. In my opinion, someone can take out just as many people with a handgun as they would with an "assault rifle." In my opinion, handguns are more dangerous because they are easily concealed.
743	I am arguing that it is fine to experience no emotion when watching an animal die senselessly.
744	The CMV (checks) is a paper check that can be used to transfer money from one checking account to another. However, today's technology (debit cards) makes the need for paper checks disappear.
745	Since men have suffered the most from the recession, they are also the least likely to recover. Consequently, women are being given incentives to enter college and fields that men are not. There are many secure jobs, such as teaching and nursing, that are 90% female. Given the higher male unemployment, I think anyone offering a female-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male-specific scholarship to a female-dominated field. Please CMV.
746	In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all it is about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I do not know how anybody can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How is that entertaining? I'd rather watch a cricket game. The drivers don't even have to be in shape, as long as they do not have high blood pressure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
747	In both of these events a country lost territory which rightfully belonged to its people. In both cases, an authority felt the need to land-grab, one secured their military base, and the other "wanted their holy land back." This naturally leads to deaths. Yet, because of superpowers involved it's common to make this an issue about taking sides with either the US or Russia, when the countries essentially did the same thing.
748	The actual leaders of bailed-out firms should be killed by lethal injection, not figureheads or sacrificial lambs. It should not be too hard to figure out who called the shots, even if they've since quit. The moral hazard created by bailouts is that business leaders get to keep the profits while the costs of a crash are borne by the public. That encourages them to take big risks at our expense. Adding the personal risk of death should correct this problem. This would also help balance out inequity in the application of the law. Right now the sword of justice comes down on the poor more than the rich. I don't like the death penalty in general because I don't think it works as a deterrent; people who commit foolish crimes aren't foresightful enough to be thinking about the consequences. But corporate leaders probably ARE. They will think twice before sinking the airship and bailing out with a golden parachute, because they will land on Lady Liberty's sword.
749	There are hundreds of states on the planet and all of them engage extensively in initiating aggression against the individuals they control. Sometimes this aggression is in response to violence initiated by individuals and can be justified. For example, imprisoning a murderer. However, most of the time, it is the state that initiates the aggression. We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example, we say "drafted" when we could say "slave soldier." Or, "drug confiscation" when we could say "theft of herbs." These euphemisms muddie the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations. One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence, and it will be as incomprehensible to them as the Spanish Inquisition is to us.
750	I believe that government is good and taxes are a natural cost of having a good government. However, high taxes do not necessarily mean a good government. In fact, I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails. What am I missing?
751	It is quite simple. Men who are wealthy and famous, nevermind if they are also younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They do not even need any game to get sex. It is too easy. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. This may be a bad CMV. Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. It is more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you. For this reason, I believe that women such as Tiger Woods' ex-wife were delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.
752	I am asserting that the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices. First of all, they are racist. They abuse and mistreat those different from them. This makes them evil by today's morales and paints them as the villains. Secondly, Ulfric used Thu'um to kill the high king. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys. They have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head off at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just cartoon villains.
753	I believe the word they are looking for is hip hop / youth culture that is not just reserved for blacks. While the whole culture itself is not bad, there are many parts that have spewed from this culture that are bad for society.
754	Christian A is against the idea of carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life in all discovered and undiscovered universes, and much more. Christian B is in agreement with the idea that the concept of God as portrayed in the bible is archaic and incompatible with the 21st century, but still follows good Christian values and believes in a higher being. Christian A does not deserve to be taken seriously.
755	I used to be a member of the /r/NoFap community and felt pride when a day passed without masturbation. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbation and each time I masturbated I felt dread and depression knowing that I would just masturbate again. Today I broke my 4 day streak and I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It is bad for you. You could change my view with study or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view.
756	We are all capable of the horrendous acts that Hitler committed or fostered in his life. The right circumstances and societal influences could bring out the same in each of us. I am not a supporter of any of the atrocities he engaged in. However, there is historical perspective that could perhaps explain some of his attitudes. The entire concept of eugenics fed right into his Aryan superiority complex. And war is war. People can justify all kinds of horrible things when in that mode. Again, I am thoroughly disgusted by what he did, but I do not discount the possibility that I am capable of horrible things myself if I do not keep a focus on continually learning, growing, and evolving in a compassionate and empathetic manner.
757	I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences art does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self.
758	There are many men and women who are highly intelligent. In the end, all of the highly intelligent individuals from each sex cancel out each other's weaknesses, making them of equal intelligence.
759	However, creature comforts and political freedom are still attractive features to non-Americans. As a result, we gain valuable brainpower from countries like India and China every day. While we have our own societal ills, the US is still at the forefront of innovation. China, India, and even much of Europe can only replicate our inventions, follow in our research, and imitate our military strength.
760	We have residues of our ancestors, shiver and get reptilian like behavior, our hair stands on its end when frightened, and we all have tail bones. I am not an atheist, I believe in God. I simply believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen, including that what was created would evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve. It is all part of the Master's plan. I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution, and neither do a growing number of progressive believers of God of various denominations.
761	The use of oil has long since been outlived. Plastic is a good material for many uses, and all plastic is recyclable. Battery technology has existed for nearly ten years that can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge, which is more than many gas-run vehicles on the road today. Using oil damages the environment, causes numerous diseases, and is the primary cause of global warming.
762	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support locking an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course, nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people because, in general, animals are viewed as inferior which justifies locking them up. I do not like zoos.
763	I do not think such a thing should be enforced by law. In certain cases it is necessary to have privacy on the web. However, if you have nothing to hide or are not reconnaissing, then there is no need to hide your identity. Is it annoying when people, for example, post slander online attacking others but hide their identity? To me, it is.
764	As of right now, pride has more talent than ufc. Pride has fighters from all over the world, where ufc is limited to North America.
765	I do not listen to rock and roll music for its deep meanings. I listen to rock and roll music to enjoy it.
766	Mankind is dependent on machines for survival. This is seen in hospitals where respirators, kidney dialysis machines, and defibrillators are used to keep people alive when they are near death. Additionally, handphone, cars, mp3 players, and the infamous PSP are used by many children, teenagers, and adults.
767	I do not want to earn my living this way, but, what right do I have to judge what someone else does with their life? I have enough trouble keeping track of myself. Life has a way of changing the way you look at it.
768	I would argue that people are generally good. That does not mean that all people are good all the time, or even that all people are basically good. We are all human, and prone to make bad choices. However, people are generally good at one time or another.
769	Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis. Let's assume that he has admitted that the economy is not his strong suit. I let him slide on that too. What stops him from giving up just a few hours for one evening to be part of a debate that is very important to his election chances? Because of that I feel McCain is running scared which is hurting his chances. He's demonstrating that when it come to crunch time, he'll bail and look for something else to do.
770	Yes, it is. There are several times "no" is the correct answer though; dictatorships have called themselves a republic. In fact, are Republicans and Democrats the same? In both forms, the people vote for the person/persons they want to "rule" them. The people choose those who agree with them. The only difference is the different countries' way to do it. For example, Denmark uses the way where the people (18+) vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc. USA chooses 1 president.
771	I ask, if the gay community can get their rights taken away, then who will?
772	Although it is not technically correct (Web 2.0 is not a new technical iteration of the WWW), the mass adoption of a technology requires two important things: 1) A technology that works and 2) A hook that the audience and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will be able to relate to. I know it is a flimsy argument and it will irritate a lot of people, including me, if it happens. However, it is a name that works better than Semantic Web - SW is not the kind of name you see on cereal boxes.
773	I play guitar and I do not feel that I am not good at it. I believe that I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. I love Guitar Hero. It actually helps to improve dexterity, coordination, as well as strength and speed.
774	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus. For example, many men consider lesbians to be sexy because there is no male in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. Similarly, gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor. Romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a woman's level. Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
775	Victor Frankl, a psychiatrist, was a prisoner in a concentration camp during World War II. He said that he felt free because he could choose whether to go insane or remain calm. Not only did he feel free, but he was free because freedom is choice. Choice has consequences. For example, if I decide to steal a bank tomorrow, I will go to jail.
776	I think GRAW on the 360 is the best military multi player game on the system. The graphics are fantastic and obviously more realistic, the gameplay is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing field to novices alongside more experienced players, the interface has been designed with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc. GOW was simply over hyped and doesn't present the same replay value to me that GRAW does.
777	I would not recommend this place, even though it was cheaper than other burrito places. I ordered a grilled veggie burrito with a lot of hot sauce. The hot sauce did not help, and the fillings were very bland.
778	My wife and I love this place, but we are not enjoying the new chips.
779	My husband, who is from the United States, has had his fair share of NY deli meats, including pastrami and corned beef. I was nervous about bringing him here since, in my opinion, their smoked meat is the best. He tried it and loved it! So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal. Do not let the long lines ruin your experience!
780	I was not impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain. I was looking for a place to stop in Madison while on a business trip and found this place. The tapioca pearls were great and clearly fresh, so that was good. I got a mango fruit tea which was too sweet and warm. The kid who helped me didn't seem to be very excited to be there or particularly helpful for a first-timer like me. I was a little disappointed to get a regular lid instead of the fun shrink wrapped cup to stab the straw into like I find at most bubble tea shops.
781	The burgers were good but the price was high. I would give it four stars if it wasn't for the price but I wouldn't go back because of that.
782	K O'Donnells is the place to be when it comes to food. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have an award-winning doggy patio where you can bring your dog and socialize with other dogs. They have happy hour from 3-7.
783	I am a frequent customer at this Chipotle. It is close to my house and can get busy during lunchtime. The staff is very friendly and will ask you about your day. I usually get a burrito and a bowl of soup. I also get half chicken and half steak so I get the best of both worlds for one price. Love having a healthy quick option to go eat lunch or dinner. One thing I do not like is that it is always super cold in here. So bring a jacket.
784	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy, so we assumed it was because of that. The buffet and restaurant itself was very nice and clean, but the food was average. For the $70+ price tag, we will try another place.
785	Because your own clothes are cool. And if you get to wear what you want, it's cool.
786	Firefox is a very good browser. It has many great features and is very secure.
787	I use Linux and thank God there is not an IE version for Linux. Firefox is open, you can do anything with that and no one will process you about that. Oh yeah, and it is safe, cute, has addons, easy install, patches are released in less time, etc.
788	Who said anything about Firefox and Microsoft having anything to do with Steve Jobs and Apple? They are separate entities. IE is terrible at making pages and trying to get things to look right. FF sticks to the World Wide Web Consortium's standards much closer than IE ever did or will.
789	If my wife confided in me, I would not betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her, and I would. I would be very angry, and possibly divorce her, depending on the type of murder.
790	India will not lead the world due to the gap between the rich and poor, as well as their continued belief in the caste system.
791	This is not logical. No country should lead the world. We all started together and that is how it should end. Everyone has their own way. This is not possible.
792	I hope you will consider my views and reply me soon.
793	I would rather be fatherless than have a bad father. I would want a good role model to look up to, and not someone who is never there.
794	Being fatherless would ensure that your only heartaches are his absence and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and then walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. In my opinion, having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence, because either way he knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
795	I would like to point out that Raffles had all the important qualities of a founder and he was in a good position to do so. He invested a lot, therefore we credit him as our founder! We say Obama is the "founder" of health reform because he was in such a high position and he could do something like invest money, time, and effort in such a project.
796	Some may say that raffles left Singapore for a few years and left Farquhar in charge. Therefore, he neglected us. Another example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time, would you say he is no longer our prime Minister? Would you say he is neglecting Singapore? He has a life!
797	Pornography is wrong, unless it has attractive lesbians in it. In fact, I am downloading pornography at the moment.
798	Pornography is morally wrong. If people watch it, they will want to have free sex. Free sex will bring disease, especially HIV.
799	It depends on your beliefs. For example, I am Christian, and I believe it is, but it may be completely acceptable to someone else who is not.
800	The focus should not be on how we got here, but why we are here.
801	If evolution is real, then find me someone or something that is halfway.
802	No, Internet Explorer was not invented before Firefox.
803	Personally, I believe Google Chrome is terrible, but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
804	Most government sites in India are designed only for Internet Explorer. Therefore, it is important to have Internet Explorer on your computer.
805	Physical education teaches kids that it doesn't matter if you are a nerd or a jock, because they are all in the same class doing the same thing. From my personal experience, sometimes there is a jock underneath the nerd outside.
806	The answer is so obvious: teachers should let everyone exercise so they can strengthen their muscles, become thinner, and more flexible, instead of fatter and more lax, so they will not get bullied as much.
807	Physical education should be mandatory because 112,000 people have died in the year 2011 so far due to a lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese.
808	I believe physical education classes should be mandatory in school to help with obesity.
809	Today, many students are playing computer games after school ends. This can lead to poor health, including cancer, due to electromagnetic waves.
810	Real Physical Education lessons provide opportunities for people to realize what they are capable of doing, which in turn will strengthen their self-esteem and lead to them being productive in their society
811	I think it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development was unjustly sent off like that.
812	The right to abortion should not be abused, however, I do believe that the choice should be provided. No one should make decisions about what an individual should do with her body.
813	It is the woman's choice. You cannot control her. (Anyway, how do you know she would not kill herself in attempt to kill her baby as well?)
814	If a woman cannot support a child emotionally, physically, or financially, she should have the right to choose to give up that child.
815	It depends on the situation. If a girl is raped, it is not fair that she must keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that is her fault for not being prepared.
816	Ironic that pro-lifers want live children so they can grow up to be dead soldiers. Women are people, too, and it should be their choice what they bring into the world.
817	It is simple, how would we be able to adapt to different environments? Over time, we adapted to what suited us best. Otherwise, why are we not all the same skin color, why are there so many different types of animals?
818	I enjoy pornography, masturbation is always enjoyable.
819	Yes, women are degraded by pornography, but if it has already happened, why shouldn't we watch it? We can't stop something that has already happened, so let's just go for it!
820	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.
821	I am in the middle. While helping people is good, sometimes you need to help yourself succeed.
822	Personally, I think that personal pursuit is better. There is no reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if I look out for myself instead of the world. If I focus on my goals, then one day I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about, which in turn will help me even more.
823	Frankly, if kids did not dress like drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem. The argument of individuality isn't true. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and changing into different clothes after school?
824	I think that this is a great idea. I remember every morning thinking about what to wear. This was a real problem for me and I asked my parents for new clothes quite often. I know that this isn't the case for everyone, but it would be great if the school had a uniform and everyone had to wear it. First of all, it would look great and be smart. Second, there would be no envy that someone else has a really nice skirt or jeans. Everyone would be the same and studying would be easier.
825	I support this view. When I was in school, I never had a problem with what to wear. However, when I went to university, I spent a lot of time choosing clothes. First of all, it is wasting time. Second, when all students wear one uniform, there would be no discrimination. A uniform shows students equality.
826	I believe that uniforms are essential, especially in developing countries, because all students do not belong to the same financial status.
827	If you do not want your children to wear uniforms, then go to a school that allows that. However, do not come pleading that your children are underachieving, easily distracted, or derelict. My message is clear, uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.
828	I believe that wearing school uniforms should be encouraged because it reminds children that they are equal, and it shows unity. Additionally, children feel included, and it helps them to work as a team.
829	It is better to have a bad father than be fatherless. You will have someone there to learn from and give you motivation to do better. You will never have that question in your mind of what it would have been like to have a father.
830	I would rather have a lousy father than not have a father at all. Having a lousy father means you have a father who cares for you and loves you. You can fix it. If he is bad, you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mother about. I don't know how it would be if it were only my mom raising me.
831	I would rather have a lousy father than be fatherless. My father and I do not always agree, but we do not always get along. Sometimes, when he gets home from work, he sits on the couch, watches TV, and waits for my mother to make him food. That is not ideal, but I love him and I do not know what I would do without him.
832	The fish are drowning. Don't worry, you are not alone.
833	Books are bad because it is harder to spell.
834	Television is superior to books because you learn more easily by watching, not reading.
835	Marriage is between a man and a woman. Homosexuality is a learned sin, and I do not want my kids to learn that it is okay. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality. If morality goes, then so does society.
836	I have already had my say in the debate and Indians have at least managed to learn these mongrel's language and are quite good at it. The rest of you English gimmicks stumble in your own tongue. I am quoting some sush102: "Hey it's better don't teach me the difference between chat and debating... If I start my debate then you will be forced to leave this site and run away..." What crap? "dnt," "ma," "dis" what kind of crap is that? It makes no difference what you say but it still remains that Indians are the best!
837	The Indian economy is growing at an incredible rate and may reach double-digit growth by 2013. Many economists agree that the demographic dividend that India enjoys could see the country sustain its high growth rate for a long time.
838	India certainly has the potential to lead the world. In our real world, power and weapons do not work anymore. Maybe the USA, UK, or other countries are more powerful, but India is economically stronger and is the hub for many other companies.
839	India is on my personal list of countries to keep an eye on over the next thirty years. I believe they are a good contender for superpower status before the end of this century.
840	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of God, there would be no valid proof that that God is Christian or not.
841	It is your decision whether or not to spank your child. Children can be bad, but only as a last resort.
842	I agree, but it should only be used as a last resort and not used constantly.
843	I agree, children are becoming increasingly violent and need to be disciplined if they choose to act out.
844	If children are afraid of getting spanked, they will not do it again. The parent should only spank them, and not go overboard and keep hitting them.
845	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not nearly as much resentment towards spanking. Today's kids are the most rebellious there are. I admit it is not purely spanking that is the cause, but it is a small part of the bigger picture.
846	I am a Christian, so I have to support my religion. I also get to go to church.
847	I am neither Christian nor Atheist, but I believe Christianity is superior to Atheism. If there is no place for God in your life, then your life cannot be called "life".
848	I would be glad to report my spouse for murder. Killing someone is the most horrible crime in this world. I would not want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I would not feel safe if we had children in the house or slept next to her. I would not be able to sleep or think right for months.
849	I would agree, my wife would be a murderer. Being a murderer is not the most happy life you can have, knowing that everyday you will be afraid for your life because the cops may come and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your life is in danger.
850	I would have to agree. She committed murder, which can land you in serious trouble, even if you are an accomplice. Regardless of the reason, whether it was accidental or there was someone trying to attack her, she killed someone. I will immediately contact the police, in order to prevent her from going on another killing spree or attempting to kill me.
851	The one who bestows life is the one who bestows death.
852	I am pro-life in the sense that abortion is being used as a last minute form of birth control. If you are not smart enough to use protection, take the pill, give up the baby, there are many people who cannot have children who would love to have one.
853	Embryos have human characteristics, even if they are not fully developed, such as heartbeats beginning at the 21st day of conception. Therefore, even if we cannot see the human form, the embryo has the potential to gain one.
854	I am arguing for the rights of the child, who deserves the same right to life as the mother.
855	There are many students who do not enjoy Physical Education, so it should be an elective.
856	This is not a commonly known fact. Can you point me to a reference? Or are you suggesting that homosexuality is helping to spread AIDS? In which case, gay marriage may help reduce the problem.
857	I have many gay friends and I am for it. People should stop being so against it. People can't help it.
858	I believe that everyone deserves to be happy. I have two good friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I do not have a problem being around them, either alone or with their partners. I believe that gay people have the same right to get married as heterosexual people do.
859	It may seem selfish to pursue personal goals, but it is the only way to achieve a common good.
860	I do not think many countries consider homosexuality acceptable. It is almost always taboo in society and most major religions. However, people should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that is what they are doing. Ignorant people tend to mix these two. It is their business what happens under the sheets.
861	The government has passed things such as "The Patriot Act" and "Terror Watch" which allow the government to spy on law-abiding citizens when that is forbidden in the constitution.
862	I am a firefighter/paramedic and I drive Code 3 all the time. The most dangerous part of my job is getting to the emergency through all the traffic. You would be surprised at the amount of cars that do not pull over right away. Hands free phones do not help that much either. You can have a conversation in your car with a passenger without much trouble because they can see what is going on with the traffic too and sometimes can even point things out for the driver.
863	I do not believe in psychics, but in a time of desperate need, many people, myself included, would do whatever it takes to get the job done.
864	Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried go back to the chat room and ask what they can do to keep you safe. I do not think you can be traced by the predator due to data protection. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
865	The difficulty in answering "yes" or "no" questions is not the specific question and honest answer, but the implication of that answer.
866	Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, only allow it during the first trimester of pregnancy. At that point, the fetus is not even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo'. During this time, the fetus does not look anything like a human yet and has no brain function. Thus, it cannot feel any pain and is not aware of its existence. During this time, most people who have had abortions consider the issue from a different angle. Please keep in mind that most people who have had abortions wrestle with their own morals and conscience in their own way.
867	I think it starts early. I am appalled at the way children use the term "spastic" as an insult. What are they learning at home to be so insensitive? It doesn't get better. I once suggested to Human Resources that perhaps this was a job that could be made available to a disabled person who might otherwise find it hard to gain employment. I encountered bafflement. "Any particular disability?" I was asked. I have a son who has been disabled since the age of twelve. He is hoping for a job worthy of his very considerable intellectual skills, but he keeps his disability well concealed when job hunting. He has seen too much of people's attitudes. In many ways, we still live in the jungle.
868	I think this may be very bad for all the police trying to do their jobs. What in God's name were they thinking? Some ignorant right wingers may think this is okay, but heaven help the cops.
869	I assume you are referring to the entire criminal justice system as the professional group. As in the series Law and Order, it involves enforcement as well as the legal profession. Additionally, part of the system is the law makers. Public policy is not always easy to define. Power and influence in an ideal democracy would come from the people. However, we know that is not really true. Young money will sway public opinion and buy almost any election and swing almost any vote whether it is public or in legistature. I am not sure what you mean by "playing policy roles." The direct enforcers offer direct power. The police and the judges. However, those who actually make the laws provide the true power, which comes back to the people with money to buy the influence to change laws. It really all goes back to the rich and powerful.
870	You could file a defamation of character lawsuit. I doubt the police would do anything about this. However, a lawsuit would be expensive and messy for both parties. It is better to let it slide, live your life honorably, and know that these people are petty and not worthy of your attentions. Light always shines through the darkness, and I'm sure the people who know you are aware of your character.
871	I would prefer the death penalty for violent rape and child molestation, but I would accept a life sentence if that was the only option. Right now, we have sex offender lists to protect the public against these people who have been released from prison. What is the purpose of these lists? We make the lists because they are still dangerous, but why are they released from prison? I say, just kill them all. Problem solved.
872	Lawyers are tricky and use tactics to get you to say what they want you to say. Some lawyers speak in a very demanding voice in an attempt to undermine your confidence and dispute the truth of your statements. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is to keep a cool head, remain calm at all times. If you seem unconfident, you may lose your case.
873	Criminals will find a way. Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. (Crime rates drop). For the record, the Second Amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a government that goes out of control.
874	I am not sure how to proceed. First, you will need a lawyer. The Constitutional right to bring your own case is often negated by judges who do not want to be bothered by non-lawyers. Second, you will need evidence that the person's actions caused you "Increased anxiety." As the testimony of a therapist. Then, it will depend on your state laws. This is a difficult case to prove. You might even have to prove the person should have known their actions would harm you. Get in touch with either Legal Aid, or the Attorney General's office to see if they have information on how you can make the elements of a winning case.
875	It matters to those of us who attended schools where all this was important, have or had parents who cared, and have jobs where it is important. If you can get through life without any of these applying to you, then you may well conclude that it is all somewhat irrelevant.
876	It is a little thing called freedom. Maybe your grandfather died for it. People are free to speak and write how they want. If you do not like it, you do not have to talk to them or do business at a place that caters to Spanish speaking people. I mean, in China towns across the nation, Chinese and other Asian languages are spoken and advertised. The government has a lot it needs to do before it needs to worry about what language people are speaking. And as people of your caliber often say, if you do not like how America is doing it, maybe you should leave.
877	I suggest a simple alternative that could be implemented in a backyard. First, use wind or wave power to generate electricity. Then use that energy to split water into its basic components. Then, use that oxygen in your car. Then, burn the hydrogen in your car to create water as a by-product. This could be done almost anywhere.
878	From an ethical standpoint, you should pay her back. She made it clear that it was a loan, and you agreed to it. However, I believe that ethically, she should forgive some portion of the debt because she was behind in what she was supposed to be paying you.
879	It is my opinion that legalizing marijuana should be done so that the government can regulate it and tax it appropriately. The laws would be the same as they are today, such as the requirement that you be 21 years old to purchase it, and the same as driving while intoxicated.
880	You will not receive a warrant. I'm sure a warrant has been issued for you. However, they are not required to notify you of the warrant. Contact the court and make payment arrangements. You will have to pay the original fine, plus warrant fees, possibly interest, and whatever else the local laws allow them to tack on. Or you can simply ignore it. The next time you get stopped for a simple traffic violation you can get arrested for an outstanding warrant.
881	Do not bash Clinton! He eliminated the deficit, and we had a surplus for a short time. All the while we survived and the economy was good. Bush blew it. He saddled us with that deficit. What is it up to? Eight trillion plus? Who is paying for the Iraq war? Who is paying to rebuild the place? Where is the Iraqi oil money? They are selling oil. Where do you think that money is going?
882	In my opinion, psychological treatment is the best way to treat criminals rather than sending them to prisons.
883	We have a lot of "Good Ole Boys" up there making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate. Get those 80-year old geysers out of there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits. Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works. The Good Ole' Boys are just biding their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves. All incumbents -- OUT!
884	I am having a hard time believing you actually got fined for throwing a cigarette out of your window. Unless your area has a risk of forest fires, then I could understand. Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation.
885	Yes, you are responsible for the passengers in your car, whether they are minors or adults. However, if one of your passengers is not wearing a seatbelt, you can get a ticket in addition to them getting one, even if they are an adult.
886	You have to be careful on how you play your game here because if he can prove that anything you say about him is untrue, he may have grounds for a deformation suit. If he has wronged you, there are a couple of things you can do: 1. Sue him for the wrong he did to you. 2. Contact the Better Business Bureau in your area. 3. Report what he did to the government group that regulates car dealers in your area. 4. Contact the TV station in your area that does customer complaint reporting.
887	You should seek legal advice if you are going to lose your job and possibly your home due to lack of money.
888	In prison, they have their own laws, and I am not talking about prison laws. If you do not obey them, you will end up dead. It is sad to say, but some of our prisons are run by the gangs that are in them.
889	I do not understand how he took the kids away from their mother, that is something that is extremely hard to do in court. However, if your sister wants her family back, you should encourage her, but remind her to becareful and try to save some money on the side for herself just incase. Perhaps he still loves her and wants to return to their happy life. Just try and help her secretly save some money as a just incase fund. I wish your sister the best.
890	Government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to listen to private telephone conversations or read private e-mails without the scrutiny and oversight of judges, who are in the last instance answerable to the law and to the public, they are creating a domain within the state that is exempt from the sovereignty of the people. This undermines democracy (however fake of a democracy it is anyways) and creates a state within the statue—usually thought to be a distinguishing feature of dictatorships, in which secret services, torturers, etc. are also neither answerable to the law nor to the people.
891	I am a gay man who can be fired from any job in the country for being gay. I can't have a civil union with my partner of nine years. I would be better off living on a deserted island with like-minded people. I am still grateful to be an American and for those fighting for what rights I do have.
892	A woman's body tells her when she is ready, she starts a period. Whether she is mature enough is another matter.
893	You can be emancipated if you are not pregnant, but it provides a judge with a fairly obvious reason to approve the request. I did it. It took about 30 minutes of completing the forms, a couple of signatures, and 5 minutes in front of the judge. Fairly easy, really. I do recommend it if you are going to need to be the one who signs for things on behalf of your child. Most people won't question you, but it's good to have in your back pocket, just in case.
894	I do not think the death penalty is fair. When people are executed, they only suffer a lethal injection, and then they are gone. The person they committed the crime against is tortured for the rest of their lives.
895	Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.
896	I believe our lives are our own and no one has the right to take it except ourselves. If the pain, suffering, and lack of hope is so unbearable, one should have the right to end his or her own life, be it by himself or by asking someone else to do it. For example, my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I think is ridiculous for obvious reasons. And if the person isn't able to do it on their own, asking someone else to do it, either by ending her life through "direct" methods such as a painless poisoning or by "indirect" methods such as turning off the machine that keep that person's heart beating. Please keep in mind I'm talking about voluntary euthanasia, not non-voluntary euthanasia or involuntary euthanasia.
897	From a physical and chemical perspective, neurons are fired when we see, smell, hear, touch, and taste things. Those neurons interact with other neurons via chemical processes that are well understood. Eventually, motor neurons are triggered which cause us to respond to the sensory input. In no part of this process can I see a way to affect the chain reaction of neurons in any way. Sure, each of our brains is put together differently, which means that each of us will respond differently to similar stimuli. But given the exact same situation, our brains will react exactly the same way to the exact same stimuli every time.
898	My reasoning is simple: dishwashers require the dishes to be "pre-cleaned". This defeats the purpose, why did I pay hundreds of dollars for a machine that doesn't have food processing capabilities? Also, dishwashers do not remove ingrained or dried gunk. This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher over a couple of days, and the older plates have already dried up. You have to take the still dirty plates and clean them manually.
899	"white privilege" is the idea that white people have better lives than minorities.
900	The invasion of Gaza is unjustified as well as impractical. It is the same as Iraq; you do not stop terrorism by coming in and ruining people's lives. Palestinians already hate Israel, and terrorizing Gaza only radicalizes people and makes them into Hamas militants. Additionally, Israel has shown blatant disregard for civilians lives; 50 israelis have died compared to 1500 palestinians. That alone should show you who is the aggressor. This is not about Hamas versus Israel, it is about the people born in Gaza and caught up in it. The invasion is terrorism designed to kill civilians and scare Gaza into subservience.
901	I have many more, but I will wait until a debate commences.
902	Governments use propaganda that a soda tax will reduce obesity, but the reality is it is just them being greedy trying to make more money off the poor and middle class.
903	I saw the movie Paranormal Activity and I did not enjoy it at all. The movie was slow and boring. I understand that people may not enjoy the movie, but I cannot understand why people thought the movie was good.
904	I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness, as long as they do not hurt anyone else in the process. Similar laws to alcohol should exist, such as not drinking in public. Psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD are not addictive. Furthermore, they do not cause any harm to the user.
905	I think that if the industrial system collapses, then all of the people who are type I diabetic will be dead within days or weeks.
906	It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the pupils be there for an upwards of seven hours should provide a quality lunch for its pupils.
907	Prostitution is between two consenting adults. It is her/his choice how she earns the money and uses her/his body. To address people who claim prostitutes are "at the mercy" of their clients: this makes government regulation even more necessary.
908	There is a lot of dislike towards people who post questions that have been answered before, however, that deprives all the viewers of seeing an answer if they never thought of that question in the first place. For example, I'm a huge fan of /r/askhistorians, however, I've never asked a question on there. I rely on others thinking of interesting questions I wouldn't have thought about and then reading the answers to them. It works much the same with many other subs. As there is no easy way to view historic posts unless they are "top", unless things are reposted, then there is no way for others who didn't see it the first time to see it again.
909	I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their premises, but only if the police are involved. Then, the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police impound lot.
910	I have read some scientific racism writing and I think many of its claims have no scientific basis. Shouldn't the differences between races be studied? People of different origins have different bodies, skeleton, skin color, etc. Why wouldn't they have a different brain? On the other hand, I don't want such research to be done because that could be misinterpreted by hateful people and lead to a resurgence of racism.
911	While the relic is interesting, it has little historical significance. Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose. Shortly after recovering the Cross, Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan. He thanks Mr. Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection. Therefore, Dr. Jones does not feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing. Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum. CMV.
912	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens use to gain better insight about mankind? Wikipedia.
913	I believe we should be putting millions into research of creating cool animal combinations. For example: a half gorilla, half octopus. The face is similar to an octopus, and has two legs and six wavy arms, and it is also furry. I do not buy the "don't play god" argument, because I am not worried about God smiting us for creating abominations.
914	I am a professional software engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field. Software should never be able to be patented, just copyrighted. This includes software algorithms. Most software algorithms are not non-obvious. For example, shopping carts, sorting a deck of cards. Most software algorithms are not difficult to understand. The only thing that should be protected is the final product. It doesn't give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products. Most meaningful software used is open sourced. What companies pay for is the specialized tailoring that is done to build a custom application. Again, your product is protectable by copyright, not patent.
915	I am not the one who created this topic. However, people free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line. It does not matter how good those Randite arguments sound in theory, 100% pure capitalism will not work.
916	I think black people have a bad reputation because they are more likely to be in jail for lesser crimes than white people. I am not saying that white people are not bad either, but there are things that happen to them as well. I think all monkeys and kreckers should be created equal, but separated.
917	I believe if we involve manners in this issue we will not have a problem.
918	I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. However, now I have to admit that there is little chance of the facts being available to them via regional news vendors. So, do what you are told America, but by someone marginally smarter than the current guy. Apathy has worked well so far and TV tells you which burger tastes best, so I guess they know which President is best too.
919	I do not think it is pointless, but our world has bigger problems. For example, world poverty, population, pollution, and the biggest threat...global warming. This will kill 6.5 billion people, possibly even more people in the near future. Scientists could focus on our world problems first and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on.
920	I disagree with filtering, but standardized. There should be domain extensions that are specific to "unsavory" industries, such as porn sites. A router can be programmed to block all incoming connections from a.xxx site. This way parents can block a whole group of sites by blocking domain extensions.
921	This is easy to answer: classical music is stagnant, most classical music fans are snobbish and want to hear exactly how it was performed centuries ago. Jazz, on the other hand, is always evolving. It is always adapting the latest music trends while remaining jazz. Yes, some jazz musicians are purists, but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way two times. Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the U.S.A. in New Orleans, and is made up of elements from Africa, Europe, and homegrown. Jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity. Jazz is the USA's greatest cultural export.
922	The Supreme Court ruling on habeus corpus is a referendum on the wanton disregard of Bush and his administration to do something they all promised to do - protect the constitution.
923	My grandmother was married for 50 years and only ended because she died. I have been married for seven. There is nothing I believe in more than love.
924	Test cricket is dying out, let's whack it on the head to finish it off and forget about it.
925	Each religion is in the process of spreading their count; they do not care if they believe from the heart. Perhaps that is the reason why most terrorist are converts. Perhaps that is the reason why most people who are converts in Christianity are poor people, and they are shown the bait of money. Ultimately, whether it is the spread of belief or the head count, I believe it is the latter.
926	The Terminator is better because he is made of full metal and he said in the movie that he can live for millions of years. Additionally, he can see everything when it is dark. He is also much smarter than Rob Cop.
927	The Bush administration and John McCain have equated any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemy governments or political parties they consider as terrorist to be useless at best. He supports his position by comparing any attempts to talk to Hamas, Iran, or other terrorist groups as "foolish delusion." He equates diplomacy to "the false comfort of appeasement" of the Nazi's.
928	How are you going to enforce this? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask for their license and registration, and conduct a breath test. "Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car." This will certainly give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of taxpayers.
929	I am sorry about that. What do you think? The media has become a breeding ground for industry and rich businessman with cigars. They no longer inform. Are you reminded of the 1976 movie "The Network"? I have heard about it, and it can be used as evidence that today, the news is not the news. It is all for the television ratings.
930	I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes. It helps me focus more when we are given assignments involving drawing and comics. I should probably figure out how to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just sketch and doodle stuff.
931	I am going to say the machines because they are not easy to kill. Zombies are easy to kill, but once they get ahold of guns we will have a huge war on our hands.
932	It's presence should be as uncommon as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation. We are the result of millions of years of evolution in a world that has no God.
933	The plot was good, the twist was good, and the movie had a moral. If you are going to complain about the audio, then you need to get off your prestiguous pedestal and hang out with the rest of humanity.
934	I had dinner here last Friday and the food was very good. I especially enjoyed the F'n Loaded Sliders which were filet minion mixed with blue cheese and a bottomless basket of garlic fries. The prices were very reasonable for such a delicious meal. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal without breaking the bank.
935	I have not been to a Sizzler in decades, but the quality of food and service at this location was very good. The salad bar, which had every vegetable you could possibly need, plus endless slices of avocado, was very good. The waitresses brought us our drinks and brought us our choice of famous cheese toast or rolls. The cheese toast is very good. Most customers speak Spanish, but that is just the area. The food is well worth the price if you are in the area.
936	This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack on the weekends. I love that you can order half size of the appetizers. This is perfect when you want something light, or you like variety. My wife and I usually bring our dog and sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For half an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are! I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice, the fish tacos, and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner. This is a great choice, and on a nice day, you cannot beat that location and view on the patio!
937	The room cost roughly $60.00 per night. The room was very clean and modern. The front desk staff is not helpful. I will stay again if I have no other choice.
938	Unless you want security to treat your fiancé badly, do not go here. I do not care if Tiesto or Calvin Harris is playing there. It is a joke. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult and/or hurt them. My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and swelling for a few days. Way to have a 300lb security guard push, shove, and grab a 120lb woman in heels, hope your ego is soaring.
939	The ribeye steak I had was not seasoned at all and was over cooked when we requested medium well. The service was also sub-par. It took a long time to get our food and our server forgot to put in our order for the kids. We decided to forego the additional wait and go somewhere else to eat. At least the setting was neat and the kids had a great time playing outside!
940	We tried Carpe Diem before when they moved to Elizabeth. This time the food was not as good as before. The steak was overcooked and the quail was not able to be able to read. The wine was overpriced and the salad was not very interesting.
941	The service was great, but the food was expensive and not very good.
942	I would only agree with school uniforms in private schools, and only if it was a voluntary association. I believe school uniforms suppress free speech and take away from a youth's individuality.
943	I had to wear one for four years at school.
944	It is not comfortable to sit for long periods of time.
945	I am currently using Firefox, which makes searching the internet more simple than using Internet Explorer.
946	The fact that the only rational argument for IE users is that they are cooler or get laid more is overwhelming evidence that Firefox is superior.
947	At least Firefox is not a copycat like Internet Explorer 7, which copied Firefox's tabs.
948	I am not interested in a prenup. She says, "I am leaving you and taking half of your money." I reply, "Hope you enjoy prison."
949	As humans, we are selfish and have been programmed with a survival mechanism that tells us to do whatever we can to protect the ones we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means keeping this horrible secret to my grave.
950	If my wife committed murder and told me about it, I would not turn her in because if you love her that much then you will have her no matter what.
951	I do not believe I would turn them in because of love. However, I certainly would not stay with her. I would move away from her as far as I could. For the simple reason I would not want to be involved with the crime, because I knew about it.
952	India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires. They cannot even lead themselves.
953	No, rags were used for scrubbing toilets, not headgear.
954	They are unable to organize their streets, bathe in the same river they bury their dead and defecate in. The Ganges. They are extremely poor and cannot even manage their own budget. I am going to get de-voted and insulted, but everything I have written is the truth.
955	It may sound bad but I would rather be father less. I would love my dad but it would not be the same if you had a bad father. You do not have to have a father, you can talk to someone else. Maybe it is just because I am a girl and it would be easier for me to talk to my mom.
956	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge, but it allows them to be tough and dependent upon themselves. Being fatherless is difficult, but it is better than having a bad father.
957	Farquhar has a boss, he has to follow raffles, and not do anything else. If that is the case, why couldn't Farquhar help Singapore after he was fired? I say again, you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, and effort are all invested. You must know people who would help you.
958	Raffles was the one who stopped the Dutch from taking Singapore.
959	Some argue that porn does not have a negative effect on health, however, studies have shown that it can slowly damage your immune system. Eventually, those who engage in porn in their relationships will not have the same health as others. Smoking and porn are both extremely bad for you.
960	Firefox is bloated and uses too much memory. Once everyone buys a new PC and gets IE7, they will have no excuse to switch to Firefox.
961	When you hover over IE7's tabs, you will see the page title and address. Firefox 2.0 only shows the title.
962	IE is much easier to use, and is more visually appealing. It is also much more secure.
963	Most people think that physical education classes are useless because you just run around the field for an hour. However, there is more to a PE class than just running around.
964	It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later in life. Additionally, there is the benefit of working together as a team that does not always happen in other classes.
965	I agree with you. I am in PE and they make us wear these ridiculous outfits. I think they make us wear those so the gay coaches can see our private parts. PE is just stupid.
966	William Farquhar was dismissed, despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development. As a result, many people would simply ignore Farquhar's contribution and credit it to Raffles.
967	When Farquar was fired by Raffles, he was given a larger ceremony before he left compared to Raffles, which shows how much the people loved him.
968	The people recognized William Farquhar as the founder because he was there to deal with the country's problems when Raffles was not there for them. He even took money out of his own pocket to resolve certain issues. When he was forced to leave, the people sent him off with sorrow in their hearts.
969	While I do not agree with the practice of abortion, I do not believe the government has the right to force people to make that decision.
970	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is incorrect. This is what makes these debates pointless. You have some ignorant creationists who do not understand anything about science. sabrejimmy has not attempted to learn anything from this debate. He continues to ask ridiculous questions. Personally, I think I will have to ignore his future posts.
971	I call the "God of the Gaps" because early man's understanding of the universe was very limited. For example, people did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore, the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical. However, man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.
972	Evolution has been documented and studied. I invite you to read this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and give your thoughts.
973	Porn is an abstract noun and can't be wrong.
974	Pornography is a way to release sexual desires.
975	The question is: who has the right to prohibit it? Government? Why would there be any pressing need at all for the state to outlaw pornography? Look at Europe- they're okay with pretty much everything. I don't see any moral depravity in Europe, do you?
976	Pornography is not always bad, but when it is giving equal gratification to all parties, it is not bad. In fact, I could consider it an art form in some respects.
977	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day, our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help ourselves.
978	As fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they are with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.
979	I think that school uniforms are a good idea. First, they make students look nice and tidy. Second, we can know who is studying in which school or who is in the same school as us. And lastly, it is convenient because we do not have to spend too much time choosing clothes for school.
980	I believe it would be better to have a bad father than no father. At least you have an idea of who he is and where he is. If he is a bad father, that will help you become a better father.
981	I would rather have a father than none. Fathers play a huge role in a child's life. They keep things stable throughout your childhood. My father isn't great, but he does support me and help out sometimes.
982	Yes, I have a bottle of water next to me.
983	Using plastic bottles is only for emergencies, as they do not decompose.
984	TV is preferable to books because you can get information from different sources in a shorter amount of time.
985	They can be recycled to make other things, like more water bottles. It also makes the water company rich. They are not expensive, about $3 for one of the big packs at Shaw's. That will keep you hydrated for several weeks for minimal cost.
986	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs. Additionally, big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would lose millions of dollars. Banning them would only hurt big corporations.
987	God created water bottles for a reason, because they are good.
988	Plastic water bottles are used everyday. Without those, we could comfortably walk around the block with a safe supply of water in our hands.
989	I like this website, but it is not very clear. This one is better: theworlddebating.com
990	Here is a reason why gay marriage could be wrong. If gay marriage is okay, then sister and brother marriage is okay as well? The answer is that the sex is the difference.
991	India has the potential to lead the world. Dr. Manmohan Singh is considered the most qualified prime minister in the world. India has proven its potential in various fields and aspects.
992	I would like to point out how few disputes there are on the Christian side. That is because free-minded people do not need to convince others. They know that there is not a god, and that it is up to us to make our lives.
993	For reasons that should be obvious and have probably been thoroughly discussed by others involved.
994	Getting hit helps you become stronger and grow up. It is not abuse, it is called getting spanked.
995	It should only be used when necessary to get the point across to the child.
996	I am an active Pastafarian and I am disappointed in the lack of recognition of our religion.
997	A parent should not use spanking as an option to discipline a child because the child may grow up traumatized or feel unloved due to the amount of spanking they receive; this will cause a low self-esteem. Additionally, the parent would be full of anger at the time and not thinking logically.
998	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals. I would not want my child to hit me.
999	As an ambitious young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder wouldn't have been a pleasure/malicious-kill, so the sentencing wouldn't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is the same as being in prison, except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1000	I agree, you never know when they will turn on you or when they will try to kill you. They are thinking that you know the truth and the truth cannot get out. They need to get rid of all types of clues, even of those they love, in case they try to talk to someone.
1001	I am not trying to be facetious, but you are suggesting that we should look to the government for guidance in our beliefs. Have you ever read T. Hobbes?
1002	I believe abortion is only permissible if the mother is unable to give birth to the child, and attempting it may kill her.
1003	I do not see the difference between killing an embroyo and a 40 year old person. Murder is murder.
1004	Why do we argue for the right to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?
1005	The champ, it is not the woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. If you are going to be irresponsible, do not let a new life die for it!
1006	Besides, only a few people apply physical exercise in their lives.
1007	A PE teacher's job must be very easy, since they do not need to learn anything. All they have to do is yell at kids for an hour.
1008	Gym class is a waste of time for students. They should be tested to see if they can run a mile without stopping every few feet. Additionally, students should use that class time to prepare for sports.
1009	Gay marriage is not harmful to anyone. Gay marriage is not going to end the world. Gay marriage is not in any way affecting anyone but the two people getting married.
1010	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person.
1011	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be.
1012	I believe it is more important to have a personal pursuit because if you want to begin to help others you have to help yourself first. It is not bad to want to help the common good but if you are always putting other people before yourself you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life.
1013	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must be happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for yourself, then you become a wreak. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
1014	Obviously, everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world, or save the city. However, only a small percent of people actually do these things. I honestly would like to help mankind, save the world, but I am posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good, all of the economical cars and factories would not just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
1015	I believe that personal pursuit is better because it is more about you, then it is about other people. If you can't focus on yourself, how can you focus or help others around you? I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that it is better to focus on yourself.
1016	In my opinion, both are good. There is no better choice. They balance each other out.
1017	There are many reasons why girls don't take safety seriously, and when their parents try to warn them, they end up going all out with guys because their safety antennae isn't as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victim. Therefore, girls need to take care and be aware of their own safety; don't give "strange" guys the upperhand if they don't want to be raped.
1018	The recorded conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. I do not know what the woman hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama. Some people are addicted to drama and will do anything to create it. Avoid these people, they will drain you.
1019	No, they cannot force you to do it. However, it may impair your credibility, so you can instead make an affirmation. I do not "believe in god" either. I also will not swear an oath to any state or government. Many legal documents require a notary seal, I refuse their oath, so instead I make only a documented affirmation. It works and is completely legal. (Save on notary fees to boot).
1020	The executor of the estate is supposed to divide up the remains equally, I think; that means for everything that is sold, you get an equal share. If they sold it, it doesn't matter if they already spent their portion of what they got, they still owe you your share. You can sue them. It is a shame people act so selfishly and unethical towards each other when their parent dies.
1021	The purpose of punishment is to reform criminals, however, in some cases the criminal is beyond the process of reformation and enjoys his criminal acts. For example, serial killers and psychopaths. Additionally, in some grave cases the convict has done such a heinous crime that the conscience of an ordinary person is shaken and capital punishment is needed to deter others from doing similar acts. Furthermore, such a punishment is given in keeping the norms of society in mind and in the least cruel manner, such as hanging. Therefore, I feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
1022	While driving, it is best to have both hands on the wheel. Please avoid using your cell phone while driving. Although it may not be legal in your state, it is always best to set an example. I have had my fair share of drivers who were not paying attention cause they were on their cell phone.
1023	The ACLU does not take on cases involving the government infringing on people's civil liberties. Additionally, where is your source for this case? You have provided only a few specific details, so I doubt your statement is credible. Additionally, the answer to your question is "no."
1024	Is it not the NY Times that you are referring to? That is the paper that the Bush administration is targeting. The government has a web site, magazine, and other media organizations that printed the same story. What a scam! Bush himself has made over a dozen public statements, since 9/11, mentioning how they are disrupting "terrorist" funding. Another disgusting Bush administration tactic to distort and distract!
1025	I disagree with the first person who responded, as they are a prime example of how powerful propaganda is. I do not recall hearing of any valid case where the use of marijuana was associated with any violent behavior, much less a killing spree. Regardless of what the government provides as services for those who are ill, it should not have the right to totally ban the use of certain substances, especially when those substances are less harmful than the ones that are legal. Wake up! Also, to those who complain about it being a gateway drug: If it was not illegal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug. It is only made bad by the hypocritical efforts of the government and the gullible people that trust their efforts.
1026	You are concerned about him having rights to your child should you die. To avoid this, you will need to get him to sign a legal document signing his rights away. You should also ask your local social services office if he will still be liable for child support.
1027	Even though the sentence was ridiculous to begin with? Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rd of a gram. Even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in prison for that long.
1028	I suggest you resolve this before it is too late.
1029	I do not know where you are getting the idea that they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care. It costs the state tons of money. My sister does this for a living and their departements are severely underfunded and understaffed. The workers do what they can but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officials that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads, the situation is not going to improve. It is really sad. My sister alone has about 50 cases and she is sposued to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least one visit and go to court monthly for each of them. There are just not enough hours in a day. Each caseworker should only have about 20 cases but they do not have the funding to hire enough people. I hope your situation works out.
1030	I am not sure I understand the supposition you are making. In general, however, I would argue that morality and legality can be viewed as a Venn diagram. An act can be either or neither; we probably wouldn't want it any other way. Hence the saying that "you can't legislate morality."
1031	I am not sure. I always call my electrician to help fix my plumbing. Perhaps the defense lawyer is more of a general practice attorney that works on many different kinds of cases. Or, perhaps he is an idiot. Worst case scenario- he is trying to save the ability to claim inadequate representation if you kick him around in court.
1032	I am not an American, I am Canadian and proud of that. There are things about the U.S. that I admire and envy, and there are things about the U.S. that I do not. The war in Iraq is one of those things. I think it was a huge mistake to go in and do what they did. The civilian casualties are a shame.
1033	If you live in Michigan, they will. Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking.
1034	I am sorry to hear the UK is going down such an ugly path. As for where to draw the line on rights and liberties, I believe the right to swing my arm stops a few inches from your face. I believe that you have the right to say what you want, except when it endangers someone else. Laws about what passes your lips can't achieve the real goal of the folks who write the laws: stopping ugly thoughts.
1035	It depends on what you are trying to accomplish and what type of impression you want to give.
1036	Civil rights- we are innocent until proven guilty, and having everyone on a database would be taking the opposite stance. It could even have the opposite effect, like, "they think I'm a criminal already, so why not do crime?". We still have the right to privacy to an extent, and having all our details on a database, microchipping us when we haven't done anything wrong, that would be a huge violation of personal rights. Still, the biometric ID card will be similar to the system you are suggesting. We will see if the crime rate goes down.
1037	I believe people sent to prison for drug abuse should be sent to rehabilitation centers. This is in contrast to drug dealers, who should be sent to prison for the crimes they commit to feed their addiction. Capital punishment should be enforced better, as 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.
1038	It is not legal because it cannot be regulated by the government, because it is generally regarded as a gateway drug, and because it hasn't always been legal, like in some European countries. Legalizing it would lead to a massive initial interest in it, which would lead to increased health care costs, as well as decreased labor quality. Additionally, all those drug dealers who sold weed would need to find something else to do, and I suspect it would not be a legitimate job, so it would also cause a spike in crime; probably gun sales, or increased trafficking in worse narcotics. It is a bad idea.
1039	What is your opinion on having sex with minors? Is it good or bad? If it involves a beautiful woman and a handsome man, then it is good. If it involves a man and a girl, then it is bad. If it involves two minors together, then the laws should be less harsh than they are now. An example would be when a good teacher gets in jail for having sex with a male student. For what? For making him one of the luckiest guys alive?
1040	If you and your mother have agreed on the rules, then I see no reason why you should not go on your own. Check the local laws and statutes in your town. Usually 18 is the age of adulthood, but there are exceptions to that rule in some areas. If you go live with a relative and you are "underage", then a guardianship contract would have to be amended by both parties, your parents and your live-in relatives or adult-head of house. I really do not think they will make a big deal out of just being one year away from adulthood for you, or anyone else, anywhere! I say, just pack your bags, and with your mom's blessing, go off and find your destiny my child! Have fun and stay out of trouble, okay?
1041	Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off. I favor harvesting of stem cells from donated cord blood. I see no reason at all why embryonic cells are needed at all in order to do the research that holds such incredible promise.
1042	I think that making murder punishable by murder is a joke. Also, if I were facing life in prison, I would prefer the death penalty. Unfortunately, in my country we have abolished the death penalty long ago. Therefore, we are not promoting modern liberal Western values to the rest of the world when our leading nation itself cannot follow these ideals.
1043	I am not sure if this is a question about the United States, but I often ask myself that same question. The most honest answer might be because we can control our technology, and we have the power to control proliferation, too because we see it as a danger. In general, it's probably not a good idea for every man, woman, and child to have an atomic bomb. Do you really think that nothing bad would happen if every country had enough bombs to destroy the planet? Yes, that would be great. I do have to admit there is a certain irony to the United States being so controlling about nukes. We say we can't trust others to have them, but who's the only country crazy enough in the history of the world to actually use one?
1044	You should be able to do this job if you have the education and training. However, be aware that the people you will deal with are living in a different reality than you and I. The strong survive and power means everything.
1045	I know it is a cliché, but it is not insulting. India is not poor, it is quite rich in history, etc. If you think India is poor, it stays poor, but if you can write better English, more people get jobs, and India becomes rich.
1046	If you listen closely, they say, "You have the right to remain silent." This is true, but also, remember that when you are being questioned, you are not always a criminal. You must be proven guilty, but you are first innocent. At the time when they are questioning them, they are suspects.
1047	If the person is mentally handicapped and can prove it with a doctor-supported diagnosis, then I do not suppose the person should be prosecuted. However, if someone is supposed to be taking care of or has guardianship of the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. I also think hunger is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue. If it is not, it should be.
1048	You are using the equipment provided for you as an employee, and the school has the right to ensure that it is not being used for illegal purposes. If you do not like the terms of the contract you sign to use school computers for email, then you should just stop using them. They will also monitor the websites you, and any of the students, visit.
1049	We are not taught from a young age to respect alcohol. If we treated it more like Europeans, it would not be considered taboo. That is why teenagers drink until they are sick and act like idiots. Also, those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You are not sexy when you are drunk.
1050	I believe the legal age should be 18. While it is still young, you should have finished your High School and have lived under your parents law for a long period of time. As for drinking, let's be realistic, anyone under the age of 21 can get a license. It is not that difficult.
1051	I do not want to repeat the past. Furthermore, I believe that a president of his country should be born here. Any other job can go to anyone else with legal status, but not the presidency.
1052	I do not fear "the competition." Besides, my husband is very good at home. Most of the prostitutes I've seen aren't very attractive. They are drug addicts who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized they could make money off their own sex. Personally, I believe that it should be legalized. Also, in most places where it is legal, they are tested for diseases on a regular basis, which solves a major problem.
1053	I believe that this system solves many problems with the death penalty. First of all, an innocent person will always choose life imprisonment. During this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. Second, the convicts freedom of choice remains intact. Third, life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an "out". Lastly, the method of suicide should be left up to the convict.
1054	We are born, we live, and we die. These are constants in our lives. So why should we be motivated to do anything? I am in a position right now where I am between jobs, and in a general transitional phase in my life. Dealing with societal strife is meaningless. I should just withdraw from society and live out my days surrounded by cats.
1055	"Be yourself" is an excuse for doing all sorts of stupid shit and not improving yourself. We, as a civilization, have progressed so much by striving for the better, striving for perfection, and doing everything to make the lives of our descendants as good as possible. People glorify all kinds of objectively bad things (morbid obesity, being an asshole to other people, ana/mia, heavy drug addiction) under the parole of "that is who I am and you have no right to judge me."
1056	I am in full support of equality, but I do not think the current method is working. I have encountered many people who support it but are unpleasant. I am looking for proof of progress or benefits of aggressiveness.
1057	You have no control over where you are from, like you have no control over what color your skin is. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they are from, and not how they play.
1058	It has become increasingly clear that the country does not work for the betterment of its citizenry and I do not see it moving in the direction of ever reaching an equilibrium. The culture there just continues to go in the wrong direction of idolization and total submission, people are working and barely able to sustain themselves. I believe the two countries should be united and the South Korean system should be accepted. This is difficult to state but I think this would be the better outcome than continuing the way it is going. How this is to happen is not really a concern of the topic posted.
1059	I do not disagree with the sentiment, and I do think it is a horrible situation, but the way it is executed paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror. This in turn promotes it in a way that is both nefarious and ineffective. A lot of people will feel that this particular campaign has a lot of merit, but I do not think it will work this time due to the reasons stated.
1060	We should research the possibility of shooting large amounts of trash into the sun. It would disintegrate before it reached the sun, but perhaps we could do it once or twice a year where we could be certain it would land. Or, perhaps we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. Scale-wise, it is highly unlikely that it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earth's escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that would not burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1061	I know that with science most people are now able to have children, but I feel that it is selfish. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for adoption and to spend over $3000 on a surrogate agency doesn't make sense to me. Also, the most successful surrogate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them very little in order to use their bodies. Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking, so knowing that a woman went through that just to give birth to a child she will never see again makes it not seem right.
1062	Polyamory has been discussed a lot in the media recently, and I tend to read the comments on these articles. The majority of people are not supportive of polyamory, and are more inclined to "Nope" or "Ick." I am in a polyamorous relationship with two men, and we live together, but they are not in a sexual relationship with each other. We are happy, healthy, stable, and long-term. What is objectively wrong with my relationships? I know it is not for everyone, but that is not an argument in itself.
1063	My grandparents were born between the late 1920's and the end of the 1930's. According to most of what I've been told, marriage was something people did. Divorce at this time was unheard of, so if your partner changed, (as most people do) then you were just kind of stuck with someone you didn't like. I don't believe that someone is cognitively ready to make a lifelong decision at that age, and most people of this time period got married to pacify their parents, society, whatever.
1064	I feel that the amount of money they are being paid is excessive. I am not saying that it is not fair that they are paid as much as they are. I am saying that they should be paid a sufficient amount that they do not have to worry about finances, etc. However, that money could be used to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding it. I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they are given.
1065	This is partially inspired by the "new look" Ronald McDonald that was revealed on Twitter recently. I feel that companies who use cartoon or clown characters as part of their marketing strategy to kids are unethical. They establish an early link in developing minds that these products are fun and safe. When a person reaches adulthood, the link becomes permanent, and they still consume these products out of a sense of childhood nostalgia.
1066	I am an avid sports fan, but I do not understand the massive following for baseball and American Football. I have tried to sit through full games, but I find there is a severe lack of fluency and action in both sports. I feel like I am missing or not appreciating something about these sports, and if I was made aware of some uncovered aspects, I would enjoy them a lot more. Are these sports really that exciting? Or is it more that they have been ingrained in the American culture so much so that the attractiveness and appeal of the actual game is an after thought? Please change my view, as I would love to get involved.
1067	I never tip because I think tipping should be banned. Instead, employers should be legally obligated to pay a decent wage, and if customers choose to tip, that should go directly to the server. I've never understood why employers are allowed to pay employees minimum wage, and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage. I don't feel anyone should be guilted into paying a percentage on top of the bill at a restaurant to pay the server's wage, when it should be their employers.
1068	Florida's major metropolitan areas are vital, technologically advanced, trade and commerce, and entertainment. I have lived in this region my entire life, and even though we took a beating economically, it is disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area since it is nothing more than God's waiting room. There are too many stick in the mud. Tourism is an economic driver, but it should not be the only one. For the love of Pete, change my view before 2015. That may be my opportunity to move to Tampa Bay, should I have the means to do so.
1069	Many communities (e.g. Less Wrong, MIRI) and books (e.g. Our final invention) have appeared in the last few years attempting to combat a potential AI doomsday scenario. However, I do not think this kind of universal optimizer is the trend in AI research. To me it seems the focus (with deep learning, etc.) is on imitating the cortex's memory system and building really powerful classifiers. I'm not saying we shouldn't theorize potential disaster, but I think the current fear is overblown CMV.
1070	I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but it has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims. However, police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse.
1071	I believe there is a superior layout, (which one I think it is, is irrelevant), and one of the companies simply can't budge because of stubbornness.
1072	The most commonly accepted opinion is that Duchamp's Fountain was an early and successful example of asking the question "what is art?". However, almost all installation art since then has been the same. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery, etc. etc. Almost all contemporary installation art is criminally dull and boring. The greatest crime that art can commit is to be boring. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. However, with modern art installations in museums, it's the opposite. I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
1073	I admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head win. That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It is absurd to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).
1074	The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is necessary.
1075	The war on drugs has failed and people need to be educated on the subject.
1076	In relation to the recent Indian election, where Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi won with a landslide, I cannot see any good in this man for the long term. Although he may have a good economic record in Gujarat, he will destroy the religious toleration for which India is famed. It would be better to retain Congress, who although they are corrupt, are not responsible for the massacre of Muslim pilgrims. Aside from this specific instance, is it better to be tolerant and corrupt, or effective and intolerant?
1077	I think that could be a contributing factor. Additionally, our media does not show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. There are thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc. So, having a war on our own land could give Americans a taste of their own medicine.
1078	I would support the decriminalization of marijuana, as long as it is still illegal to sell or advertise it to minors, and it is not used while operating automobiles or heavy machinery. There are several benefits to legalizing marijuana: First, people who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the workforce. Second, due to the fact that there will be fewer prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system. Third, federal and state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are taxed. Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. As a result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market.
1079	It is safer than alcohol, nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal, it would be easier to regulate. A good example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed), and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (like they do with weed houses), which could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When prohibition was removed, organization returned to society.
1080	I want this website to be more active. There is almost no intellectual stimulation anymore. I haven't learned anything worthwhile in weeks. I will try to have at least five debates a week. They will start with "Wake Up Convinceme" and cover a range of political, social, and moral issues that I feel are stimulating and not discussed enough.
1081	This debate isn't about whether kids should eat candy, but whether governments should ban ads for kids that portray candy-eating as good. It is legal for kids to eat candy, so why should it be illegal for people to tell kids that they should eat it? Besides, kids naturally like sweets, and the ads only convince them to choose one brand over another, not to start eating candy. We need to bring responsibility back to the parents instead of letting them use the government to babysit for them. This should be a no-brainer for anyone who claims to value freedom.
1082	There have been many instances in the last 100 years where nations have invaded other nations and the world has become angry and revolted. Yet, some ignorant Texan does it and gets away with it.
1083	Truth is different for each person. For example, when I flush the toilet the water goes counter-clockwise. However, for someone in Brazil the water goes clockwise. Ultimately, we are both correct. Scenarios define truths. Perhaps the typical Christian answer would be Jesus is the truth, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
1084	In the NFL, quarterbacks are paid more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions they make.
1085	I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he is taking hits as far as this oil spill is concerned and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I do not think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took $77,000 from BP and directed the corruption between politics and oil companies as the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.
1086	First of all, let me define what wrestling should be: Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two unarmed persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other. Are we seeing this on television? No! The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats, etc. as weapons, which means that they are harmed! The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible. I can remember clearly the'Undertaker' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a terrible sight!
1087	We all know that guys want to have sex to impress their friends and show off that they have some. Soon after, the guy will leave the girl after he bangs her and goes off to someone else. In the end, guys pressure their girls to have sex when they aren't ready and if they want it really bad they'll break up with the girl and go out with someone that will give them some so they can feel satiated. That doesn't make any girl feel confident about themselves and it makes the guy a selfish asshole.
1088	We should not have to pay for education as it is vital for society to function. If people are unable to afford the price of education, consequences will occur such as many children's futures will disintegrate. Education is what gives people the power to achieve goals and success; what right does anyone have to refuse to educate someone simply because they are unable to provide the funds required?
1089	Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Unless I am missing something, Heaven and Earth are still in existence, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happened. I open with these words from the Messiah Yahushua himself, and take him at his word as he is no liar. I realize my post is not in a question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed...The Torah/Law is forever!
1090	In the long run this is a good thing for the economy. China has kept its currency low so that it can continue to provide really cheap goods to the US. If the dollar gets low enough, Chinese goods will become more expensive, hurting American consumers in the short term but ultimately strengthening the domestic market for US producers.
1091	I went to this restaurant on my last night in Montreal. It seemed to be popular, and was busy when we got a table. The prices were confusing, and I felt that we were charged more than we should have.
1092	The new space is phenomenal, and the food was even better than we expected. We had the rib taco and the brisket taco, as well as the slaw and the black beans. They know how to cook, and you may want to call ahead for a reservation.
1093	We had a great lunch at Zeta's and will definitely go back.
1094	I am not sure why this place has such poor reviews. The food, drinks, and atmosphere were great. I did not feel rushed to turn our table over as quickly as other restaurants do.
1095	I went there on 10/20/2013 around 6pm with a group of 6. We ordered hummus as an appetiser and the main entrees were potato pizza, lobster gnocchi, roasted chicken and burgers. We all experienced diarrhea at some point during the night and some experienced vomiting. We all experienced acid reflux and lots of gas which disrupted our night. We all had some sort of gas problem. I do not know what was going on with the food that evening but will not return.
1096	There are not many wine bars in Mesa, so D'Vine is a nice refuge when wanting to stay in town. It is right around the corner from me and saves driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale. The food has always been tasty and the staff has been friendly. The only wish is that they would stay open a little later on the weekends. 11pm would be perfect.
1097	I am very fond of this place. The food is consistently good, and I am not sure why we haven't been back sooner.
1098	I wish I would have gone to McDonalds and had a better experience. This place is getting very high ratings despite my experience.
1099	I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it? My favorite feature of Firefox is the tab option. IE requires you to open a new browser in order to search two websites at the same time. It's pointless. Besides, Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart. I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
1100	I believe FireFox is superior to Internet Explorer because it is the default browser on most computers. I would wager 90% of IE supporters only know that single browser.
1101	If my husband committed a murder, I would most likely not turn him in. We are husband and wife and I will always be there for him, no matter what.
1102	I would not turn in my spouse or family and friends if they committed a murder. Those people are too close to me. Why would anyone send away someone they love? Especially if you live with the person.
1103	I would say books are better because they require imagination, the more you read the more your imagination improves, as well as helping with reading, grammar, and writing skills. Also, I hate commercials. I hate Spongebob! I would say PBS Kids, History Channel, and other channels that help kids or adults get smarter.
1104	Books can reduce our electricity bill, which uses a large amount of our spending money.
1105	Books can make you smarter, and they can give you information about other people.
1106	It is not wise to say that some people cannot read. People who cannot read will always run away from them. Even then, B is for books and B is for best. Books are the best. I cannot sleep if I do not read a chapter from a novel each day. Sometimes, reading books all day becomes boring. I only watch TV and news channels on occasion. By reading books, I can pass my time, and even improve my speaking skills.
1107	We cannot say for sure if India will lead the world, but there are other countries who are more progressive, more literate, and more powerful than India.
1108	I would have to answer "fatherless." I would rather have no man in my life than have someone who isn't concerned about my life at all. In my opinion, that is the same as being fatherless. I can always find another father figure, or more like a male role model.
1109	A father is someone who is always there for you. He is the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of your baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. However, if our father is someone that does not care about us and spends most of his time in his room, then how can we trust him to protect us? I would rather have no father, than a father whom I have a hard time trusting.
1110	I have always thought that a true man should be respectable, honest, and hard working. If he is not that kind of man, then he does not deserve to be a father. Besides, just because you do not have a father, that does not mean you cannot have a father figure in your life.
1111	I believe both are bad, but I would rather go fatherless. Why is it important to have someone in your life that isn't good? A father should set a good example for his children. If the dad isn't good, then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a bad father, I would tell him to step up and be the father he can be or get out of the house and never come back.
1112	It was normal that Raffles gave the duty of turning Singapore into a successful city and left the city to Farquhar.
1113	I read in an abnormal psychology book that people who watch porn are normal, but people who are in the porn are not normal.
1114	This degrades morality and affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed as merely sex toys. This affects how men perceive women which will lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: marijuana.
1115	I think it is wrong, it goes against women's rights, and those girls are underage and abused. It is also sick in a sick way. What freak would film people having sex?! I don't understand it. I don't see what's so good about it. If you want sexual entertainment, masturbate or something.
1116	Pornography is wrong and should not be watched.
1117	I think that pornography is wrong because it should be in 4-D, with surround sound, and special effects. It would make it much more pleasurable. By the way, I am a girl.
1118	According to your theory, the fruit flies would have adapted and survived. However, I am not sure how that argument holds up.
1119	If evolution is true, then why aren't people still evolving?
1120	You must not know anything about debate because what I am doing is called "Cross Examining" and it is a common tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position. Also, calling names has never won a debate. You simply cannot answer my questions, and I'm sure that is frustrating for you.
1121	Why is creation not a science? Why is this classified under the religion category? Do these deluded people think they look like monkeys?
1122	IE has the best virus interface in the world, so why wouldn't you welcome those little cute viruses by sticking with Microsoft Internet Explorer?
1123	Although they state Firefox loads faster than Internet Explorer, in reality, the vast majority of users who have just installed Firefox will experience slower program load times than when using Internet Explorer.
1124	The average IE user gets laid twice as much as the average Firefox user.
1125	If physical education was not required, then you would become a couch potato. How would you like that?
1126	There were many pests at the time. Raffles was not around, so William had to think of a solution on his own.
1127	William legalized gambling in Singapore to allow the city-state to prosper, but Raffles did not participate in the activity.
1128	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle. Raffles did nothing of that sort.
1129	Farquhar was the one to put the ideas into action, whereas Raffles was only a visionary.
1130	William had done a lot to help Singapore, but Farquhar was unjustly exiled by Raffles.
1131	I do not think a mother should have the choice to kill her child, but I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered human. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have equal rights to a cow.
1132	It is not up to us or the government to decide if we want to add more unwanted children to this world.
1133	A few years ago, a young girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout Catholics. Consequently, both of her children died. That is three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.
1134	Abortion is not murder because a fetus is not a human.
1135	This is an interesting thought for those of you who believe life begins at conception rather than birth. America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that person is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
1136	I have to say that there is sufficient evidence to support evolution.
1137	Is God coming in the year 2100 and not in the year 2000? That makes no sense. God created all things and has no time.
1138	How come people aren't still evolving? How are you so sure we are not? Could you please show some evidence that we are not evolving? And do not say, because we would notice if we were. Solid, verifiable evidence is your key to proving your point.
1139	As long as it is legal and everyone is of legal age, there should be no problem.
1140	I believe common good is more important than personal pursuit. Assisting other people is more likely to result in a positive outcome. You become a role model by helping someone in need.
1141	In my opinion, advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by the person or people you are helping, but it makes you feel better as well. It does not mean that I will not spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I will do my best to accomplish that.
1142	This is planet Earth that we all share, and if given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it. Choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish.
1143	Advancing the common good is always better than pursuing personal goals. However, most people choose personal goals because they will benefit from them.
1144	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not selfish. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people, then there would be no need for common good. You are the only person who knows what you feel, think, and believe. If you want change, you would make change to yourself.
1145	I believe advancing the common good is preferable, because it will eventually come back to you. Whether it be money, fame, or simply karma.
1146	It is a good idea to separate students from other people to increase garment jobs. Why do we use soldier uniforms? For separation from civil. Why do terrorists not use soldier uniforms? For harmony with civil, and easy to attack enemy.
1147	School uniforms do not harm students' lives emotionally. As for the point of expressing oneself, imagine one bully wearing a shirt, tie, pants, and well-polished shoes. Wouldn't he look good? Remember that dressing sense is also part of your interview.
1148	I believe it would be better to have a lousy father than none at all.
1149	I believe it is better to have a bad father than none at all. It is important to have a role model and without that figure, you may become lost in the world. A father that is always working and does not have time for his children is not the worst thing that can happen.
1150	It is better to have a bad father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you have made on your father. He will not pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he does not think you need it. He would not care so much that he would get angry and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall, making a hole in it, for not cleaning the sink after breakfast or forgetting my keys. I think that is actually an opinion because that kind of father is still bad because he will tell you that he hates you and that you ruined his life.
1151	I do not ever want to be here. Like punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare. If it falls apart, I would surely wake it. Bright lights would cleanse me. This is worse than it seems.
1152	I think TV is better when you are watching an informational channel, and it is better than books, because you can switch to different informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects, then when you are finished learning and ready to relax, you can switch to a funny show or whatever else you want to watch.
1153	If you are fluent in one language but are forced to move to another country, you will find that books are not available in your language. However, television programs are available in many different languages and you can hear how words are pronounced in other languages.
1154	Gay marriage can cause a lot of trouble for people. In extreme cases, it can cause people's lives to be at risk.
1155	India is a country that has a great development rate and is known for its contribution to the discovery of God Partical. I do not understand why people think India does not have the potential.
1156	India has the potential to lead the world, but I do not see that happening anytime soon.
1157	We have scientific evidence that the flood of Noah could not have happened. For example, we should expect to find the remains of long-deceased animals and people all over the world. Instead, we do not find this at all. Additionally, dinosaur bones are found in many different layers of rock strata, at different depths. If the flood had occurred, we would expect to find dinosaurs and all other remains in the same layer of rock, but we do not.
1158	I think it is better to try a different option besides spanking because it can affect a child's way of thinking and may make them depressed.
1159	I believe that spanking should not be accepted as a form of disciplining a child. There are many options that parents can employ. That is why we have a mouth to speak and say what is right from wrong.
1160	Some parents spank their children for small things which is not right. As a result, their children will always be scared of them.
1161	I believe spanking should only be used as a last resort and parents should not rely on it when their children are misbehaving.
1162	I agree. No one should get away with murder. That said, I would never marry someone who would murder someone.
1163	If my spouse committed murder, I would have to turn them in. The relationship would not be the same, it would change. You view them as a bad person, and you think of them as someone who could do something to you.
1164	If my husband murders someone, I will turn him in. Murder is a crime, and there are consequences for every act. He will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
1165	I would turn her in. Murder is murder, and no one should commit murder. I would live in fear of her killing, and if I did not turn her in, someone would eventually find out about her killing, and I could be arrested as well. It would be sad, because she is your spouse and you love her, but I would rather her never tell anyone, because that makes my life easier.
1166	The vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone whenever they were inconvenient to me, I would leave a trail of bodies behind me.
1167	I think physical education should be about education, teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy lifestyle. Not forcing an overweight child to run 10 laps around a track. Instead, showing them that eating right and exercising can be enjoyable.
1168	I do not care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage. Gays should have equal rights to married couples. It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court will not take a case on this because they are leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is.
1169	I would say most people in Britain would say it is wrong, however, I think anybody should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love. Because how come we can get married to the other sexuality, but a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman, and a woman as gay. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like.
1170	Gays have the fundamental right to equal happiness. They are still part of society. The government would have a better image if we allowed the third gender to marry. It also proves that racism, sexism, and hatred are non-existent.
1171	Your religion or culture should not affect your marriage to the opposite gender. Gay marriage does not affect your marriage to the opposite gender.
1172	I believe that personal pursuits are better because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others, you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself.
1173	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I am more of a selfish person. I would rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I have giving moments, so it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to choose the personal pursuit.
1174	I do not believe that he killed his ex-wife and her friend, but this book, which is in poor taste and very offensive, is his attempt to convince an overwhelming majority that he is innocent. I think he has lost his mind and since he lost his civil court case, the revenue from his book and other gain ventures should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
1175	It is protected by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' -Speech also implies expression. Secondly, desecration of the U.S. flag is currently legal, although recently (2005) the House passed a law making it illegal to desecrate the American flag. It is still awaiting further approval through our legal system.
1176	In my opinion it is a violation of my rights, but I cannot afford the fine either. They are getting tough on the fines lately.
1177	I have heard of Scientology schools, but I have never heard of it being taught in public school. There are many front groups that do various things for the community, like Narconon. These groups do not advertise that they are really Scientologists, so it is possible that if you heard that Scientology was being taught in a certain school, it is definitely run by Scientologists.
1178	I work with several police departments and I trust all of them. I also trust the city I live in. There are many great officers there who are respectful and caring. They try to do the best they can for the community. The chief is awesome and backs his officers. We don't have many leave from there.
1179	You have clearly been wronged, and should not think about stepping down. Fight back. I have won three lawsuits against the police in my lifetime already, and I'm only 21 years old. We the people cannot stand for this outright ILLEGAL behavior by law enforcement. If you follow the proper measures, and take this thing to the "top of the hill," that officer will never work behind a badge again, and the business owner will be liable for so many damages to you, he will be put out of business.
1180	I say, sentence them to life in prison, put them in our worst supermax prison, and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." The guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terrorist. I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves. It may not deter anyone, but what will?
1181	This happens all over the world, countries that break the law are protected by the United States, unlike other countries that would have been kicked out of the United States.
1182	If someone in my family had to be killed, I would want the person responsible to pay. Even if it meant going to the gas chamber or lethal injection, then so be it. It may not bring back that loved one, but I would have the satisfaction of knowing that they could never do it to anyone else. Thank you for the two points.
1183	Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945. President Bush is still living in 2006. Unless one of them can time travel, it is impossible for them to be the same person. I understand the different sexual orientations. I may never reach level 4 by answering these types of questions, but it is starting to get less boring.
1184	Regarding the property, if it is in your home, no one can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. Since it is unlikely theGP will falsify a police complaint, I wouldn't worry too much about the property. Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home or property without a warrant. In the matter of the child, you really need to consult with a local attorney. Good luck and hang in there.
1185	If self control was practiced we would not have to factor in the unwanted people. There are plenty of people who want but can't have it. There are excuses such as "My child has a right to live more than I do." However, abortion is not really good for a woman's health either.
1186	If the minor is under twelve, I would say no. However, at twelve, I think you are fairly aware of the things you are doing and the effects of them. Additionally, there have been a few murders committed by twelve-year-olds in the United States. I believe they should be tried as an adult, and punished as such.
1187	The liberal demagoges have made it okay to do all these things. If, in some way, drugs or alcohol became a band, they would immediately demand that the law is "unconstitutional". They took the picture of George Washington praying out of a school because they said that it was "unconstitutional". He is our founding father! They just took his picture out because they thought it was suggesting Christian values in the school.
1188	As a lawyer who used to work for a firm that did liquor license litigation, it is not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol. The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors. If the decoy just says to the clerk, "Oh, come on!" and the clerk gives in, then the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors, and it is not entrapment.
1189	There is a reason that you have to be an adult to serve on a jury. Teens, in general, do not possess the rational and mature thought necessary to make objective decisions based on the evidence. They tend to go more with what their emotions are telling them, which cannot be done in a court case.
1190	If that is the entire story, then that outcome is completely bogus. There is nothing wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a "bad" place, which clearly was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street. What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests. And how is someone who was not convicted (i.e. innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn't make any sense at all.
1191	The chances of getting marijuana legalized are slim. The way things are going now, smoking is banned here and there, how things are cooked, what you can and can't say. We are in the "control your every way shape in mean for your own good" nanny state of mind.
1192	Polygraphs use a baseline and go from there. If your friend was nervous from the start then that would be his baseline. I measure changes, not overalls. The would have to be extreme for him to fail. I know you want to stand by your friend, but do what you think is right. Have him volunteer for another polygraph from another reader.
1193	While this may seem like a contradictory statement, I feel that affirmative action promotes reverse discrimination and is necessary in some cases.
1194	You need to find a job. Your ex has children to support. How do you expect them to do it without you having to bear the responsibility as well?
1195	Violent career criminals will continue to be released back into society to make room for nonviolent first-time offenders.
1196	First, drugs are illegal, so a punishment should go there. Using drugs causes crime, which may not have occurred if the accused was clean. Consider priors, and then put together a jail term and a drug rehab program. I would suggest a 3 to 5 year sentence, with less time for good behavior. You are correct about a killing being less time, which really stinks.
1197	The people have no idea about the freedoms they enjoy compared to the people of China.
1198	I agree with parts of both answers. It has to do with a child's cognitive development. It is usually during those years children go from concrete to rational thinking. That is why some subjects are not taught until children are older.
1199	First of all, Walmart has one of the worst ratings in terms of how they treat their employees. I know people who boycott them and have encouraged me to do likewise. They are not like Costco at all. Why would Californians want to encourage a store to treat its people poorly? Why would they pay when full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their bennies, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans? Why would they want the related stress that comes with the anger and worthless feelings of being in such an environment so many hours a week? Why would they want them around at all?
1200	You get what you pay for and if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. I would recommend increasing your limits on COMP and COLLision. Also, ask the agent for a copy of the policy itself, called a specimen policy, and carefully read through it. If you are comfortable, then go for it. Be advised, anything not covered by the policy in theory could be charged back to you. I work for an insurance company and have seen people's lives ruined by not having enough or the RIGHT TYPE of insurance. Bad things do happen to good people. I hope this helps.
1201	It is not going away any time soon. In our society, you can give sex away for free, but you cannot sell it. Mostly, it is for moral reasons. There are arguments made about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it currently stands.
1202	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty because if someone killed a family member, I would want them to face the ultimate punishment. However, the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty due to the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe, but it is not. Not all cases involve DNA, and those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. Therefore, oppose it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown number of innocents sentenced to death.
1203	I lost a friend to drugs last year and it was very sad. Drug use is generally psychological and there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness. For example, many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders. This is an example of peer pressure. therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compuslion to use drugs. So yes, I believe in treatment. I believe you should help yourself. However, one can only get treated if they are willing to accept help. For repeat offenders, I offer no sympathy.
1204	You need to find a job that will allow you to continue your employment after your felony is behind you. You cannot afford to get fired.
1205	I am not sure public corporal punishment is a good idea, but there is a lot less people living in this country now. There is a lot more crime, so there needs to be some type of punishment.
1206	Not really because you did not fill out an accident report and your work will argue that you did it at home and you do not have proof that you did it on the job. Did you tell anyone that your back was hurting before you left work? If you did, they have to sign an affidavit that you did hurt yourself on the job and put their job in jeopardy and risk losing their job as well. If you do hire a lawyer, be prepared to fight a long and powerful battle and, nine times out of ten, you lose. It is best to go to the chiropractor and keep your job.
1207	I am not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling is a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit. However, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competing companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.
1208	It seems like it, but no one is above the law. If he is a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau, and the city for code violations. If he has the police and law enforcement in his pocket, that is shameful, there is not too much you can do. I would recommend staying away from him if at all possible.
1209	You are probably safe. Not 100% sure, but about 87% sure.
1210	Regardless of race, people should not have to feel like they are just like everyone else because of their race.
1211	Since it is illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what is the point of funding one? It is basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win. You will never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that there is some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.
1212	I believe there is a stigma associated with marijuana despite the fact that the usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco is socially acceptable. In fact, many scientists believe caffeine and maybe even sugar are more dangerous than marijuana. This societal norm is the sole reason that marijuana is illegal and not allowed for many employees even in states where it is legal.
1213	We have all heard the saying "don't believe everything you see on the internet", which assumes that information gathered from other sources not online is more credible. I disagree. I believe that just because a propagandist had the money to spend to distribute their information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't give it any more credibility than typical things we see online. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, I just don't believe that idea.
1214	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that probably their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but that doesn't matter. That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said, I don't want to see statistics about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos, or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how they are actually discriminated against.
1215	I know this is not true for all religions, but I am mainly referring to Christianity and Islam (as they are the ones I know most about). I believe that morals should be like trading cards; you can swap them out whenever a better one comes along. I think that without religion people would be much more willing to accept new views as they come along. For example, Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. People basing their moral views on thousand year old texts seems obscured to me. I am aware that there is room for interpretation, but I think the world would be a better place if people made there own moral decisions instead of being prescribed them by their religion.
1216	I would like to hear your ideas on what humanity's ultimate goal should be.
1217	I am aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. This may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but I still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting should not be. Because of this, I feel like I am closing my mind to a lot of good, right-wing ideas. This has singlehandedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which is something that I do not like.
1218	I would like to start by saying I am a generally positive person. However, sometimes I feel that the world is just one step away from a global disaster. This is a difficult question to answer, but I would like to have a little more hope about the future of the world and mankind. Please help me change my view.
1219	To keep this discussion focused, I ask that colleges in large cities be excluded. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a "college town", considering this factor makes the topic too broad.
1220	If there is high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would there need to be an influx of more cheap labor?
1221	The burden of responsibility to protect me falls on the government. In my opinion, the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun. Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder. If someone is injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, but were unable to do so because the government deprived them of the means to defend themselves, then I believe the government is partially to blame for allowing that situation to happen.
1222	The usual counter-argument is that inventions need to be based on previous knowledge, so the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to mankind as a whole. However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental. Additionally, I believe that abolishing intellectual property could result in prejudicial to science and progress as fewer people would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovating.
1223	I believe the killing of the palestinians in Israel is taking the shape of genocide. By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the palestinian side has many more casualties than the Israeli side. They do not seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas. If Hamas is using their own people as human shields as they say, that does not justify just wrecklessly killing them.
1224	I believe the rejection of showing them at work only prolongs the idea that tattoos and piercings are for immature, wrongly rebellious, and unprofessional citizens.
1225	Freedom of religion is a false concept. It is like having the freedom to use whatever perpetual motion machine you prefer. Because those are not real, guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful. Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference.
1226	I feel that having to present a photo ID to prove you are the person you claim to be voting as, and to prove you are of legal voting age is a fair requirement. Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for (car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling on an airplane, etc.) requires ID so why not something as important as voting. There are even some that call it discriminatory. I feel that it only discriminates against people who have bad priorities (IE someone who registers to vote, but doesn't feel the need to get actual Identification.) Please change my view. Thank you.
1227	I believe the idea of a twelve hour clock is a relic from a time when we did not have a better way of measuring and keeping track of time. I do not see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It would make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person. From what I can gather, the only reason we still use twelve hour clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.
1228	I believe that fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation if it is done correctly by a great leader such as FDR. Of course it doesn't work with horrible people such as Hitler or Mussolini, but what about Hideki Tojo? In my opinion he was a good leader, though he chose to support the Axis. He did, however, know when it was time to give up and stopped causing the blood of his people to be shed after seeing the destruction of the Atomic Bomb. What would happen if fascism still existed, with a competent and great leader in control? In my opinion, it would become prosperous.
1229	We see naked animals all the time, and it is common knowledge that sex is how most animals reproduce. Since humans are similar, and since sex is not harmful, there should be no laws regulating how we choose to dress or where we engage in sex, as long as we are not on another person's private property.
1230	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place.
1231	When trying to generate creative solutions, it is best to keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them. Entirely rejecting ideas or the weaker associations between different ideas, while seemingly pragmatic, only serves to stifle the creative process. Thus, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to occur effectively. Do you agree or disagree? Why or why not?
1232	I would have to vote for The Incredible Hulk, also known as Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is extremely strong and gets stronger the more angry he gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o) Anyway, back to the subject at hand. Thoughtprocess' Momma is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk. Snapilicious!
1233	I am entering my senior year of high school, so I haven't dropped out, and since I am active and very athletic, I am not a lazy fat person.
1234	The Dark Knight is a grand epic, but Year One is more of a crime comic than a superhero tale. Batman fights dirty cops and the mob with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli's realistic art matches the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less revenge driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they should have made more than four issues.
1235	I believe we should. Consider this: if there was a terrorist group in our homeland, then wouldn't you want help? It is the same scenario for the people in Darfur, they want help, but they aren't getting it. Also, if we lend a helping hand, then it will put America in a good light.
1236	I can easily guarantee that most people who say this have a weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Furthermore, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet. People fail to look at history objectively and only assess it in the context of their own generation. I'm not a fan of Obama at all, but I can reassure you, we have had at least five to ten leaders who were much worse than Obama is.
1237	If you were wealthy, you could live the lifestyle you chose. You could go on vacation, pursue your interests and hobbies, and live the life you desired. If that was not enough, you could give a large sum of money to the poor and people would still like you. If you still felt insecure, you could hire a coach and other resources to help you overcome your fears, and your friends would encourage you to use your money for a good cause.
1238	I believe the consequences are adequate. People have to register as sex offenders, serve jail time, pay fines, etc. These rules were created for actual pedophiles. If teenagers and younger people who do not deserve it are being subjected to these as well, then they do deserve it, for the reason that they choose to act like these criminals, and they need to be taught a lesson. Things are being taken for granted too much within this generation.
1239	I am a Catholic and believe that abortion should be illegal. If you know you cannot support your baby you should put it up for adoption.
1240	As a brief intro to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. For those of us who do not know much about philosophy, just argue about the question. For those of us who do, there will be a debate within the debate. I will be arguing that we should kill the one person. My first regular argument is that even if you do not intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them. My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.
1241	There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
1242	Opera is a great browser, but it is not well known.
1243	A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
1244	Love is a chemical reaction in the brain. So who is to say that teens cannot fall in love? At least for a period of time.
1245	I am not familiar with the details of this story, and I do not know whether the slap was heavy or where it was placed on the body. There is a lot of information here that I do not know. However, I do believe that to turn one's back on a hostile situation like that and note that it is the domain of policing or child protective services deprives us of a little bit of our humanity. I am not saying that every intervention needs to be violent or threatening in nature, but I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and important to act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences. This is what compels us to stop when we see an accident and offer assistance. If it was me, I would like to think I would have intervened. Who can say unless you are in the situation, though.
1246	We have to accept that steroids were common in Major League Baseball from about 1985 to the present. This will most likely result in some records being altered, but that is not the point. The Hall of Fame is a museum chronicling the history of baseball, good and bad. To exclude someone from the Hall of Fame because of suspected steroid use is ridiculous.
1247	This debate has no moral. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women, and here we are looking at women have to raise children. Children choose in court or in an out of court statement who they would like to live with. If the mother is in a mental state, then who is she to raise children to be somebody one day? Perhaps you should say that in most cases children opt to live with mothers, but there are some cases where fathers step in, and personally, I think they MUST step in.
1248	I still love the food, but I stopped going here because of the poor service.
1249	This place is horrible. We walked in and no one acknowledged us for over five minutes. The employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally, they told us it would be ten minutes. We waited a few minutes and then they said it would be fifteen minutes. There were plenty of seats open as well. Very poor people skills.
1250	This place is one of my favorite Korean BBQ places. We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is very good as well. The steamed egg is great when it is cooled down. We usually go to Rolled Ice Cream afterward.
1251	I have been going to The Zen for over a year now and have yet to be disappointed in the quality of the food or the excellent service. I have tried many different dishes and have always found them to be my favorite compared to other restaurants. I have had pleasant conversations with Steven and beg him to open a store in Peterborough.
1252	I was pleasantly surprised by both the food and the atmosphere.
1253	The Beef Wellington was very delicious and the bread pudding dessert was a great touch. I would definitely recommend this place and Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington.
1254	I had heard good things about Tim Horton's, so we went for breakfast before our train back to the States. The bagel did not taste fresh, and the eggs could barely be found. My girlfriend had the bacon, egg, and cheese on an English muffin which was tiny. They ran out of hash browns, but offered us a doughnut instead, which we did not want. The coffee was so hot that you could not hold the cup more than 10 seconds, so we had to throw it out. We were already delayed and had to catch a train, so we chalked it up as a loss.
1255	I think it is bad to wear school uniforms because they make you look unattractive. You cannot express yourself enough, so is band school uniform okay?
1256	I do not see a match. FF is superior in every way.
1257	It depends. For example, if she killed someone who deserved it, it would still be scary to sleep with them. Therefore, I am not sure.
1258	I cannot imagine behaving in such a manner. I know that if I were to do such a thing, my wife would be beside me, not speaking. Additionally, if she were to kill someone, it would be for a legitimate reason.
1259	Books are better than TV because they are cheaper, you do not need a TV license, and books can teach you things that TV does not.
1260	Books will always be great, no matter what new technological developments occur. Books have a permanent place in every human heart.
1261	I strongly believe that India cannot lead. You people talk about the 7th, 3rd, 2nd rank of India in area defense and arable land respectively, but here we are talking about the supreme power. We cannot rely on 2nd or 3rd. Additionally, the people are lazy. They do not have the time to think about the country's development. They are happy at their home.
1262	India is finding it difficult to manage itself first, so there is no question of leading the world so far. However, if we compare the following points: 1. almost 90% of India is illiterate (I am not sure of the percentage), so an illiterate country can't lead the world. 2. India is more into castes, politics, religions, and less into development. 3. India does not have confidence in itself and is still cursing itself. If this continues, then it is difficult or even impossible to say that India will lead the world when it cannot lead itself.
1263	India has the potential to lead because it has the second largest population in the world, and the third largest army. Indians are proud of their country and believe that they can do anything.
1264	Being fatherless would ensure that your only heartaches are his absence and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and then walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. In my opinion, having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence, because either way he knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
1265	I think it would be better fatherless. The reason is that I have never had a father. I think that if you have a bad father, you will be taught to be bad just like him. Parents are supposed to set examples for their kids, not just be lazy. What is the point of having a bad father your whole life? You will not learn anything from him, so why keep him? I think that a mother can raise a son the same way a father can.
1266	I went through the same situation as you, I was fatherless for eighteen years and I still think about him sometimes. I would rather have a father who wants to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.
1267	No, when you research Farquhar, you will see that he did nothing to help Singapore while Raffles was away. Instead, he created a mess and allowed things like vice, crime, and gambling to continue.
1268	In the past, children could walk around as they pleased, to and from the candy store, to and from school. Now, there are child pornographers and sexual predators online. Pornography has opened the door to new crimes.
1269	Although humans have sexual desires, it does not mean that people you do not know should watch you in pornographic content. Have sexual desires for the one you love.
1270	I meant the creationist version of evolution.
1271	I can demonstrate that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history.
1272	That does not make sense. Why are we still evolving, and the monkeys are not? Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? If it happened billions of years ago, why is it not happening today? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
1273	You and I go to school together and you are fourteen years old.
1274	People need to get up and exercise.
1275	I think we should have gymnastics because kids get fat and chubby. It is not acceptable for kids to become fat and chubby.
1276	When Singapore was infested with rats and centipedes, Farquhar rewarded the people with coins for every pest they caught. This solved the problem quickly, as he held to his promise.
1277	There were many pests like centipedes and rats all over the island. These pests caused harm to some people and destroyed food supplies. Tigers were also a threat to the people. The solution was to give rewards to those who killed these pests.
1278	Farquhar ordered his men to return from Malacca with food. Additionally, traders in Singapore brought some necessities to this location.
1279	This is not your decision, nor is it anyone else's except the person involved. This is an overblown issue where people are being killed on both sides. It is ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.
1280	Hitler's mother wanted to have him aborted, and they should have let her.
1281	The entire scientific community agrees that evolution is occurring.
1282	Women are degraded by pornography, but it is their choice to choose that career path. If they want to be in that business, it is their choice.
1283	According to a law professor at Northwestern University, easy access to pornography may be the reason there has been an 85% decline in rapes over the last 25 years.
1284	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected in society, then there would be no argument that pornography is degrading. Likewise, if we were to berate movie actors, then the act of being an actor would become degrading. The issue is not the production of pornography, but the reception of it in society.
1285	Some people say God is against porn, but the Bible does not mention porn, nor did it exist during biblical times. Therefore, how do we know it is a sin?
1286	I believe that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason is that it is better to help others than just think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves.
1287	Advancing the common good is better, as the Bible states, "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport, where all players need to believe in each other. For example, last night in the Super Bowl, the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last two minutes without the lineman blocking for the quarterback, the quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback. Therefore, we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
1288	I feel that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself first will not be beneficial in the long run. I believe that helping others before yourself benefits you.
1289	First, uniforms make everyone equal. If children can wear what they want, they will feel less equal to their peers around them. Second, school is for learning, not how you look and dress. However, in some instances, it does matter. For example, people who go to school that do not have uniforms take approximately one hour to find their pants or shirt. When they have a uniform, it takes less than ten minutes to take it out and put it on.
1290	Children should be equal and do not compare clothes. If they see something new from their classmates, they want to buy it even if it is not necessary.
1291	It means you do not have to worry about what you have to wear. It is less awkward when people say wear school uniform and you wear mufti.
1292	Uniforms will make everyone look nicer, and you will not have to spend forever trying to figure out what to wear.
1293	I believe that it is better to have a loving father than no father. Growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood. You would be constantly questioning who your father was and what he was good at or bad at. Additionally, you could never prove to your father that there is greatness in him. This would mean the son he created turns out to become a bright and better person in society.
1294	I like television because you can watch all the porn you want with your family.
1295	TV can be more beneficial than books because TV can show the faces of the characters and action can be displayed that is difficult to decipher from a book.
1296	I am not saying this because I love the tube, but you get more information than you think on the tube. For example: news, baseball, Spongebob, and more.
1297	TV is more effective than books because you can watch it in one sitting whereas a book takes all day to read.
1298	I hope TV wins because it is great to watch anything.
1299	The American water companies are Aquafina (Pepsi), Dasani (Coke), and Perrier (Nestle). These companies employ Americans.
1300	Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake at this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day, which helps the economy. Maybe not in a large way, but every bit helps.
1301	Why are you arguing about a US decision while you are in Canada?
1302	Yes, that is true if they continue to manage the positive and effective economic agenda. The first thing they need to do is to promote their economic policy to investors and tourists. Regards, Jerwin.
1303	India is an international institute such as Nalanda where students from many countries come to study.
1304	Indian culture and languages were established over 2,000 years ago, and other countries are finding their languages useful.
1305	Indian people have always been powerful, why are you forgetting about their ancient history?
1306	I do not doubt this. India has the power to lead the world.
1307	I am sad to see the way this turned out. There was not enough respect and spamming. I choose atheism over Christianity because there is not enough evidence to satisfy my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
1308	Until you have disproved all evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity based on empirical fact, or a strong priori argument. Once you have done this, disprove all logical arguments against Christianity. Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. Until then, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.
1309	There is no god, science has proven it. It was an excuse created so people from simpler times did not have to think too hard on those big questions.
1310	No one has ever waged a war in the name of atheism.
1311	I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, because spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
1312	Yes, children need to learn in a way that they remember if they do something bad, they will get hit.
1313	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm. It is like touching fire. It depends on parents and kids. It may do its job or may not, but abuse is never good.
1314	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, is there harm? Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For an ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.
1315	I do not believe in Christianity or atheism. I am a Muslim, which is the best religion.
1316	This debate proves that the internet is full of people who do not respect other people's beliefs and cannot leave people alone to worship or not worship as they choose. Atheists are bigots, plain and simple.
1317	Science has proven the existence of God, the question is which one.
1318	I always root for the underdog and the atheists here are much larger.
1319	Christianity does offer hope in the world and encourages others to help the poor.
1320	God will help those who help themselves. Therefore, I will go and help myself to the school laptops.
1321	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the last option. I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you are beating the kid.
1322	If a child is young, they do not know what is right and wrong. A parent needs to teach the child about what is wrong.
1323	I believe it should not be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child so they will stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside from hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldn't learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They won't do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them.
1324	No child should be hit. There are different punishments you can give your child.
1325	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. You cannot love a person if they are not the person you fell in love with. And I would not fall in love with a murderer.
1326	I am all for the no snitching saying, but murder is different. First of all, I probably would not do anything about it. Then I think about there are a few reasons why someone would be driven to murder, but I do not think the act should be committed. In saying that, I would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
1327	Having choices is good, but having all the choices in your life would lead to chaos. I have always been pro-life, and believe that abortion should be illegal.
1328	No one has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid yourself of moves away at the first sign of pain without you feeling it, then that which is no longer yours.
1329	Gays are human beings just like us, and should have equal rights to marriage.
1330	The egg and spoon race is a great idea! Perhaps the royal family should breed more uninterbreed children to take part in the warfare. Imagine them against the vodka drinking Russians. I think there would be less control over the masses, which would be a good thing. There would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world. There would be little communes, and then gang rivaled cities. At least all the fighting nobheads would kill themselves in one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it.
1331	I do not think it is very charitable of you to donate your old clothes that you no longer want and then expect to receive financial compensation (i.e. a tax write-off in return). Perhaps you could sell the clothing to some homeless people who have money from begging?
1332	A good proposal for an amendment for the Constitution would be to change the requirements to be president. You would still have to be 35 years old and a resident of the United States for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part. Instead of being a natural-born citizen, make it be a United States citizen for 40 years. This way people whose parents move here when they are kids; this would be the only way that they know and know as much as any other kid here. I think this would be a great topic to talk about in your paper and could easily be elaborated on with examples. Remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
1333	Attempted murder and officer involved shooting are two different things.
1334	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor. This is a good thing as it allows you to invest the money, instead of letting it sit in your bank account. If this is a court-assigned inheritance, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor. Other than the investing, what the person wants to do with the money is up to them. There really isn't any other steps to worry about. You do not need to tell the government, you do not need to include it on your taxes unless you want to, and frankly, other than investing, there isn't much for you to do, aside from get the check, cash it, invest it, and live.
1335	If you are serious, consider donating it to a worthy cause. There are many ways to use it: a young family in need of assistance, an elderly person in need of assistance, or a children's hospital.
1336	If he does not have a competent attorney, you need to hire one immediately. These types of cases can be especially complicated, as there is more at stake than you may realize. For instance, a conviction on a drug charge may mean reduced or little eligibility for federal student aid in college. I urge you to contact a skilled criminal defense attorney in your area. Be prepared to pay a sizeable retainer. For a referral to a criminal defense attorney, contact your local or state bar association.
1337	Is this a traffic ticket? If it says on the ticket that you need to appear in court, then you need to go. I would not listen to the cop. If it says on the ticket that you need to appear, just pay the fine or whatever it says on the ticket. It is important that you follow the printed instructions. Ask your husband. He may know the city's counsel and can get you out of this whole thing.
1338	Prostitution should be legalized, as should drugs. Decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades. There is no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.
1339	He is doing exactly as he should. These cases can cost a firm a fortune to pursue, so he needs to make sure that taking this case on is a good financial decision. He cannot do that without an informed opinion on the facts involved.
1340	If that person was under oath and was "giving himself in," I'm sure that the court would allow the person to be taken into custody. It would be a time-consuming process, but I guarantee that if you are under oath and admit to a crime, the court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork. Anybody who would testify in court to doing a crime who did not really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow. Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth.
1341	All these years I have been paying income taxes. We actually over-pay each year and then receive a partial refund in the spring. That is great as it helps cover credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas or to do a home improvement project. However, many Americans end up having to pay in even more because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year.
1342	The language you use should attract people, not distract them. There is a psychological phenomenon known as "I don't care" which is akin to "freedom of speech." There are many different ethics, values, and approaches that are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. Therefore, I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and continue sharing your knowledge with us. I hope to hear from you soon.
1343	Is it legal to force your religion on others that do not believe in it? If it was Islam they were pushing in school, would you want your child present? It is not only moral to remove religion from schools, it should be mandatory. Children are in school to learn, not pray, or learn about God. If you insist on God being present in schools, send your children to a seminary for an education.
1344	False imprisonment is something that happens more often than you think, especially in states that do not have discovery laws. In my opinion, those states do not have those laws for the simple reason that they want to be able to railroad the poor and innocent. The southern states are really good at that. As long as there is no discovery, the prosecution can hide facts that clearly prove the charged person is innocent. They do this knowingly, to embellish their conviction record to help further their careers. The part that kills me is that not only are these criminals still able to sleep, but the law allows them to get away with it. When it is discovered years later, usually, it is too late for the innocent person to do anything to get back the freedom that was taken from him.
1345	Your attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case, you would have to go after him for garnishments, etc.. If he does not own a paid home or other material goods, your attorney probably will not bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance, but he would have to determine if you could use it since you weren't driving at the time. Since you say you have $170000 in medical bills, I am guessing you don't have any personal medical insurance either. Your attorney should be able to tell you what to expect to receive after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
1346	I agree with you that the death penalty should be abolished. I am not talking from a legal point of view, but on a moral level that no one has a right to take another person's life. Life in prison, making to rot in jail, or made to work, is better than putting someone to death.
1347	Is it true that felons cannot vote?
1348	The United States cannot afford not to be friendly to China, a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc. Therefore, even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us. Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically. We can afford to play the bully, assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power, and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-US satellite that it was for decades.
1349	Freedom of the press does not mean that you are free of consequences. Geraldo was thrown out of Iraq for airing American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle.
1350	Our constitutional right to privacy was definitely negated in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I do not think it would be too hard for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop legally. Bush is just trying to cover his butts, as well as other members of our government. There are many conspiracy theories floating around concerning Bush and a few other members of our government. I think it is time the people of this nation take our government back, there are too many "actors" in power with selfish intentions!
1351	Scott Peterson was a "normal" white guy who had an affair and killed his wife who was pregnant. It was a warning sign to the rest of us to not lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was having an affair while your wife was pregnant.
1352	I disagree. First, it is the people of Singapore who should make that decision. Second, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society. Singapore is a society that tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity, but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created. Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is "more expensive" than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.
1353	If you continue speaking sense, they will start listening to your phone calls and reading your e-mail.
1354	The concept that people have this right is an ethical question and I support the position that all have this right. However, whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive. In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights, including that of information. (1) Every country has a segment that would restrict information and any of the other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of political party there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish controls and those who do not want controls.
1355	I hate the people that got into college with low test scores/gpa just because of their race. On top of that they get money for being there. Congratulation R.D. you have made me into a racist.
1356	Blame the sanitation workers for fighting for better wages, benefits, etc. instead of fighting for an education. Blame the unions, and blame the employers for falling for their diatribe. Americans are doing themselves out of jobs. Don't point a finger at immigrants or the employers. Where else can uneducated people who do not fit well within society find work at $20 an hour with health insurance, vacation, and paid sick days?
1357	Marriage is a business, and the license makes it legal. It is there to protect women's interests as far as property is concerned, and for raising children. It is a protection. IF YOU DO NOT PLAN TO MARRY, OR HAVE NO CHILDREN, OR HAVE NO PROPERTY, THEN THERE IS NO NEED FOR IT. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T ENTER INTO IT LIGHTLY. IT WOULD HELP THE DIVIDO RATE IF THE BENEFITS OF MAKING MARIRD WERE ELIMINATED.
1358	Any society that values the value of human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include floogging and capital punishment in their justice system.
1359	The church has a tendency to exonerate itself whenever it sees fit. I do not see where this would be no different. The idea that the church is not flawed and is the body of Christ is something that it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since its conception. If it shows flaws, misjudgment, mismanagement, etc., can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfection? So to answer the question, yes, I feel it does exonerate itself.
1360	It can if you have the right attorney. Racial remarks are a form of sexual harrassment. The company, along with the person, and the supervisor can be held liable for it.
1361	The actual pronunciation does not make any difference. I have been black my entire life, and I have heard my mother and father say it, but I have never really used it. I hate that word, and its use. I think people use it because they are afraid of saying something else and looking "corny". When I was in college, I suggested "not my ni99a, my brother" day, and it worked.
1362	I am unsure about religion, but I have yet to hear a logical reason why abortion should be allowed at any time for any reason other than saving a mother's life. Partial birth abortion is murder, by torture. Stop stereotyping members of the pro-life movement.
1363	Money is not the root of all evil, the love for money is. People put money above God, family, and friends. Love is the greatest thing in the world, the problem is people love money.
1364	It depends on the crime. For the most part, I believe if you are grown enough to commit an adult crime then you should be punished as an adult. If we continue to allow youth to get away with serious crimes then older criminals will continue to get our youth in trouble.
1365	Notify your lawyer immediately, and if you do not have a lawyer, get one. You should contact the court to determine if a hearing is actually set for Friday. Even though you might not have been served with papers, it would not be a good idea to ignore this situation. For example, your ex might have gotten someone to falsify a proof of service to show that you were properly served. You might have to request a continuance and properly prepare for the hearing. If there is a hearing and you do not show up, the court might make an adverse ruling against you that could be difficult to undo.
1366	I think that if Youtube took over Twitch, it would help with the servers, and make Twitch run more smoothly.
1367	The government is correct to state that teenagers should not be drinking alcohol, but in my opinion, nobody who has passed their teenage years should be denied. Obviously, the drinking age should not be 18.
1368	In the UK, every few years the government's cabinet has a reshuffle and the minister in charge of, for example, education moves job to become minister in charge of transport. Surely it would be more sensible if every few years elections were held where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position? The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me.
1369	I am not saying all poor Americans are like this, there are many with mental or physical health problems or an extremely bad start in life. However, the majority of poor Americans are content and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society.
1370	My school has a policy that if there is a bomb threat the entire school must pile into our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad arrive. However, a smart terrorist could easily find out this information and plant a bomb in said stadium, killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to just run to my car (off campus) and escape. It is worth saving my life 100% of the time.
1371	"Public officials" might be elected, though the process is hardly transparent and verifiable by most voters, but they rarely face penalties for making their bad ideas into laws that others have sworn to enforce. This also applies to the enforcers. If they do experience scandal for their wrongdoings, the worst that happens to them is losing the next election. In extremely rare cases they might spend some months in the most expensive prison, whereas those who are not politically connected and do the same crime face long prison sentences. Why are most people okay with this? Are they ignorant of the mechanism of this political machine?
1372	I do not understand why anybody cares about parity. The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there are a handful of titans competing, not a mediocre field where anybody can win. Sure, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga, but tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other. People do not tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in probably any sport.
1373	I have never had an issue with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once while staying with a female friend. The argument is that it is considerate, but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. This would make the whole thing moot. Additionally, in a large building or household, the next person to use the toilet could be a male and need to urinate, in which case he now needs to put the seat up again.
1374	I am not sure that the death penalty is used primarily as a form of retaliation, so perhaps we should want as many people as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, this will disseminate information to the public about what execution in the United States is actually like, which may change someone's opinion about the death penalty.
1375	The public has a right to know about stabbings, robbery, etc. However, the names of the perpetrators should not be disclosed to the public unless it is a matter of security (the criminal is currently at large or imprisoned).
1376	Until we have a better understanding of how the Earth's systems work and interact, the high-level predictions (more drought, higher oceans, etc.) are important, but it will be the more nuanced insights which today remain scarce that will give us a real understanding of what the world will be like in the coming decades and centuries.
1377	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a pee, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I urinated sitting down. A few days later, I was hungover, and decided to sit while I urinated. Now I do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to pee so I can tuck my penis under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to pee with morning wood can be very annoying. It has nothing to do with being homosexual because it does not involve sexuality at all.
1378	I am a young male, 19 years old, and I am considering having rhinoplasty, chin augmentation, and jaw augmentation. I would never say that I am ugly, but I am average. I think that once I get the procedures done, I will become dramatically more attractive. This will boost my confidence to approach girls, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having an attractive face, and a strong body, which I am going to build, will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.
1379	I would rather be too cold than too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the majority of his rivals. Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead.
1380	I have a problem with the idea that we have to "teach boys not to rape." As if rape is something that is hard coded into the Y chromosome.
1381	I am 30 and have seen us "at war" with al Qaeda/terrorism through military adventurism, nation building, and diverting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors instead of using that GDP to help our own citizens. It seems to me that the Military Industrial Complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000 years...). It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on Military adventurism. To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.
1382	I am a casual smoker. I usually buy a pack approximately five times a year in times of stress. This time was due to an untimely break up. Am I fooling myself by rationalizing that American Spirits are not as bad as other brands because they do not contain additives?
1383	I have been to four methods of schooling and the problem with all of them is that they rely on memorization instead of understanding the concept of what is being taught. I have honestly learned more from reading. I think the education should be improved so that students can pick their classes. Though, I understand, some classes are needed. But, others aren't. Some students will never be good at certain subjects and never wish to be. For them, schools should take those classes out of the schedule (depending on the class), and replace them with something they plan on having a career in. Also, Economics should be in the prime schedule. Many house foreclosures come from people who know little in the world of economics and rely on others to manage their money.
1384	In most cases, if you clearly committed a crime, your punishment (or lack thereof) will be consistent with what is fair. However, having been through the Illinois Court System, I now know that getting what you want legally is based much more on who you know. It's very much about connections. Connections between prosecutors and defense, prosecutor and judge, defense and judge, etc... Such is life though. The best way to be successful is to have an advantage over the other guy IMHO. Something that distinguishes you from them.
1385	Europe is not a continent, rather it is a cultural realm. There is no major division between Europe and Asia. Some might argue for the Ural Mountains as a barrier, but no other continents are divided by a single mountain chain. Continents are divided by vast oceans and seas. Powerful Europeans did not want to be associated with Asia and wanted to be considered their own physical continent.
1386	The impeachment of a president would be disastrous and catastrophic. Those who believe President Obama is an awful president must not realize he is not the one who put us into such a sorry economic state. If he continues improving the economy, it is possible we can set ourselves back on the correct track.
1387	You do not have a right to tell other people what they can and cannot read, write, or listen to, as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, if you are reading, writing, or listening to a direct order to kill someone innocent, and you intend to follow that order, it is illegal. Similarly, you certainly do not have a right to tell people what they view in their own homes, away from you and impressionable minds in society. Viewing pornography in private is and should be legal.
1388	If we assume that humans are artificial, and not a natural phenomenon, then if we could create another being that is capable of being a sentient life form, that being would not be equal to us, no matter how intelligent it may be, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient life forms. If it does achieve those things, it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if it was slower it would still be inferior to us. This would only be the case if we, as "artificial beings" of God our creator, are capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator, and not just ourselves.
1389	I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered for the following reasons: 1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult three times over. 2. The so-called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. 3. His credit card was reported being used after his death. 4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon.
1390	I believe "That's What She Said" is better because "Yo Mama" is just a phrase, "That's What She Said" is not around as much as "Yo Mama", but it is just as clever. "That's What She Said" can be said with anything, and it is a joke, whereas "Yo Mama" is more of an insult to people's actual mothers. Of course, there is a television show on MTV named "Yo Mama", but the show is nothing but retarded people making up sencless jokes about each other's mothers, and they are all different. However, "That's What She Said" can be said to everything and anything, and it is more entertaining. That's all I have to say about that.
1391	The United States has no way of dealing with North Korea when China stands behind them. Any action the United States takes, they can counteract. The only option is to hope the Chinese can reason with them. After all, there is not a more westernized communist nation than China. Sanctions only harm innocent citizens, they do not do much to stop the leaders. Perhaps supplying Japan with nuclear weapons would combat North Korea, and act as a buffer.
1392	Everyone has the right to have their own opinions, to be open about them, and to speak out loud. Similarly, you also have the right to listen to that person, to come back with your own ideas and opinions, or to simply neglect him as if he does not exist (of course, if his ideas are not logical or acceptable)... It is a form of oppression to define to people the way they should think and express themselves.
1393	Pascal's wager is not the best argument for the Christian faith. It is logically coherent, but does not provide any good reasons to believe. However, it has persuaded some people to believe.
1394	Euthanasia should be available to those who would like it. It is a painless way to end life, for both the patient and their families. It is a way for people who are in a lot of pain to go, and be put out of their pain instead of waking up each morning hoping that tomorrow will not be another day.
1395	Trapper was a pretended to be a goofball who got out while the gettin' was good. While he was back in the States starting his private practice, BJ was with Hawkeye until the end. As the war dragged on, and Hawkeye was beginning to lose his mind, did Trapper call to see how they were? No, but BJ was delighting his comrades with home films of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over surgery while Hawkeye was seeing chickens on buses.
1396	I have learned from the "convinceme" pro choice debates that living cells in a mother's womb, though possessing human DNA distinct from the mother, is not human life. The fact that the unborn have a heartbeat and a distinct DNA type does not mean it is human life. The fact that an unborn may have a distinct blood type from the mother, does have a distinct DNA, but the cells are all replicating and living does not equal human life. If none of those things are human life, then what makes anyone reading this human? (take a pass on sentient being and souls and self awareness and all the other quasi mystic nonesense that science and the law don't concern themselves with) We have reasoned ourselves away while rationalizing the atrocity known as abortion.
1397	I would rather be deaf because they can practically cure deafness with a pretty awesome device. You wear a device on the outside of your ear that picks up sound. That device sends this sound to a device that is inserted into your brain. Through a series of neurons, impulses, and electrical things scientific term, you can hear. It is not exact, and it takes months for your brain to "learn" sound, but a lot of deaf people are having these surgeries. They are working on something similar for eyes, but it is much more complicated.
1398	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creationism, while there is massive amounts supporting evolution.
1399	The Cold War is over, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, communist, or dictatorship countries. There are many US bases, farmers, and companies wanting to trade with Cuba which will help open Cuban society as US business take hold on the island along with increased tourism. It is obvious that the current political stance is a failure, there are 48 years of non-change to prove it, a new policy should be established. Why continue with the same old, same old with no change? Jon Jax 71.
1400	I feel that it is a bit much, and should not be sung in school.
1401	I think the worst problem can be when debaters spend a significant amount of time debating about trivial things. We all do it on occasion.
1402	Jon Stewart has a more sophisticated humour style and tends to cover more important issues. He also gets bonus points for being there first. Stephen relies on gimmicky things and has a less sophisticated comedy style. The arrogant act he puts on can be irritating and he's generally not as genuinely funny as Stewart.
1403	I agree, if you only get your news from Fox News, they may be making inaccurate statements such as labeling a Republican sexual predator as Democrat. This alters your reality, however, it can easily be corrected. I suppose the question was meant as in making a person schitzophrenic or dillusional.
1404	This is the first time I've ever given a full review of any restaurant, but I feel that this is warranted. I have visited this location four times since it opened, and the staff has always been courteous and helpful. The chicken has always been fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits have always been perfect, and the dirty rice has always been great. I'm taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and I am considering picking up a large box of chicken to share with the teachers.
1405	I was on a business trip in Phoenix and decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The hostess was very unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. The chips were greasy, the margaritas were made with very little liquor, and the enchiladas were bland. In addition, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom. You could not pay me to go back to this restaurant.
1406	This place has terrible food and horrible service. I will never go back.
1407	We came to celebrate my husband's promotion and we had excellent service. We had the steak Diane and salmon combo, and my husband had shrimp and chicken Alfredo. Additionally, we witnessed the staff accommodating a woman with a visual impairment. Her waitress read the majority of the menu to her until she found something she wanted. She was patient and attentive.
1408	We had the Margherita and the Diavola pizza and both were outstanding. We have been to Naples and had pizza there and the pizza at Inizio is the closest we have been able to find in the U.S. The staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back!
1409	I am giving this place five stars because the other reviews are spot on. Management should read these reviews as most people are spot on.
1410	I really like Jardin Panos. It is not a special place, but it is just your typical Greek restaurant. The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time. The outdoor Terrasse is very cute. Like a lot of people in the area, this is more of a summer destination.
1411	I am not gay, but all the kids at my high school are trying to get a petition signed for uniforms.
1412	Another argument against school uniforms is that they deprive children of their individuality. The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, which is vital in human nature.
1413	Kids do not want to wear the same clothes everyday. I know I would hate it.
1414	In my personal opinion, school uniforms are not a good idea. Adults are always telling us to be ourselves and express who we really are, but we cannot do that while wearing a stupid uniform to school!
1415	I do not think it is a good idea to keep restrictions because that will only make students, especially teenagers, more hungry for fashion. It is better to feed them than keep them hungry. Once they are away from these restrictions, we will see the other side of them, which is worse. Allow people to be free with their personalities instead of stopping them.
1416	Firefox has nothing to do with Apple or Steve Jobs. I would say you are a fanatical zealot.
1417	Mozilla Firefox is more efficient than Internet Explorer in that it alerts you to blocked pop-ups, and automatically updates the older version to the latest version, as well as the Google Toolbar, and it downloads very quickly.
1418	Internet Explorer uses a lot of memory when running multiple tabs.
1419	I would advise those on this side of the debate to keep their secrets from their spouses, and if they discover the truth on their own, leave them alone.
1420	While television has certain benefits, books are better overall for learning, as they require more focus.
1421	Television is similar to books, the only difference is that you have to move your eyes for books.
1422	The United States fought the British during their independence struggle and every time an American saw a British soldier, they would yell "The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming." Similarly, if India ever attempted to takeover the United States, Americans would be forced to yell "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming."
1423	I think it is better to be fatherless, because even though I would have someone to look up to, I would rather have a bad father.
1424	I would rather be fatherless than have a bad father. A father is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. If I look up to a bad father, I might then be a bad person. If I had no father, then I would set the standards for myself and step up to be the man of the house, especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
1425	I think it is better to have no father than a bad father. Either way you still lose.
1426	Farquhar was a subordinate of Raffles, not the one who signed the treaty with Sultan Hussein.
1427	The Singapore Treaty was signed between Raffles, Sultan Hussein, and the Temenggong with seven ships witnessing the event.
1428	How is it that evolution is true, and man kind is currently not evolving? For those of you with religion, Adam and Eve were the first human race to walk on this planet. In Arabic, the word "man" means "bani adam," which literally means the tribe of Adam.
1429	From a casual internet user, I prefer Internet Explorer because it has a more sleek design and is easier to use the bookmark/history feature. However, I am using Firefox because my brother made it my default browser.
1430	Kids are overweight these days; physical activity helps. It will also help them realize that health is important for their future.
1431	I believe it should be mandatory. When you look on the streets at kids playing, they are most likely overweight because they eat too much and do not get enough physical exercise.
1432	Farquhar did the ground work to improve Singapore, while Raffles only dreamed about what to do.
1433	Without William Farquhar, Singapore would have perished. William Farquhar was there to govern the country. Raffles left to govern another country.
1434	Until you have experienced the struggles these girls/women have encountered, you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. While you may not agree with them, you should at least have the courage to respect their opinions.
1435	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit flies are quite useful for this experiment since they breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations, and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. i.e. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different environment. If you look, you can see evolution.
1436	We were created in a few days or our outcome was processed over billions of years. Which do you think is more realistic?
1437	The weak die, the strong continue to breed. This strengthens the species. Argument over. However, creationism and evolution are not exclusionary. I do not believe in a god simply because of the unbelievably minute chance of a god (or gods) existing.
1438	I disagree that pornography is a healthy way to live. I would wager that all those who agree that pornography is morally wrong are virgins.
1439	Pornography is not wrong. While some people think it is, it is not. Without sex, how would we have children?
1440	Advancing the common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit is only for selfish people who only care about themselves.
1441	I believe advancing the common good is better because it helps out the community. However, my personal pursuit will be better because I know that if I do not go to college after high school then I will not go at all, so I would choose my personal pursuit.
1442	I believe it is best to advance towards the common good, but it does not really exist in this world. Most people are greedy, selfish, and only care about what they want. I believe everyone has a small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.
1443	I think uniforms are good, but only if they are used properly. For example, when I went to school with a uniform, it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. It also prevents people from showing off material wealth. However, it can be used too far. For example, at the end, we were not allowed colored socks, which was ridiculous.
1444	It is good to follow school rules and the right to express emotions, however, it is not necessary as we have come to school for learning.
1445	I believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you do not have to constantly worry about what you are going to wear every morning. This time can be used to do other important things which will help you in lessons. Yes, it may be a bit boring wearing the same set of clothes, but it is less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.
1446	I believe that such a policy is a good idea because uniforms make students equal on an economic level. This can prevent envy and jealousy.
1447	Having a bad father would be better than being fatherless. If you have a bad father you can learn from his mistakes and avoid them. Also, being fatherless would be hard on you and your mother. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father there to lend you a hand.
1448	I believe it is better to have a bad father than be fatherless. I know what it is like to not have a father, so in my opinion, it would be better to have a bad father than no father at all. For some people, having a bad father is like having no father.
1449	It is costly, wasteful, and distracts from the most important aspect of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems.
1450	Water bottles are bad because they cause pollution. Also, some people sell water bottles that have bacteria in them depending on where they get the water from. Water bottles also cost more than tap water.
1451	Can people please explain why TV is superior to books? At our school we are doing a debate. Can you please provide some assistance?
1452	Why would we ban a product that is purchased by more than one million people when we are in a recession?
1453	The most interesting man in the world is drinking bottled water when he is not drinking Dos Equis.
1454	I do not know about you, but water bottles are very convenient. When I am at the beach on a hot summer day and I am dehydrated, I have two options. Pass out from the heat and lack of water and waste the rest of my day sick or in the hospital, or drink out of a water bottle.
1455	I apologize if the last comment was placed on the wrong side.
1456	Of course it is wrong. Why do you think that Aids exists?
1457	Is marriage all about love? If it were, then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle school could get married as well.
1458	I think (and this is a wild guess) that the original argument the person was attempting to make was that unprotected sex can increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission. That might be true. But if it is, it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
1459	I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them. A law requiring separate schools and public accommodations for homosexual people would violate "separate but equal." However, a law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.
1460	India has the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states and 28 ways, culture, geography, and language, it certainly can lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur, while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically, India isn't that low.
1461	I am a Christian and very religious, but if this argument is the qualifying factor, I am going with Atheism. God is not Christian.
1462	If God loves everyone, then why does he hate homosexuals? The Bible is just a book; have you ever wondered if the cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "god" appear better?
1463	After a spanking, I made sure I never did it again to avoid punishment. The second time is always worse because you were told not to do it before.
1464	I believe parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but they should not use it every time they make a mistake.
1465	Though I behave as an atheist, I do not forget the principles and norms of Christianity. As this argument has heated up, it is better to conclude that this trend of atheism has not really gained traction, and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion while proclaiming to support atheism.
1466	You'd rather die believing in God, than not believing and finding out he exists.
1467	Spanking is mostly out of anger, and can be for more than what your kid did. For example, if someone else made them mad, they let it all out on them.
1468	I think parents should not spank their children because there are other methods to get the same result.
1469	It is unnecessary and quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who become terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
1470	The same principle applies when you hit someone, then you are told not to hit someone, then told not to hit, then hit by the same person.
1471	I would turn them in. That is crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime. I do not care who you are to me or what you mean to me. I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person, you may also go to jail for the crime, and I do not want to go to jail.
1472	I would report a murder if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone. Murder is premedicated and intentional, so you never know if they will turn on you later.
1473	I would turn in my wife because it is wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident but it was still wrong. The police are going to find out who killed that person. I do not want my wife to leave me for a long period of time. So, I would either tell them or I would not.
1474	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files, the individual that is always involved with the murderer is always caught. I do not want to be the one caught. Additionally, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too insane for me, so I would break up with her.
1475	I would most likely turn my husband in, because I do not want to marry a murderer. Additionally, if my husband killed someone else, then who knows if his next attack will be on me? Obviously he is disturbed by committing murder, and that is not who I want to spend my life with.
1476	Sport should not be compulsory. Many children get bullied in PE because they are overweight or unfit. Bullies pick their victims each day in PE. You guys on the affirmative team are wrong.
1477	I am in school and P.E. makes kids unhappy. A lot of people get sad because they are chosen last and can't play. For example, I hate P.E. class and I am always the last to be chosen for the teams. It isn't cool. Additionally, not only obese kids but also obese adults have done P.E. and it did not help them in any way.
1478	P.E. should be optional in eighth grade. If students want to participate, that should be the case. However, in eighth grade students have a lot going on. That time may be better used by studying.
1479	The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. This is to reduce the number of poorly thought out jokes, thereby increasing the quality of debate and discourse.
1480	Physical education is simply too tiring, so it is the reason why physical education should not be compulsory. The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. This restriction is intended to cut down on the number of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
1481	Some children cannot take PE because they are already in athletics or are training very hard.
1482	I am not pleased with the idea of an increased Physical Education requirement. First, I think that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. I believe that students have the responsibility to choose whether or not to work out. Also, I say that there should not be any Physical Education requirement in college. In my opinion, college is a place to train our brains, not our bodies. Additionally, if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as I do. I go hiking and play basketball in my neighborhood.
1483	It is easier to help yourself than it is to help others. Additionally, not all people want to be helped. Your needs are more important than others. You need to pursue your personal goals first. In this world, you have to fight for what you want.
1484	In my opinion, if you are not helping yourself, you cannot help anyone else. If you try to help everyone that needs your help, you will just slow yourself down. Don't get me wrong, helping people is always right. In the end, if you pursue your dreams and get rich, fame, and power, you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
1485	I believe that human nature is to pursue things for self-interest, not for the benefit of others.
1486	The person who threw away the cup is out immediately. The person who helped roll the rim down should not have a leg to stand on, unless an agreement was made by the finder of the cup. If your neighbor asked for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigarettes, and a lottery ticket, do you deserve half of the winnings? Probably not. Therefore, I would have to say the finder deserves the prize.
1487	You need to try and get the money. The hospital bills can be paid in full by the hospitals billing department. All you need to do is put a statement in writing stating you can not pay the bill. Most hospitals will clear the account. That is most hospitals, not all will. But it is worth it. If you have no means to pay for it, then you do not. My father just passed away and he had not a toilet to even use. I thought once I went to the showing they would try and get me.
1488	Being a Christian means forgiveness, but you should not suffer due to the poor decisions of others. If you do plan to sue, make sure you sue for only the exact amount in medical bills and lost income. Make sure you have receipts for everything. It is not unethical to sue if you are only in it for exact compensation.
1489	You have the right to ask for sole custody if you feel that he is causing your daughter more harm than good. This can be difficult to prove, especially if there has never been a court order as far as visitation is concerned. If he does not follow the visitation times, the judge will presume that he is giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. This may take some time. As far as child support is concerned, he will be subject to back child support from the day your daughter is born unless he can prove that he was paying. You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support payment/custody documents. It is not hard to fill out and they will assist you in doing them. The more information you have about your daughter's father the better, i.e. job information, social security, drivers license, address, etc.
1490	I agree that legalizing marijuana would free up a lot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for non-violent crimes, and I believe it would cause a lot less people to use harder drugs! Additionally, people who need it for medical reasons would not have to go through all the garbage they need to now for relief!
1491	I am not sure what your question is about. Petitions are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a lot of people willing to sign it via email or otherwise. However, a petition is not a legal document. It is merely an attempt to get a certain number of people to act in favor of a particular issue. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that does not mean that smoking will be banned. However, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might want to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.
1492	God has never stated that looking at a naked woman is against His laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states that lusting after a woman in your thoughts is the same as lusting after her in person. It is much easier to lust after a naked woman than a dressed woman. So, while it is not against God's law, it is not a good idea.
1493	If your father's insurance goes up, you should pay it. It will probably get reviewed within six months. However, the good news is that you got a ticket for improper passing, which is no big deal. She got a ticket because she was half to blame at least. Let's assume there is a big doctor bill. You are probably insured on your father's policy had you been at fault. Your friend has the problem and he is totally at fault. He let you use the car. Now, if there is a claim, he is not insured because he did not list you as a separate driver, and he might have to pay out of his pocket. This is his problem, not yours. I do not see this as an ethical problem for you because you are insured.
1494	It must have hurt you deeply to think that you were holding back someone you loved. However, I do not think you are. If he is not worried, I would not either. His boss needs to keep up with the times and realize that homosexuals, interracial couples, lesbians, and most relationships are commonplace. I am sure if he keeps pushing your boyfriend, he will make a decision to find another firm rather than lose you. Good luck.
1495	I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics. Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up. This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution. To really properly analyze these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there). The statistics for African-Americans are even worse - something like 6000+ African-American inmates per 100,000.
1496	There is no requirement to videotape your FST's. Since most departments do not have in-car cameras, I do not think they "forgot" to tape your FST's. Your license is done and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you were not drunk, you should have taken the breathalyser. However, people do not usually make sound decisions when they are drunk.
1497	You want to teach this person a lesson, but those are not good legal grounds for a lawsuit. You will never find an attorney to take this kind of case on contingency. So, if you really want to pursue this you will have to do it out of pocket, which will be obscenely expensive. If your reputation was not harmed, then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, and let it go.
1498	A person listed as "payable on death" has no interest in your account while you are still alive. They will only get any assets left when you die, they are not on the hook for any liabilities -- certainly not while you're alive. Let them know you will get a lawyer if they do not change their tune -- and that it will cost them more than $800. Bank stealing money from innocent children? Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.
1499	It is very difficult to get sole custody. You have to PROVE that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail sounds bad, but since she is in jail, she cannot be doing anything harmful. (In the courts' point of view) Fighting this will be tough. You would be better off trying to change visitation. Try to get it that it has to be supervised. I would go talk to a lawyer. The first consultation is usually free. (And custody battles can be expensive).
1500	I am sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assault. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesn't help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse.
1501	If you purchased the dog in Florida and you have resided here together or separately for over a year, then the courts in Florida would have jurisdiction over this case. You can retain an attorney to file your claim here in Florida and have her served with papers out in California. If the dog is registered in your name, I do not foresee a problem with you getting the dog back. Good Luck.
1502	I am in favor of lowering the drinking age to 18. I am 31, mother of two girls, and a health teacher. I would definitely vote it back in.
1503	I am not sure if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to specific groups. I know that many people that were born south of the United States may speak the same way because Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have a similar accent. However, not all "Latinos" are the same. For example, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different from one another. Culture should not be an excuse to do something wrong. When you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that is a poor excuse.
1504	The problem with this form of punishment is that it does not remove the mental drive of the perpetrator. He will still have the same thoughts. Perhaps a combination of frontal lobotomy and castration will do the trick, but I do not see any State passing this into law. I am more in favor of the two strikes and your shot approach. Besides, bullets are so much cheaper than surgery.
1505	Is this your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself? Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social "harmony" or "balance." Therefore, we cannot dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance. The process of defining social harmony and balance is socially cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is. In other words, the process of accepting and agreeing on laws, customs, or religion is socially cohesive.
1506	The unfortunate thing about this is that there are many innocent people who are displaced, looking for jobs (which our state does not have due to the economy and crime), and have no permanent place to call home.
1507	I am not sure, however, I think that people lie in court all the time. People are either honest or dishonest... I do not think that swearing to tell the truth will automatically make a dishonest person want to tell the truth... It just means that if they do not tell the truth when they swore to, then it is illegal. And hey, if they are already on trial for something illegal, it's probably not going to bother them if they do something ELSE that is illegal.
1508	You should fight for your rights, and not allow him to have sex with you (charge him, I just wanted to say that). The most important thing is the welfare of your children, and documentation. I hope you have documentation of everything that has happened in your life, and witnesses. He has to pay child support, no matter what. He is their father and has to support them (like it or not/wage garnishment). Do not question yourself if you need financial help, you do and you deserve it. Good luck.
1509	I believe when you get to a point where you can't move to get something or do something yourself, or have a very hard time doing it, you are too fat. My father weighs 600 pounds and he can't even walk anymore. It is not a criminal act, although it is one of the seven deadly sins of the bible known as glutiny. No one else can be held responsible for someone eating themselves to death. Cause even if someone else is giving them the food, they pretty much have to feed them til they are full, or it won't let them rest at all. p.s. I am a big guy too, but I am perfectly capable of doing everything anyone else does with a lot of ease. I work a factory job and work twelve and sixteen hours a day and can't lose weight for the life of me, I do not consume that much food. Some people are naturally heavy, and those are the most misunderstood.
1510	It is no different if I walk into my house and my only child is lying dead on the floor and I discover that my beautiful wife has been raped. As I walk into the room he drops his knife and tells me that he is giving up because I have a gun in my hand.
1511	This is not an easy question to answer. In general, a parent may use "reasonable force" in disciplining a minor child. However, what is "reasonable" from one situation to another may vary greatly.
1512	I do not understand why we should legalize murder, fraud, robbery, and rape. Using marijuana is illegal, and just because millions of people do it does not make it right. Millions of people around the world supported the 911 attacks, does that make them right?
1513	I may not know everything, but from my experience people are too busy to see what Bushy (please do not sue me because I just said "Bushy" instead of Bushy, I like the name like that) is doing. Also, people are sometimes too poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper. Or they're just too lazy too.
1514	The families of the victims are appalled that their loved one will never see another holiday, birthday, or even just one more day, with their murderer still alive. It brings a measure of relief to the families. There is something inherently fair about executing a murderer.
1515	This type of question only reinforces the view of anti-gunners about how they view legal gun-owners. Your question should be, "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?" or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?"
1516	Here are a few suggestions: 1. Do not cover his hate-mongering on the daily news. The whole reason that "church" keeps going is because they get publicity. Complain to TV stations that cover them. 2. If you are at a funeral or event where they are present, either tell them how much their actions hurt and offend you, or stand in front of them with your back to them. You have the right to do this from the First Amendment, just like they do. 3. Support organizations, such as PFLAG, who work against discrimination, bigotry, and homophobia. Support the same causes yourself. I tried to limit my answer to things an individual can do, vs. staging a counterdemonstration and other things that require lots of people and money. Thanks for your thoughtful question.
1517	I am still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non-smokers have had their non-smoking areas with fans. I guess not. People just want to dictate what others do so they can get their way. If non-smokers right was seemingly violated, they would and do get their way. What about smokers' rights?
1518	The United Nations was against the war in the first place, Bush made this stupid meaningless war, it was an unnecessary war. Maybe that is why the world is watching to see the mess the US made and how they are trying to fix it. Bush will never admit it was a terrible mistake going there and starting this war. I agree, however, that if all of the world helped, the insurgents and terrorists would be eliminated. That is not going to happen because I would guess 90% of the world hates the US, especially now.
1519	If someone wants to be racist, then by all means let him be racist. There are worse things a person could be.
1520	If you are asking for yourself, I would say that is pathetic. You want to sue a bar because you were arrested for public intoxication? What did they do? Hold you down, pour tequila down your throat, and make you turn into a jerk? I would love to sit on that jury...someday I hope you are able to practice some personal responsibility.
1521	In my opinion, the government should have the right to step in when it is in the best interest of society as a whole.
1522	I am having trouble finding anything positive about this decade. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful that I have food, shelter, and a good job, but there isn't a lot to look positively at.
1523	In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Everything in society, such as wealth, income, education, and so on is just there to make our lives appear meaningful. They do not exist in the physical world. Hunter and gatherers do not need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Okay, they may have shorter life expectancy. So what? There is no philosophical explanation on why life has to be long. The fact is that we, civilians, have to create allusions to make our lives content.
1524	I do not understand why people with a degree in historical studies do not do anything else than teach younger persons or write historical texts. I do not understand why it is so highly regarded though it is all for our enjoyment.
1525	If we stay in this location for the next 11-12 years, I will likely purchase a Dodge Charger or a Crown Victoria. It will have a roof-rack shaped like their siren lights, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram-cage on the front, and possibly some numbers on the back. I do not plan to write anything on the side, but I will make sure I slap on everything I can. We do not live in a dangerous city/area and we never plan to be anywhere near one, so I do not see him taunting criminals. I think he will bring intimidation to every neighborhood he goes to and people will drive carefully and slowly around him.
1526	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times in a row I have been threatened with violence less than two minutes from my dorm. Once I was able to diffuse the situation by showing a knife, once I was able to drive off, and the final time I was lucky to be saved by campus police. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I believe that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying, but statistics have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without licenses.
1527	From a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism is beginning to look like a group of upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior. While leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched.
1528	I know that the frontmen of 90's grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols, but let's take a look at them. Kurt Cobain is very attractive, blonde and blue eyed. Eddie Vedder is also very attractive, Scott Weiland was also very handsome, Chris Cornell was not as good looking as he used to be, but I am not sure if he is good looking now. Layne Staley was also not as bad looking as he used to be. Is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen?
1529	I watched the Spider-Man movies when I was six and saw absolutely nothing wrong with them. After watching them again ten years later, I thought that Toby could seem a bit mopey, but I do not understand why there is so much aggression toward the actor. He was decent in the great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? People on the internet constantly complain about his various faces, but I have only noticed the one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please elaborate.
1530	I will add some arguments here, but please do not feel obligated to address them point by point. There is plenty of stuff I've probably missed/gotten.
1531	I will explain how I came to this conclusion: I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number. I answered the phone and was led to believe I was speaking with a person. Then, a famous politician began to bombard me with politically correct language which was not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. While this may be annoying, it does not appear to be illegal. The implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic propaganda to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for. I could write more of my opinion, but I really want to be wrong. Thanks.
1532	The first step is to determine how much sugar is in an 8 ounce glass of Arizona Iced Tea, Coca-Cola Classic, and Pepsi. Then, we compare the first two ingredients of each drink: water and high fructose corn syrup. Then, we determine that Arizona gets its flavor mostly from tea leaves while Coke gets its flavor from flavoring. Then, we determine that they both stain teeth; Coke has caramel color while Arizona gets its color from tea leaves. I like both drinks, but I feel that they are both pretty terrible at this point and that they should only be used sparingly.
1533	I have read that America spends three times as much on special education students as on normal students in the classroom. I find it puzzling that special education students receive one or two teachers who personally teach them, and a large amount of new high tech equipment in their classrooms, while many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while special education students each have individual tablets. I am open to rebutting this argument, but if anyone can refute this argument, I'm open to changing my mind.
1534	I believe that if they vote for independence they should get complete independence. This would include a full and immediate cease of all funding from the UK government to Scotland and Scottish nationals, immigration controls, them not being allowed to use the pound, be expelled from the UN/NATO (and have to reapply to join if they want to). They seem to be like petulant kids that are biting the hand that feeds them.
1535	I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. The majority of comments praised the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. In my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs who should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred.
1536	I am generally against capital punishment for moral reasons for almost every reason other than crimes against humanity. I believe killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I do not think capital punishment is moral for other heinous crimes such as murder or rape in practically every circumstance. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion and so I'm willing to change my mind. I'm hoping to hear an argument that is different from the usual argument that points out how bad some examples are.
1537	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" is whether or not one believes that a woman should have the option of terminating her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions.
1538	I am completely against pirating content online. Most people seem to feel it is harmless since you are stealing from big companies like Fox or EA, but those are just the producers, not the actual company that created the content and deserves the money they worked hard to earn. The Pirate Bay does not attempt to hide that it's soul purpose is to circulate torrented files of copy righted content. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his involvement in both creating the site, and developing methods to make it harder for the site to be taken down is entirely justified.
1539	In general, it is appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "Your Honor," or "Captain." However, in certain situations it is considered disrespectful not to refer to a person by their honorifics/titles. For example, a Duke may be referred to as "King" but a doctor may be referred to as "Prince." There are two reasons why the system of nobility is historically oppressive and unfair. Therefore, nobility is completely unearned and should not be referred to by its honorifics.
1540	It is not that our generation puts money over people, it is simply that our generation has learned from its past that people are not forever. People die, people leave, people change, and most importantly, people can't always be there for you. Point blank. All you have is yourself, your goals, your hobbies, and your interests. The problem is, goals, hobbies, and interests cost money. You better be making enough to do what you enjoy most. Being lonely and broke is worse than being lonely but making enough to see the movies you want to see and take the trips you want to take. You have to make enough to keep your own life going so you won't stay stuck in the past.
1541	Opera is a great browser, but it is not well known.
1542	While I believe both baseball and football are deeply rooted in America's history, I believe baseball is America's number one pastime.
1543	I care about it as much as I care about the regular flu, which is to say, "not at all." As is often the case, common precautions such as washing one's hands regularly, using non-antibacterial soap, sneezing into tissues or handkerchiefs, and simply staying home when you feel sick would go a long way toward ending this "epidemic."
1544	There is no way to argue against the fact that many fundamentalist Muslim's state they hate the US because we are not Muslim. Whether or not they would be bombing or attacking US interests in the Mid East is more easily argued because of US support for Israel and meddling in Mid-east politic.
1545	I am sorry to say this to all the Giants fans, but I think that the Eagles won 23-11. Also, with Brian Westbrook and Donovan McNabb being healthy, as well as their helpers such as Desean Jackson and Kevin Curtis, the offense will be hard to stop next season. Also, with their dominant defense, with people like Asante Samuel and their new additions, it will be like pick Paluza with the Eagles. Lastly, they have defensive linemen like Jeramiah Trotter and other people that could kill any quarterback they see. Eagles out.
1546	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfill some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most disgusting act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant. This is "evil". However, where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this is a form of masochism.
1547	Since I do not believe in the Big Bang theory and that God created all per Genesis, I must say that God created photosynthesis. For those of you who disagree, I wonder how likely you think photosynthesis evolved. Something as complex as that process occurred by accident? Things like this make me wonder why we cannot all believe in a supreme creator.
1548	The fix is in, just like in boxing and wrestling. The NFL and baseball are no exception. Sports are a business, first and foremost and entertainment second. Look at the WNBA. Now they are allowing sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys. Stern will do the same for the NBA real soon. College sports are the biggest revenue producer for them as well. Athletes get very little pay and no contracts which is why they are jumping to the pros from high school.
1549	I do not understand the point of the open platform. Game producers will have an easier time developing games, but I do not understand why people would buy one box and then have an "Xbox", "Playstation", and "Nintendo" station for it. The three big competitors in this industry would be strapped to one box, making money off of their interfaces? Compared to third-party producers, the three companies very few games so it seems like there would be a substantial loss of profit for the giants. I want to see the competition, competition is what keeps the hardware advancing and taking everything to next-gen.
1550	Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education was forced to have fees, people in poverty would not be able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper.
1551	Elvis's music is known worldwide and even though he has passed away his music is still played often. His music is found in many stores that sell music. Even though some people do not like all of his music it is still likely that they know one of his songs.
1552	The engineering process category in SPICE is more helpful in designing or assessing processes of typical projects developing software-intensive systems. It explains the relationship of tests to requirements and integration tests to architecture and design much more clearly than CMMI. Additionally, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.
1553	This topic is very interesting. I agree, it could reasonably happen. Look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country. When Tiananmen Square happened, there was a reaction all over the world. While there were not mass riots, there were strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports. The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these.
1554	Trucks are more useful because you can haul and tow things, but they also have the power and capability to haul yourself out of the ditch that you might accidentally drive yourself into whilst talking on the telephone. Additionally, there are many trucks (such as the Dodge Ram SRT10) that are fast enough to keep up with many cars.
1555	I wish my President would have specified where the 200 or so prisoners were going to go instead of Guantanamo Bay. If he had, pending where they would go, I would be more inclined to agree. However, with the waterboarding incidents that a lot of people call torture and the whole "Its Cuba's property not ours!" business alone, I think the base should stay open. However, I am only 19 and I have never been to Guantanamo Bay. I have never been in the armed forces or personally dealt with the terrorists, so this opinion of mine isn't based on much.
1556	I believe it is reasonable to be afraid of Islam, as it contains many verses of peace, but these verses are contradicted by later verses of war. Additionally, while many wars are fought for religion, Islam is the only religion that calls for violence in its Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.
1557	I am new to this website, so please be gentle with me. Saga was ahead of its time, which is why it did not sell as well as Nintendo or Playstation. The Saga Dreamcast was the best system of its time, and it had CDs before any other system. The Game Gear system was also great, and was ahead of its time. I would love to see Saga make a comeback, and bring Sonic back home.
1558	I have had three debates in a row where people have criticized my views on upholding convinceme's seriousness. Convinceme is the sole administrator of this website. What he says goes. But he has left us as a community to make our own decisions. I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve. I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions.
1559	The credit should go to the troops. Obama signed off on it, but he had no involvement in it.
1560	I really dislike Vegas but restaurants like Mesa make it bearable.
1561	The food was good, but the second waiter was not friendly or helpful.
1562	I have been to this place before and it is very popular, but the service is slow and the food is not very good.
1563	I was not impressed with this place. My coworkers raved about it, but I found the turkey sandwich to be passable. The food was decent, and the service was adequate. This place is a chain, so it may not be as different as you think it would be.
1564	This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. Our food order was lost, and after two hours, we finally received our food. The manager was very accommodating and comped our meals. However, they needed another $30 because they had already taken all of the money off the gift cards. I will let all of my friends know about this.
1565	The food was great, but the service was slow.
1566	I like fried fish, so I tried it. It was a cheap meal, but it wasn't very good.
1567	School uniforms are a bad idea. Kids will not be able to show their individuality.
1568	I know I will miss the days when I was a student.
1569	I have always maintained that wearing a uniform to school is a good idea. Why not? It looks nice and respectful. This shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school because it made me feel like a schoolgirl and well dressed.
1570	I do not agree with the arguments presented for why IE is superior.
1571	I cannot beat the amazing skins that allow me to personalize my browser.
1572	I dislike IE because it makes developing difficult. I do not like having to make separate stylesheets for IE.
1573	I would not turn them in to the police. I would hope that the police catch them, but I would not say anything. I would tell them to turn themselves in.
1574	All television shows are written in script form, which is a form of book.
1575	Books are better than TV because they have more detail and are easier to remember.
1576	Having a bad father does more than damage the physical body. It alters a person's confidence and self esteem. It can also instil bad habits in a child.
1577	I would rather be fatherless than have a lousy father. The reason is that I would not want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is at being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's simple. I either have a good father or I do not have a father at all. Even though he is still in the house, I would not call him my father.
1578	I think it is better to be fatherless than have a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother.
1579	Raffles left important plans and policies for the development of Singapore.
1580	The definition of founder was discussed in class that day, that founder is not the person who discovers the place, but he is the key in the development of the place. It may have been Farquhar who suggested this to Raffles.
1581	Pornography is wrong because it is not good. If it were, then it would be even worse.
1582	Biblically, yes, it is wrong. Additionally, it can become an addiction that destroys lives, similar to drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.
1583	Pornography is wrong. I don't understand why people film naked girls and distribute it on the internet. It is only there because it makes money and stupid people like it. Try watching it in front of your family, friends, or younger youth. You would feel uncomfortable. Why? Because common sense and your conscience.
1584	What do you see in porn? Sex, what is sex for? Making a baby, why should you watch others make a baby? Pleasure, what causes pleasure? Temptation, what do you do to control temptation? Then do it. Conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there is a temptation to increase the population of the next generation.
1585	You cannot argue with the theory of creatoinism without getting into an extremely dumb argument because anybody who believes in creatoinism who is arguing with anyone who does not can say that God makes them think what they think. Take a hint, everyone. This argument is ridiculous.
1586	I prefer IE7 on Vista because it runs in a secure context with minimal access to your computer and private information. Firefox and IE are internet facing applications with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
1587	Yes, because some children do not understand anything except physical education, especially rich children of wealthy parents.
1588	Raffles came and left Singapore frequently, while Farquar remained constant and resolved many problems. Raffles' actions were not comparable to Farquar's actions.
1589	Although Raffles was the head of the operation, it is Farquhar who developed Singapore into what it is today.
1590	William took the initiative to understand the locals and to communicate with them. He even learned Malay so that conversation would be easier.
1591	It is not illegal to commit suicide everywhere. Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision to the woman and her God. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.
1592	I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to prove that we are not evolving. I have not made any such assertions. Until you can back up your claim that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer.
1593	The peppered moths experiment is an example of an invalid experiment. However, other experiments and observations do not show an absence of evolution.
1594	There are many different ways to date things using radiometric techniques. The fact that they are independent, observable, and falsifiable makes them a scientific method. I would recommend going to www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html for more information on radiometric dating.
1595	Pornography does not kill anybody. It is a profitable source of entertainment for some. Can somebody really tell me what is wrong with it without bringing their moral standards into the argument?
1596	I do not feel degraded by porn. You do not like it? Do not watch it. There are more important jobs in life than being my personal morality police.
1597	Having a chance to better the common good comes around once in a lifetime. You have to consider that you can improve the lives of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself, which is the greatest benefit of all.
1598	I think it is a good idea to have uniforms so students do not have to worry about what to wear. It is also a good idea to teach students how to dress correctly, because if we let them dress themselves, they could wear inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans, or sexy clothes, which is not good for their minds.
1599	It is better to have a bad father than no father at all. Fathers provide not only food and shelter but they also protect their children.
1600	I say lousy if by lousy you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad. However, if your pops is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc... Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.
1601	There are direct links between bottled water and certain types of disease, including cancer.
1602	Television is far superior due to its wider variety of things to do. Some people say that television is incontinent, but now you can watch television on a smart phone, which is very convenient.
1603	A picture is worth a thousand words, television allows you to see and hear a story, or information. Imagine just reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama, and Missouri compared to seeing them and hearing interviews with survivors. Much more powerful and immediate on television. Books take too much time, television gives the information much faster.
1604	Without television you would not know what is happening in the world. The newspapers cannot fit that information in. Books and newspapers cannot give you emergency warnings, updates, or new flashes.
1605	Western Europe consumes almost 50% of the world's bottled water. This is due to European culture, since the continent has had very polluted waters due to agriculture and industry dating back to the Industrial Revolution. The water bottles they buy help us.
1606	Craig is a hypocrite when it comes to bottled water. He should not be taken seriously.
1607	Plastic is recyclable and can make new objects such as more plastic bottles, so reusing the same plastic bottle over and over again will not hurt the economy.
1608	The Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together to develop the National School Beverage Guidelines in 2006, which resulted in a 58% reduction in total calories contained in all beverages shipped to schools. Additionally, a survey was taken of parents, pediatricians, and family physicians, the highest supported choice for each group was bottled water.
1609	The real issue is why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it. Then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation.
1610	Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and woman to populate the earth. How can the human species survive if they are only attracted to each other? Obviously not.
1611	Homosexuals are overrated and it is another way to get attention. I think homosexuals are a result of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness. If you stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1612	I am a passionate Christian who believes that gay marriage is wrong. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should adhere to those beliefs.
1613	David, the reason people from your country come to India for peace and to get rid of depression, is because we are geniuses and intellectually superior. In the past we have led the world and we will surely lead the world again in the near future.
1614	India has the potential to lead the world. It has natural resources, a highly spiritual population, and a country with diverse languages and races. India has the potential to flourish. However, the government seems corrupt and poverty still exists.
1615	You are saying that only India has these things, but other countries do not. Does America, which seems to be leading the world, have bad qualities? It eats less and wastes more. The amount of food they waste could be utilized to feed the entire Indian population. It causes more pollution. Blame us.
1616	The theory of intelligent design is nothing more than Christian mysticism disguised as science.
1617	Religion has caused many wars in the past. It encourages racism, sexism, and homophobia. It causes us prejudice, and makes us hate one another. It is time to put an end to it.
1618	I believe spanking should only be used as a last resort. I am one of three siblings and was spanked along with my sister. We both ended up being disciplined. On the other hand, our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes now that she is 10.
1619	Yes, so they can provide a reason for the children not to engage in the activity again.
1620	Yes, because then they will not do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. However, there is a line that a parent should not cross, such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
1621	It is acceptable for a parent to spank a child, provided it is not often or they do not use other things such as a belt.
1622	Atheists rely on proof even though they have none. If my religion has no proof, then that gives your religion proof? That doesn't make sense. What does the atheist have to back up their beliefs? Evolution? Everyone knows that evolution isn't very reliable.
1623	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment such as spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, and if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child, and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide, although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know what is best for them.
1624	Some children do not learn by being spanked, so why waste your time on that when you can always take something valuable away from them?
1625	I would answer in the affirmative. There is no reason to kill someone and then claim it was a mistake. That is not right. I do not care what others say about whether it was a mistake or not.
1626	I would report him to the police because it is wrong to kill someone for any reason. If he kills one person then he may kill me. People want to know what happened to their loved ones so they can be at peace knowing that the person responsible paid for what he did.
1627	If you knew the victim, you would turn him in immediately. If it was a stranger, then it would be more difficult. If he killed someone who was harming us, then I would consider turning him in. I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also think about the possibility that he thinks I will say something and then kills me as well.
1628	I would turn in my husband because that is plain wrong. I would explain, "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?". For doing a wrong and becoming better, you have to take your consequences.
1629	If you kill someone, then you should do the right thing and turn yourself in. It would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they committed a horrible crime and they should pay for it.
1630	If someone is raped and becomes pregnant, they should have the choice of having an abortion or not. However, if people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Otherwise, people will abuse their power to chose and will be killing children because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
1631	One word: adoption. There is absolutely no reason to receive an abortion when you could continue through to birth and then put the child up for adoption. This is commonly ignored in the abortion debate, but I think it is by far the best choice.
1632	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously haven't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
1633	That is a very rare occurrence and can usually be countered with a contraceptive drug if the woman seeks medical attention following the assault.
1634	Core classes are more important, kids should be more focused on learning, and competitiveness can cause bullying.
1635	Tax payers do not realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the entire hour.
1636	If students do not have a physical education class, the obesity rate will go even higher than it is now. That is one reason why physical education reduces heart failure, improved physical fitness, weight reduction, self discipline, and stress reduction.
1637	Why should it matter? If two people, regardless of gender, love each other to the point of marriage, shouldn't that follow what the bible really teaches us? All you bible nutjobes are making me sick. The bible teaches love and forgiveness.
1638	Gay people do not have the same rights as heterosexual people.
1639	It may be against the teachings of the bible, etc., but it is because a homosexual relationship bears no children. This is why it was banned. Also, it was seen to weaken the position of men. Time has changed. It is time to accept.
1640	I believe personal pursuit is better because it is your job to decide what you want to do with your life. You are not always going to have someone by your side telling you what is right or wrong. It is all on you of reaching your goals. It is also a good thing to help other reach and succeed in their goals.
1641	I feel that it is better to do both, but first you need to help yourself.
1642	Although we have free speech in America, if our speech incites riots or if it is reasonable to assume that what you say could incite others to do harm or break the law, then there can be legal repercussions. The reason this so seldom happens is that it has to be proved that the actions of others were the direct and sole result of the words or actions of another, which can be hard to do.
1643	If what you say is true, and you are speaking about a reasonable amount of time, then you are probably fine. However, how you say it can be viewed as an unjustified verbal assault, which, depending on the circumstances, could be actionable.
1644	Since prostitutes grew up being abused, it seems like they do not like themselves very much. They know they can be murdered at any time, and they still do it. The money they make pays for the drugs they use to forget about what they are doing. Some get out of it.
1645	In New Zealand, the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the indigenous people, despite the treaty not being recognized by international law. There have been a number of other treaties established during the colonizing period, which if New Zealand is precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally, I am in the view that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that have been a cornerstone in international law.
1646	I think by your name you may be a Marine. Crimes are crimes, and some can be forgiven with hard work and a real change. I am an NCO, and I have seen troops grow up and take their duty and the rules seriously. You can change. Just hope it is not too late, like for Tookie Williams.
1647	Since it has been eight months, I doubt you will get anywhere with it. Not only that, you have to prove that they knew about the damage. The court does not side on just assumptions. If you do not like this answer, I would seek legal help!
1648	What you describe is sad, and the system we have devised. The courts are the best human beings have come up with so far in the history of the planet, but they are far from perfect and mistakes happen all the time. As you correctly point out, public "pretenders" are anything but helpful. What is important is to not quit, ever. Even while imprisoned, a person can use his or her wits, study the law, and work actively on the appeal. Deadlines are critical. Bad things happen to good people, and life is anything but fair. Instead of focusing on what happened, all a person can do is look to the future and make the best of every day.
1649	The bill should pass because this is a country of law. There should be no way for anybody to break those laws because they want to survive.
1650	In a common law jurisdiction, valid decisions/interpretations by courts are binding authority on lower courts. Civil law systems (such as France, or Lithuania) work differently, and there the court holdings are not binding in the same way as under common law.
1651	We all make mistakes, and usually it is not a big deal except for the extreme annoyance and all the bounced check fees. If you are worried about an arrest warrant, then I am sure you are doing this deliberately and trying to defraud the company. You have probably sent them a couple of bad checks already in an attempt to string them along, so your guilt is probably pretty well established. You can hope that you do not have to share a jail cell with a gross deviate of some sort.
1652	It is legal, since salaried employees do not have to work overtime. However, minimum wage law still applies, so you should calculate how many hours you work each year and divide your salary by that number. If the result is less than the federal minimum wage of $5.15, or your state minimum wage of $7.63, or even your local minimum wage of $9.50, then your employer is in violation of the law.
1653	Web Master has a point. Not only is it unethical, but it resembles the workings of Stalin during the Cold War. This isn't too unusual. He seems to make bad and, at that, horrible decisions in the oval office. This is a catastrophe, and it doesn't surprise me that his idea of public safety is ruining, ending, and controlling the lives of his citizens. He allows the REAL bad guys to reign havoc, and be done in time to kill some more of his own people and innocent civilians elsewhere.
1654	Police brutality exists in the U.S. for the simple fact that they do not screen individuals before they give them a badge and gun. Additionally, factor in the race card because most of the cases are white on black crimes. They fear the black man, so they automatically resort to violence to solve the issue. It sickens me that they allow them to get away with it. This country prides itself on freedom, what about the freedom to walk or drive and not have to worry about the people who are supposed to protect you. Stop Racism, stop police brutality.
1655	It is President Clinton, and though people are going to say it is just politics, it is the same issue. If it is wrong now, it was wrong then. There is a double standard between Democrats and Republicans. People are screaming about an illegal war, but can't remember President Clinton asking congress for any wars he got us in. However, you have President Bush, who did go to congress.
1656	The entire town is aware of this and the police, prosecutors, and judges all agree. We watched the cops pull a man over one night and they gave him a ride home. We followed them, but how can you fight it?
1657	The death penalty is not revenge. Instead, it is the punishment assigned a person after having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers. There are laws that determine what crimes and under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted.
1658	No, not unless you are a licensed real estate broker and you have a written agreement signed by all the beneficiaries of the estate. As a professional representative, you can seek additional fees for additional services to the estate involving the sale of real estate that either the beneficiaries expressly consent to in writing or that a court allows on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on such factors as additional time and liability over & above the routine duties of a professional representative, not a percentage of the sale price, which would constitute a commission.
1659	Stem cell research could save millions of lives. However, perhaps procedures and treatments that arise from this research should be optional. For example, "Miss Smith, you have cancer. We can cure it, but the treatment involves stem cell research. Would you like the treatment, or would you prefer to die painfully?"
1660	You should get a new boyfriend because he is not able to change or want to change. Driving on a suspended driver's license is a serious misdemeanor. He was sent to rehab to give him another chance but messed it up. If they find out about the driving violation and being kicked out of rehab, he may face jail time. I know you are dedicated to him, but give that dedication to someone who has a chance at doing something instead of doing time. Just get out of his way or you will be joining him.
1661	The person above is incorrect. Property is property. He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage. His business will remain his business as long as he is able to run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business. The government cannot take it away just because he is here illegally. The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes. So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills.
1662	Not all downloads are illegal. For example, if someone has legal ownership of a work, they are perfectly entitled to grant permission for others to make copies and distribute them. Additionally, many works are either public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement. These are again not in violation of copyright laws. Therefore, there are many legal ways that software like Limewire can be used.
1663	You can explain this to them and ask them for their opinion on your situation. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction.
1664	You are either very young or new to this country. If you have money or are famous, you can buy whatever judgement or law that you want enacted. If you are poor, you are just out of luck. Lawyers will not take your case unless it means a lot of money for them. Even if you are totally in the right, unless they can make a huge profit they will not touch it. So, repeat after me. Money equals privilage under the law. Poverty equals nothing. Save yourself a lot of time and learn it now.
1665	Conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society. Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.
1666	I apologize, but Martha Place was executed in New York, not Louisiana. The first woman executed by electrocution in the state of Louisiana was Toni Jo Henry on November 28, 1942, which is 64 years ago today.
1667	If the judge could not hear her clearly, then he has every right to ask her to remove her veil. If the woman, who is a lawyer, could not be understood in court, then she is not doing her job properly, and the judge cannot do his job properly either. I can only respect him for asking her to remove her veil. It is not for very long, and she was fighting for someone in court!
1668	I do not believe that terrorists should be granted equal rights, but I do believe that they should be treated as human beings. If they cannot be peaceful, then they should not be allowed to walk the streets. If they cannot be reformed, and they continue to be disrespectful, no government should allow that! Terrorism costs lives and tax dollars, and I would not think it was a bad thing if they were executed for their crimes! It might sound harsh, but think of how many lives it could potentially save!
1669	I am not sure, but ask if there is a youth court or teen court system you can go through. Typically, teenagers learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. Typically, if you go through teen court you end up doing community service and the offense does not stay on your record. My preachy moment: drink if you want to drink, but do not ever drink and drive. It is inexcusable.
1670	The crime itself is what you are punished for, not the reaction times.
1671	The laws need to be changed so that parents can't just throw in the towel and leave with the kids. They should have to judge the spouse they are leaving as dangerous, an adulterer, or mentally ill. They should leave with nothing.
1672	There are several rules governing what you can and cannot do to the flag. Check the link below to see them. FYI - Bushy Bush desecrated an American flag by signing his name to it for a "fan". He is thereby a traitor to this country, and should be tried and condemned as such. Just my thoughts on the subject. Can you tell I didn't vote for him?
1673	I understand how you feel. You have said that you believe you are in love with him, but you haven't said anything about the other woman he is with. If I were you, I would try to steer clear. If he manages to end his relationship with the other woman and keep his relationship with the kids, then maybe you could think about him again. I don't know about the law or deformities, but I would say no to both questions. Just think of the people involved in this tangled web and how your decisions will effect them. It's tough, I know. Good luck.
1674	I think you know what it is and are probably trying to grow it from the way you are talking. Marijuana seeds do not fly out of birds. Even a novice knows what marijuana looks like from the leaf. Yes, you can get in trouble for cultivation, but not that much if you only have one plant and claim you do not know what it is. They will not believe you anyway. You will not get caught, if the cops find out.
1675	Using illegal drugs is a crime, regardless of your condition or sex. However, a more severe punishment should be imposed on a woman who would subject her child to illegal drugs or alcohol. I would entertain the idea of institutionalizing the mother until the child is born, after which she should go to prison. The problem is, who is going to pay for that? That is right, the taxpayer. Accountability is the number one lacking quality among many Americans today. The fact that we as a society tolerate stupidity and irresponsibility is enabling these morons to continue making poor decisions, having children, using drugs...etc. Until we hold people accountable and responsible for their actions, there is no real solution. Good luck and take care.
1676	It is not likely that the court will change existing precedent. However, hopefully, the court will uphold bans on late-term abortion, require parental notification for teenagers, and require these "doctors" to become required reporters of abuse like all other medical professionals.
1677	People complain that it is against God. Therefore, those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays. MAN makes these rules and uses God as an excuse. There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you hear anyone complaining? Anyway, marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even an atheist. What is the big deal? After all, is it not their God's job to judge and punish? After all, they believe that their God gave them free will.
1678	I believe ADHD and possibly some forms of autism are not a bad thing. When they are forced to focus, they do great things. I have many friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they get great grades and retain more knowledge.
1679	Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard. Many self-described liberals, libertarians, and conservatives rarely listen to each other on how to better society. Liberals see government as the only solution to all of society's ills. Conservatives and libertarians find government as the mere deterrent to social ills and adhere to free market fundamentalism as holy. It is as if the free market makes everything a utopia. These differences in dogma often resort to divisive politics. How is that any different from religious differences?
1680	I am in my twenties, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow. It costs between $30,000 and $800,000 to transplant my marrow, which I am giving away for free. While I am on the list, I would jump at the chance to sell my liver. The medical industry is making money hand over fist, and I want a piece of it. If women have the right to abortion, then I should have the right to sell my marrow and organs.
1681	I think the proof is in the pudding: take something you consider yourself truly knowledgeable about and look at the news coverage. You will find it partial at best. You will encounter people who "read an article" related to your field and understand how naive they sound. Journalists can only provide so much context and it is usually never enough to give a layman a foothold in the subject matter. This is not to say that news isn't valuable. But it does mean that if you read the paper every day and gravitate toward the Ukraine stories while having virtually no historical background, have never been to the Ukraine or Russia, never done any research or met people from the cultures involved, you should speak, think and feel with an extremely humble tone about the subject. In fact, it would be more wise to ask questions than to profess any opinion at all.
1682	While it is important to stop at a railroad crossing, there are many reasons why it is not safe to do so.
1683	Lobbying should be prohibited. No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are perfectly fine. -Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means. The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question. This also means that outsiders can't influence who gets voted by donating toward a certain candidate. I haven't given this a whole lot of thought, so I am looking for counterarguments.
1684	I am a 19 year old male who plans on majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I have never had an intimate relationship, nor have I ever asked a girl out. I know that they will say no. I am not an attractive person, nor do I have good hygiene. Even if they said yes, the relationship would only last for a day. I feel that a person like me is not really meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any sort. I feel that I have to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.
1685	The people who love the movie are mostly the ones who watched it as a child or young adult and have fond memories of it.
1686	I understand the concern that this could lead to people believing the system is not legitimate, and that nobody wins the large jackpots. However, it is ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in jackpot money just magically disappear without any Lottery employees coming forward. Furthermore, why do we not doubt the legitimacy of other large jackpots? For a long time people have been buying scratch-off tickets without the ridiculous self-identification laws.
1687	I work downtown LA and the homeless problem here is quite bad. There was a man who defecated in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They are a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness. I think for any major city to develop faster, it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. I think they should be rounded up, placed into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way, major downtown areas could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem will not work, and it really hurts the local economy.
1688	I am considering taking up their offer of a refund due to the fact that I have doubts about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same amount.
1689	Bungie's next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, but I do not understand why it is being hailed as the next big new thing in gaming.
1690	I am a native of Canada, but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I found this to be a positive thing, and I clung to it for a time. However, from what I have observed, particularly with people who have moved from their mother country and settled permanently elsewhere, it only seems to lead to bigotry and a stagnation of one's own cultural and personal development.
1691	I believe kids owe their parents everything, because their parents brought them into this world and gave them life and food and shelter and relatively healthy childhood. Kids should stay at home, or as close to home as possible, for their entire lives, so that in case a parent has any need at all, the kids can drop what they're doing and help the parents, because they owe them their lives.
1692	The issue isn't with feminism, it's with the fact that many men don't have the courage to approach a woman.
1693	I think the Japanese need to protect themselves a lot better against China. The Chinese are becoming stronger both in their economy and military. I am sure they have many generals just aching for payback from all the atrocities committed by the Japanese in WW2. The Japanese won't even acknowledge the genocide, that's just rubbing salt in the wound. On the other side, I know Japan is being protected by American forces, but how much can they trust the US? Would the US go to war with China over Japan? (Or South Korea for that matter) I think it won't happen, and in a tight spot, they would just choose to abandon those allies.
1694	The intent behind Affirmative Action is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter their background. However, basing this giving on skin color does not accomplish this.
1695	I understand the Democratic Party collects the most money from political action committees. As a union member, I understand our dues are low, and the Teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively small amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a good way to check the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same.
1696	I am not sure what the popular view on reddit is about this, but in the real world, I hear arguments from both sides of the political spectrum regarding what the founding fathers would have thought. I do not really think it matters because the founding fathers were not gods who could prepare for any problem or know everything, they were just people. We live in a different time than the founding fathers, and even if we didn't, it isn't like they were infallible. I do not think a view deserves any more merit just because it is the view of one of the founding fathers.
1697	I have long struggled with this and I'd like to hear strong arguments from the other side.
1698	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is a healthy body type that people have naturally. Fat isn't healthy. Curvy women don't fit into the "skinny" category because of their assets, but also aren't an unhealthy weight. I feel that it is unfair and misleading to actual curvy women for fat women to use the descriptor curvy. That being said, I have nothing against someone for being overweight.
1699	Some creationists argue that evolution is wrong and creationism is correct. For example, the fossil record shows that ancient clams are in layers below giant land sloths. If all organisms lived at the same time, how did a giant land sloth, which moves at 1 mph or less, manage to outlive an organism that thrives in water during a global water flood? It seems to me that such a question is preposterous and that the flood never occurred.
1700	Reality TV is garbage. First of all, it is scripted. It is meant for amusement. People live vicarously through reality TV shows. Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative way. For example, The Bachelor teaches young teenage girls that they need to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different women to get their attention. That is not reality. Also, many of the reality shows, such as Rock of Love, Flavor Flav, demean women. This is what our children grow up watching.
1701	I am not sure how far along this project is, but I am convinced that a useful stipend laptop can be made for under $100. When I traveled, I was always issued an Asus Eee which cost around $300. I am also convinced that access to information infrastructure is an essential part of nation-building, but Microsoft Powerpoint is not. Perhaps somebody can clarify for me, will these laptops have access to the internet?
1702	Friends come and go, but family is constant. We share the same blood, look alike, and have similar strengths and principles. Even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creature on this planet.
1703	I am not sure if the creator of this debate had a specific event in mind when they posted it, but I am willing to take part regardless.
1704	I would say before. I have never been married, but I have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw. As far as sex goes, it was much better in the beginning of a relationship. Your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new. After a long time, you become less excited and your sex becomes routine. I find the excitement of having sex with someone much better, constantly being turned on and not being able to keep your hands off each other.
1705	The facts are clear, the man was an Islamic extremist, and this was clearly a terrorist attack. The better question would be, why can't we admit it?
1706	Death should be celebrated as an integral part of life. The empty casket is a reminder of what the person was, not who they are or what they were to those around them. Funerals are reminders that the dead will no longer be who they were to those around them. Celebrating the dead is selfish; remember them, but do not mourn over your loss.
1707	We are not talking about killing for fun, rather about putting the animal out of its misery. Your argument is irrelevant. What we are saying is with animals, it is not worth much to put a sick animal through an ordeal just so its mate won't pine for it. With humans, the case is different. Besides the emotional trauma which is much more complex in a human than in an animal, seeing as we are much more complex beings, humans bear a responsibility to those around them, their wives and especially kids who depend on parents not only for food, but for education among other numerous things. Reptiles, on the other hand, desert their offspring as soon as the eggs hatch. A snake will eat its own eggs if it can't find food.
1708	I am not sure that you can. Since video games and movies are all we have to go on, is it truly possible to kill that which is already dead? We do not really know. I think that if something possessed the undead, they would not be able to return to the land of the living.
1709	Art is art, and that is true. If it is in the correct area, such as in your neighborhood, nightclub, etc. It is part of the culture. However, it is wrong to deface public buildings, historical sites, bridges in public areas, and otherwise beautiful landmarks of the city.
1710	The runes were discovered magically by Odin after he hung from Ygdrassil for nine days. During his delirium, he saw visions of runes on the ground below him. Eventually, the runes evolved into a kind of writing system.
1711	Animal testing should be allowed under strict conditions until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing.
1712	Not at all because everyone's sense of morality is different. For example, if a pro-choicer was engaged in an abortion debate, the pro-lifer could call them moraless all they want but still not change the fact that the pro-choicer has valid points. Indeed, in many cases, morality is extremely subjective and thus saying that someone "lacks morality" is about as valid an argument as "you suck."
1713	Isn't helping a little better than not helping at all? If I was going to buy an iPod anyway, wouldn't it be better to buy a red one that sends a tiny fraction of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green one that fits better with my wardrobe but doesn't raise money for anyone but Apple? Gestures like those Livestrong bracelets are weak, but when it's something you were already going to buy (read: not a stupid-looking rubber bracelet), I think that having a philanthropic option is refreshing--even if it's just a little philanthropic. The previous options weren't at all philanthropic. If it's no worse and it's not the same, odds are it's a little better.
1714	Bad Company is boring because it is hard to kill people on there. The controls are weird, the vehicles are boring and hard to control for some reason. Also, the maps are way to big. On cod, the map called "Wastland" is one of the biggest and people hate that map. MW2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering what is about to come from around the corner. Battlefield is boring because you always know where the enemy is and you do not have to go get them. Unlike in MW2, you are thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to develop. Additionally, weapons on MW2 are realistic, except for the At4.
1715	I believe school uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights because of what they are wearing, but that is just us high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we would not notice who's who, and we would still get made fun of.
1716	The Venetian does not charge for valet. The MGM corporation is doing this because all their hotels are doing this.
1717	The food was ok, the portions were huge, but I do not make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.
1718	This place was a last minute find and was not what I expected in a big way. The sushi was delicious and fresh for our group of 10. The service was top notch and the location is convenient to the action in Vegas.
1719	There is a Vietnamese restaurant called Vietnam Grille on South Blvd. It is a popular place, and the reason why it is so popular is because it is very cheap. We went during lunchtime, and were able to get a seat quickly. We ordered the Crispy Spring Rolls and the Beef Pho. The Spring Rolls were delicious, and the sauces on the side of the table went on to my plate to make a delicious dipping sauce. The Soup arrived in a large bowl, filled with a delicious broth, noodles, and beef, and all the extras on the side to add. It was piping hot and delicious. You have to try it. I will be going back again and again.
1720	The waiter was very polite and attentive, but the food was very bland and boring.
1721	The sub sandwiches are great and the staff is very friendly. However, on more than one occasion they asked me if I wanted to add cheese to my order and I said yes. Then, when I get the sandwich, there is no cheese. Other than that, I always have a great experience.
1722	I did not have a good experience at Caffe Boa. I was in the area with four other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30. The hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress that she would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat and sat. We never were greeted. We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes. We got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater.
1723	Schools should not create dress codes. On the one hand, uniforms help students focus more on their work. On the other hand, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school. However, kids are allowed to have their own creativity.
1724	Another reason wearing a school uniform is good is that it will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school does not want the children to show, and students will not be concerned about what they are wearing.
1725	School uniforms are not as useful once the child is no longer in school.
1726	There are many reasons why FF IE is not successful.
1727	One feature that sold me on it was Tabs, which Microsoft copied in version 7.
1728	I have a varying answer based on the circumstances. If the situation became out of hand, the police knew it was my man who committed the crime, and they had all the evidence and witnesses to prove it was him, then I would turn him in. If they knew it was him, then it was only a matter of time.
1729	I would not turn in my spouse. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. But it depends on the reason behind him killing someone. It cannot be random killing. I would turn him in for that. For the reason that I would think that I would be next to get killed.
1730	It depends on the circumstances, if I truly believed that she was remorseful and that I could empathize with her for her actions, then I might be able to forgive her and not turn her in.
1731	Murder is an unforgivable mistake, but love is not. I have made a commitment to stay with her through difficult times, and I will.
1732	I am too old to try dating again. Besides, you do not specify who she killed or why. Maybe she had reasons. Not everyone deserves to live.
1733	I would not report him unless he killed multiple people in an accident. I think if I loved him enough, I could cover up the facts and pretend it never happened.
1734	I could go on and on about books that describe the world as it is in books.
1735	Books are cool, TV is not. Nerds like books, I think Black Ops is better.
1736	Books are better for your eyes than TV., Reading books often can help you with spelling, and writing better.
1737	It is better for young kids who have school work to do, and it is healthier for their eyes.
1738	India is not ready to lead the world for many reasons. First, politicians are involved in black money cases. They try to gain or earn money as possible. Second, they always try to make a big issue of useless topics.
1739	India will never get the chance to ruin the world, so do not try!
1740	This debate is ridiculous. No, they do not. They are practically a 3rd world country.
1741	India does not have the potential to lead the world due to corruption in politicians, numerous religions, and fighting between various religions.
1742	You need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, and effort are all invested. You must know people who would help you.
1743	On 28 January 1819, Raffles arrived in Singapore. He saw the good location of Singapore and he signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johor on behalf of the British East India Company to use the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post and settlement.
1744	I am confused as to whether Adrian Peterson is my husband or not. Your name and speech make me believe that you are.
1745	The argument that porn would expose one to reality in life and thus increase one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults is completely false. Porn is definitely wrong. After consuming it, the guilt of wasting your time, wasting energy, wasting effort, not devoting yourself to another thing, and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. Trust me. It is a path that should not be taken. It is as bad as smoking and using drugs. I think the only reason it is not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
1746	Pornography is wrong, mainly because they are not doing it right. In three years, it will be in 3-D.
1747	You are as brainwashed as I am, except you are on the other side.
1748	From a casual internet user, I prefer Internet Explorer because it has a more sleek design and is easier to use the bookmark/history feature. However, I am using Firefox because my brother made it my default browser.
1749	Physical education is not worth the time and should not be offered in school.
1750	Crimes like robbery and fighting often occurred, so Farquhar set up a small police force.
1751	Farquar dealt with everyday problems during the early years of Singapore. He also attempted to get to know the people and understand Malay, whereas Raffles did not communicate with them.
1752	Your argument doesn't hold validity since in the cases you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness.
1753	Legalizing drugs has nothing to do with saving lives. Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by eliminating the need for illegal abortions while killing oneself.
1754	This is a common view of the creationist argument. None of what Sean said has anything to do with science. This is a theological view of the world. I understand if you are religious, just do not try to hide it as science. Science is about the scientific method. If you want to debate the science of evolution, you must at least understand the scientific method.
1755	Pornography is a choice. Whether you are watching it, or participating in it, it is a choice.
1756	Regardless of whether you are doing something for yourself or others, you will always affect the people around you. When asking someone why they choose to help others, the response will be "it feels good to help out." Ultimately, people do not help out others unless they get some sort of satisfaction from it.
1757	In the long run, putting others first and thinking about yourself later is preferable.
1758	Your father may not be the best, but he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with their children, which shapes and molds a son or daughter's character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are, even if they are not ideal.
1759	For example, I grew up without a father and if I had the choice of being a billionaire or having a father, I would choose the father. He is not even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because it is very bad for children. Kids in school will ask about your father and you have nothing to say. Whether he is good or bad, a child should always be in touch with their father. Even if he is not with the mother anymore.
1760	I would rather have a bad father than be fatherless. I would rather have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was.
1761	Water bottle usage is not worth causing the environment any more harm than it already is. These bottles will not start to decompose for another 700 years.
1762	People drink water everyday without realizing that they are polluting our planet.
1763	The high price of bottled water has nothing to do with the water itself but the costs associated with bottling, packaging, shipping, marketing, retailing, and transporting it around the world.
1764	Water bottles are a good idea in an emergency situation, but other than that they pollute the land and big companies make a profit.
1765	Sheep count him to fall asleep. He won the 1995 World Series of Poker using only one card.
1766	Plastic can kill many types of fish species. There have been 26 pieces of fish found in one fish. Fish are vital to the environment as a food source for birds which eat bugs, therefore the cycle of life.
1767	Unless the brain is used, no human being can understand any medium, be it TV or books. By watching TV, people can create a make believe situation and think, "What if they would go left? They would be saved, wouldn't they?". Furthermore, we can watch television in the dark, while to read a book you need the lights on, which also wastes electricity.
1768	I think television is more helpful because you can watch and listen to something being explained. For example, if we read about budding or spore formation, we have to create an image in our mind of what that is like, but when we watch the animation of budding, then we understand better. Some people cannot even imagine, so television is helpful. However, we should watch television within a limit because the excess of everything is harmful, even reading of books. Surveys have found that a normal person can remember 10% of what he has read and 50% of what he has listened to and watched.
1769	People who are against television keep saying that television causes obesity. I am not going to go for a run and bring a book to read along the way. I think it is much easier to exercise watching television than reading a book. In gyms people do not have books in front of them, instead they have televisions. Studies have shown that television is even more stimulating than books.
1770	I would say it helps you relax, in case you are tired, and you can read to relax, plus, have you ever considered the commercials and how annoying they are?
1771	Marriage evolved from moral and religious reasons, not merely a union approved by the state. To degrade marriage to accommodate base desires of gay couples in disguise as a right is simply stupid.
1772	India is quickly emerging as a hub for international trade and investment. India has provided a huge opportunity to enhance trade and investments in sectors such as mechanical and electrical engineering, food processing, automotive, tourism, and banking. Almost every multinational company is focusing on India.
1773	Christians are also amusing because they waste half of their Sunday going to church.
1774	I find most religions to be ridiculous and illogical. Most people who follow them have been brainwashed in childhood and do not have an individual thought process. There are theists who will twist any logic to fit their views. They are intelligent ones that you have to watch out for.
1775	Ever since recorded history, people have believed in sky spirits for which there is no evidence.
1776	I believe you should hit your kids if they do something really bad, like wreck your car or steal, you need to hit them so they know they should not do that.
1777	Yes, because if they fear getting hit, then they will not do it again.
1778	Parents should only use spanking as an option to discipline when it is needed. If the child does not follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several warnings, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
1779	I believe spanking should be used if it will teach the child in the long run. However, each child responds differently to different punishments. While one child responds well to just telling them no or grounding them, another child may require a spanking to teach them right and wrong.
1780	I believe spanking is an effective way to punish a child, if other methods fail.
1781	I support this because spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
1782	I would also point out that atheism predates Christianity. Your "test of time" argument is not valid.
1783	Parents should not use spanking as an option to discipline their children because it only makes the child angry and not interested in learning what they did wrong.
1784	You should talk to the kid with love and understanding, so they can understand they are doing wrong.
1785	I would turn her in immediately because if she did something like that then she is mentally unstable and I do not want to be her next victim. Murder is a crime and it is illegal and not right.
1786	I understand some people are crazy in love, but that would be too crazy for me. Taking another person's life is never the solution or acceptable.
1787	Murder is a crime that cannot be overlooked. Sleeping next to a person who has committed a murder, and you knowing about it, makes you as responsible as that person.
1788	There is no excuse for killing a fetus or a child. If a woman was raped, it is not the fault of the child. The woman with the child, whoever they are, should speak for the child and know that the child would want to live.
1789	I despise PE because I have to run so much.
1790	Physical education does not help overweight children. They simply eat too much or are growing, and in due time they will become normal.
1791	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might satisfy them, but will not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. If "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, then law should never change. We should revert back to tribes and slavery - why challenge any assumption?
1792	If they want to marry, let them. If they were your child or adopted parent/child, you would accept it.
1793	I believe I will go with personal pursuit because no matter what we do we think of ourselves first. I think it is human nature. However, personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself. I need to think about myself first, my success, and then think of others.
1794	Our animal instinct is survival. It is what makes us flinch when we see something coming at us. It makes us react faster. In today's post-modern world, our instinct has changed to keep obtaining money to keep us alive. Times change, but our desire to survive above others is still there.
1795	I believe pursuing personal goals is better than pursuing professional goals because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. Additionally, from my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.
1796	I think that everyone should try to be less selfish, but we live in a real world and do things that better benefit us.
1797	I believe in personal pursuit because I believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals. After you accomplish your goals and become a better person, you will be able to help the common good.
1798	There is almost no chance of her being brought to trial for perjury, but he might be able to do something in civil court. If she has a new car, she should give the car in question back because it won't be worth the hassle. Remember, it is up to the district attorney whether or not to bring criminal charges, and he is not likely to get involved in a family dispute like this. Even in the unlikely possibility that the DA did consider the case, he will not prosecute for one very good reason. The case would be based on the word of a convict against the word of your niece, her mother, and her grandmother. DA's do not prosecute cases they know they cannot win.
1799	I believe that law enforcement should be duly empowered in writing to take the necessary actions, including the use of force, to carry out the duties of that job. Additionally, I believe that citizens should be more involved in community policing. Neighborhood watch is a great program; if there were more people out there doing it, there would be less demand for police, etc.
1800	I do not believe there are any victimless crimes. In fact, some laws are enacted because they seem to do no harm to an individual, group, or society as a whole. However, you need to consider the full effect of the action to determine if there is harm to society. For example, prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, but some aspects, such as working on a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate. Similar considerations would apply to other 'victimless' crimes.
1801	It is illegal to import drugs into the United States, but it can be done. The person I know who has done it has never had a problem with the drugs (in this case from India), and never had a problem with Customs or the Postal Inspector. I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious life-threatening conditions, because the quality is questionable. However, for other drugs I would do it if I lived closer to Mexico (where I can just go over the border and buy cheap prescription meds). If you do a Google search on the drug name that you need, you will most likely find an overseas site which offers it for sale. Good luck, but remember it is illegal and potentially dangerous to your health.
1802	Although the previous answers are correct, you should pay your rent because of your contract, I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and do not pay him. He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a crook, you will not see the whole amount of your deposit returned. You're moving out at the end of December anyway, and he has no power to just 'throw you out'. He would have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal proceedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway, so, I say sod him! Good luck!
1803	I went to Prague and they are less uptight about sex in general. The local bar had strippers and you could have an escort arrive at your door within minutes if you wanted one. I do not think that is true though. They are not that bad. I found it a bit seedy.
1804	It is a matter of belief. It is a philosophy of life (and death?) that is ingrained in us generally as children. Sometimes our parents teaching does not take effect, or we decide the rules our parents set down for us are not for us. At other times our parents do not teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and rules are made (hopefully for the good). Sometimes those in authority get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler. Legislators try to take the middle path. And who knows better than our legislators on how to straddle the fence?
1805	The government already grows and distributes it to terminally ill patients, and they can tax it to bring this country out of the deficit. Besides, how many people die from pot related accidents? None. They are only doing 10 miles an hour. You can't kill anyone at 10 miles an hour. Canada has a man named Mark Emery, who is known as the "Prince of Pot." He has brought the country of Canada so much revenue by selling pot seeds, that they have no debt. Additionally, the U.S.A. would not have as many drug related crimes, and if it helped sick people to ease the pain, then I am all for it. With the pain Busch and our government put the American people through, we need something to help us cope.
1806	Guns are bad and should only be used by law enforcement. I lost my brother due to an accident involving a gun, and knowing that just anyone nowadays can purchase a firearm without even obtaining a license in some cases makes me shudder with frustration and disbelief! Recently, I saw a report on the TV news that even owning a fake gun such as the famous 'paint-ball guns' can lead to serious violence and even death. In some cases, people were accidentally killed or seriously injured while playing among themselves. In other cases, they were mistakenly shot by police who believed they had pointed a real gun at them. Let's leave guns in the hands of those who know how to use them in order to protect law-abiding citizens everywhere!
1807	I am incredulous that people answer questions when they have no idea what they are talking about. Do not consult a lawyer on this one. It would cost you too much. Small claims court is designed for someone like you with a case small enough that lawyers should not be involved. Sue. On the complaint, spell out the facts of your case and ask for alternative relief. Meaning -- ask for the car to be put in your name. Then put down that if the court denies you the car, that you are asking for all payments made on the car to be returned to you. Assuming the facts as you have presented them are true, then the court will almost certainly grant you one of these two remedies, possibly with interest.
1808	The statute is clear that a conviction is required. If the charges were dismissed or you were found not guilty, then the county cannot seek reimbursement. If you were found guilty and sentenced to jail, then you must pay. If you sat in jail for four months, you were either convicted or you couldn't make bail while you were waiting for trial. If you were convicted, even with a plea bargain, you probably owe the money.
1809	Lawyers are motivated by money and power. Without legal disputes, such as in civil matters, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for those lawyers.
1810	Civil marriage is not religious. It is, therefore, controlled by the government. I do not believe it should discriminate against a group like homosexuals, but it is most certainly within the government's prerogative to define marriage.
1811	There are many programs designed for felons to get their life back on track. You may be able to go back to school, depending on your desired field, and the government will pay for it. You should go to your local DHS or CPS office, they will be able to refer you to where all of that information will be available for you. Good luck!
1812	That video, and many others on that subject, can be seen at my link. I tend to view these as propaganda. I also view everything that comes out of the White House on this subject as propaganda. There are facts that will never be known. There are too many discrepancies on both sides of the argument to make an informed decision one way or the other.
1813	The terrorists were created by Pakistan, at least the ones who are active in India. This was done by the government that was in power previously. Now that the present government is trying to bridge the gap between the two nations, the terrorists are afraid they might lose their job, so they are turning against Pakistan now. I think it will take a while to eliminate all the terrorists if the same procedure continue.
1814	No, cops need the permission of the owner of the house to search it without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger.
1815	The truth is that there is no "one man, one vote." It has never been true, and it is only becoming more obvious now. In a republic, the only way to win is to save up your money and become one of the haves. That is the only way to win. Our government has no power. It is a facade.
1816	Why did you accept it in his stance? This isn't like a prize or a package from UPS that you can accept on someone's behalf. A subpeona is a very important document sent by the courts, with the specific destination being the person in question, not the person's dog, girlfriend, or coworkers. By accepting the subpeona, you made it easy for the server to nonchalantly say he "served" the document to the destination person, when in fact, it was not. To make an analogy, would you have accepted someone's document if it were a lawsuit? Are you that nosy for someone? The fact is, that person can deny that he was served because you have no real authority to give subpeonas. He can say you burned it and he never got it (no signatures that he himself received anything), and you could be in deep water for that court offense, including possible jail. So, yes, he has a decent right to be pissed at you. I would.
1817	J.R. thinks his job is to decide if homosexuals can get married, because he has no idea what his job is.
1818	Assuming that value can be reasonably calculated, then I would have no problem with a legislature passing a law like this. It meets the intent of the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause, and if the state decides that it wants towns to cooperate, that can't be a bad thing. The only potential downside is the cost of litigation if many people sue towns and counties to recover what they think they might have potentially lost, based on what some zoning code did in another part of town. That's a matter of writing the law intelligently and not allowing such legal loopholes.
1819	I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion. I know in my heart that it is wrong and not an option for me. However, I would rather these women who have their mind set on doing it go to a clean, sterile facility and not some rusty shack that puts their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, etc. I think they all know it is not morally right. They are motivated to have an abortion for situational reasons. I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and wrong about their option, but they felt that was their only way out.
1820	I imagine the settlement involves having all medical bills paid, and that the $20k settlement is for your pain and suffering. Generally, the lawyer will take his fee from the settlement, which is between 1/3 and 1/4 of the settlement. So, it's most likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will get $20,000, part of which will go to the lawyer to pay his fee.
1821	It would be unfair to force people to pay for things they cannot afford.
1822	It sounds like you need a different attorney, and a bail bond agent. First of all, this is enough to bring charges against the attorney, the notary, your mother, and yourself.
1823	Your question is both incoherent and contains mainly opinions stated as fact. Let me start by pointing out that it is standard practice for an attorney to be a notary. Before you call somebody unethical you better have a factual basis for doing so, which you do not have. I notice you make much of your mother having the quitclaim deed signed "for her own personal gain." I take it you regard people who do things for personal gain as scum. Well then kid, just what the hell are you doing this for? For YOUR personal gain? Guess what that makes you.
1824	Of course they would if they got in a position where they did not want a child. However, when many of those pro-lifers do get in that situation they will try to say something like "Oh I'm not like other females, because this or that happened, so this is why I'm having an abortion". It is usually okay for them, but they are anti-abortion when it is someone else.
1825	What they are talking about doing is not right. There are current laws on our books that would allow our government to fine an illegal alien $250,000 and then incarcerate them for years. Also, there are laws that prohibit employers from hiring illegal workers. They all need to follow the current laws. You are right. If you or I were to disobey the laws like these people are doing, we would be locked up for years. It's just not right.
1826	That would depend on whether the person was sent to a professional in the field where the person was being evaluated. In some cases the judge can send a person for re-evaluation if he or she determines the previous evaluation was biased against the person being evaluated. However, a person cannot be re-evaluated solely to satisfy the desires of a judge or anyone else.
1827	Since this is a family member, you have to work things out. Tell them privately that you will not accept any more excuses. If there was a valid reason, then you need to be firm but fair. This is not how people behave. Avoid getting the police involved if possible. Change the locks and explain that she is no longer welcome in your house.
1828	Marijuana smoking should be legalized everywhere. It is a simple natural herb that provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many beneficial medicinal properties. For example, it relieves stress, reduces pain, and certain studies show that it can alleviate asthma and be beneficial to Alzheimer's patients. The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine. The oil lobby, along with the media, who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which introduced the name marijuana, so that nobody would realize that they were restricting the use of hemp.
1829	I do not think separation of church and state has anything to do with being tax free. If a minister teaches the bible, that is one thing, but pastors like Rod Parsley, who have flaunted their political views for years, and allow candidates to speak from their pulpit, should lose their tax exempt status immediately. Not to mention he is a millionaire many times over.
1830	The federal government does not have the power to make laws concerning clothing, only in areas under direct federal control. States and localities have the power to make such laws within their jurisdictions. During the last 30 years, the laws concerning clothing have loosened. For example, most people no longer formally dress to go to church or to dine out. For those who do dress differently, they should be realistic in their degree of difference by not anticipating a warm acceptance of some style. This is particularly true when dress reflects sexual mores.
1831	I am not sure, but I find it hilarious that the UK wastes so much money on the royal family. Granted, I would not be as amused if I were English, but since I am not, I can laugh at that. I am glad my tax dollars go towards things like skiing, drinking binges, designer clothes, passionate love affairs, expensive cars, and castles, and I am not sure what else.
1832	Until these people have been charged and convicted of a crime, the judge cannot simply remove them.
1833	We are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. Think about this, what is different about killing for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising their usage more?--Food for Thought
1834	Theology is a third rate philosophy because it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims. It is less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy because of this presupposition. Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics, and related subjects form the grounds on which religions may be legitimately and fruitfully discussed.
1835	I do not think it is worth it to spend a lifetime experiencing hardship and fear in the real world. I would rather have a normal life inside the simulation, which could be terrible and rough, but could also be happy. In the end, we are souls connected to a life support system, so if my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimuli to my brain rather than "real" experiences, then so be it.
1836	I am a heterosexual male, and I cannot find a reason to condemn it as immoral. Though I do believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the bible is true, and thus biblical scripture does not convince me. Additionally, if something is wrong, there should be observable reasons in reality, so the justification for homosexual acts being wrong should deal strictly with observable reality.
1837	Cosleeping should never be encouraged as it is dangerous for both the child and the parent.
1838	I believe businesses should not give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces. There are many tough professions out there that bring lots of value but do not get discounts. What about farmers? They feed us right. Doctors? They keep us healthy. Scientists? Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our every day lives.
1839	A while ago Putin ordered all his government officials to close offshore accounts and buy Russian cars. Additionally, wealthy Russians use other countries to skate around Russian taxes. Now the US and EU are sanctioning business and people. Europe buys from Russia much needed gas, and in turn, Russia buys things from Europe. This may hurt Europe more in the long run, but may help Russia, as Putin may use this to reign in his corrupt officials and tax skater billionaires. Do not rely on overseas business and do not use tax havens.
1840	I disagree with the idea that WBC will disappear if we simply ignore them. They will be in our history books, despite what people want. One thing that is good about their existence is extremism. I believe we should study more extremism. It pushes people to do the craziest things and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they are right and we as a society are wrong. If we study the extremes, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things.
1841	My father is 28 years older than my mother, and he met my mother when she was 17. My father and I had an argument about a 34-year-old teacher from our high school being involved in sexting. I failed to see the issue, as there were bigger problems in the world, and I grew up with a belief that age did not matter when it came to intimacy. My friend and I expressed our beliefs in a text, and the other girls in the group did not agree with me. Why was I wrong?
1842	I have read the "Limits to Growth" study written in 1972 and subsequent books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and others who were talking about the problems and limits to capitalism and consumer society. Recently, I learned that the inventor of fracking, George Mitchell, held a series of conferences in Houston, Texas focused on the "Limits to Growth" study. I was shocked that such a rich and powerful person would be fundamentally critical of the very system that gave him so much wealth. I can't imagine oil executives having similar opinions now.
1843	I understand that sour cream is already available in a squeezable container, but I believe that this should be the default container. Similar to ketchup or mustard, it would be more useful in a squeeze container.
1844	I believe the current driving age of 16 is too low and teenagers are a danger on the road. They are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting-related accidents proves that they are unable to consistently operate a car safely. I think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use. Car accidents happen all too often and keeping kids off the road will make things safer for them and for the adults that need to use cars.
1845	The title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, people with God kill people" has led me to write this CMV. I am not a religious man, so I don't feel this is a biased CMV. I feel saying "Guns don't kill people, people with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people". I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect. It harbours hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own. Change my view.
1846	I am not sure why, but I completely feel that if you make enough money doing the worst job on earth, you should be content. For example, if I made $100,000 a year from a job that I am not necessarily content with, I would prefer that over a job where I made between $60,000 and $75,000 a year and enjoyed the eight hour workday. In my opinion, if you made good money with a job that (for you) has low job satisfaction, the time you have off will be better because you have the money to be able to afford and do whatever you want, versus being happier with your job but not having the things you want in life. I feel I am at a serious turning point in my life, and I want to make sure I look at all angles of opportunities presented to me. Please CMV!
1847	I have been wondering about this. Recently, there have been several interviews with Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to slag mp3's. However, I am willing to bet if you sat him down with proper experimental controls, he would fail as much as anyone else at hearing any difference, at 256 kbps bitrate or higher. That being said, I still don't like mp3's, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob, probably much like a lot of people. I like my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold cd's, or LP's. However, my ears probably can't catch much difference. And certainly I love plugging an iPod full of mp3's into my fancy vehicle audio system.
1848	I believe politicians do not have the knowledge and know-how to run a country. We have seen multiple cases of corruption, bankrupcy all over the world, and countries failing to maintain a positive economy. Most of the solutions come from an assembly where politicians reunite and discuss those solutions, but most of the time they fail to implement a good one. In the early 1900s there was a movement called Technocracy movement which wanted to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they ran. For example, education would be run by someone connected to it that has spent a majority of her life studying education. I believe our politic system isn't being run like it should. CMV
1849	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health had been a bigger issue and looked at more closely then the shooting potentially would not have happened. I'm all for feminism, do recognize that women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. CMV.
1850	I hope I am not being overly pessimistic with this post, but I would really like to hear more about what might happen and CMV.
1851	Why did the "true" gods of today's religions not see fit to make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? If God is jealous, then He should have made himself known earlier. If He is not jealous, then He should have made himself known sooner. Does this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do we know the earliest gods who were worshiped are not sitting "up there" seriously ticked off? Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Pissed, that after explicitly putting their word forth, we strayed and worshiped false idols.
1852	Miscommunication is the cause of many problems, such as car accidents caused by drivers who are unaware of what other drivers are doing, things turning into gossip because somebody did not take the time to say the full story, fights caused by two people who did not comumcate the rules about a game, terrorists blowing people up because the government would not listen to their concerns in the first place, and many more.
1853	Welfare is bad because it reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them content where they are.
1854	The drinking age should be 16. There is strong anecdotal evidence that countries where casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age have lower rates of drinking-related diseases and deaths. If casual drinking is integrated into society, it can significantly curb binge drinking when one reaches age 18. Furthermore, these extra years of alcohol sales can increase tax revenue and fund programs that help those afflicted with alcoholism to recover.
1855	I am excited to see this forum early, as I have never really liked red, since when I was younger it made me think of blood and murder. As I have gotten older, I have come to appreciate this color more. It is also the color for fire trucks and letter boxes.
1856	This argument is very close to me at the moment. An ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old has had unprotected sex with a minor who is not even fully developed yet. He sees no wrong in what he is doing even though he is breaking the law. b. He is aware he is breaking the law. c. He is proud of it.
1857	Adam had the choice of doing good or evil. He chose evil. That choice damaged his relationship with God and resulted in an evil world. Now man still has the freedom to do what he wants to. The problem is that man only wants to rebel and do evil. Look around for proof. God has a remedy for the evil. Repent and trust in Jesus Christ.
1858	I admit that humans are very different from the rest of the animal kingdom, but I do not see how this elevates us in any way.
1859	This piece is a call to action in the UK to put an end to the government's Big Brother program. London's Westimister Council is further compounding the problem that people do not trust the government and their surveillance of British people by taking away something that most people love and want to keep. Additionally, Banksy has made what was once a boring, ugly wall interesting, engaging, and poignant. He is a celebrated artist in his own right and Westiminster Council should recognize this piece as a gift to be embraced rather than erased.
1860	A recent survey shows that most children see Christmas as a gift day, or a day where they get whatever they want from their parents. This is clearly not the case. Christmas is supposed to be about Jesus' birth, and when Santa Clause is involved, children, and even adults, no longer see Jesus as the main focus of the holiday. This is similar to a birthday party where everyone gives attention to a different person instead of the birthday boy or girl. This is clearly not right, and that is what is happening in Status Quo.
1861	I agree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is an absurd thought. One of the reasons performance enhancing drugs are illegal is that they harm the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the player's health because they are too young to see the consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models for many young kids. Do you want kids walking around pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending they have breasts? This will encourage the use of steroids for younger kids. If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, all athletes would start using them regardless if they want to or not because they will feel that they need to take them just to be able to compete with other athletes.
1862	Nazi Germany was an economic power in Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new military tactics, and far more powerful than Japan. Japan was fighting in jungles in smaller bands, and their navy was stopped pretty quickly. Only their loyalty to the Emperor stopped the entire country from surrendering a few years earlier.
1863	This is a very touchy subject, and the French nationalists are not objecting to his performance based on artistic merit, which they would have a valid point about, but on the basis of his nationality, when all he is really trying to do is celebrate the history of an important place. Personally, I think the best way to celebrate Quebec City's "birthday" would be to build a huge statue to the father of Canada, General Wolfe, on the plains of Abraham.
1864	This is a difficult choice as I love both of these bands. I believe Queen is superior because their anthems (We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions) will live on longer and their music explores more themes and ideas. Pearl Jam is good, but Queen is better.
1865	By allowing people to choose where their taxes go, the government can determine which organizations are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people.
1866	Ocarina of Time is regarded by many as the best game in the Zelda series.
1867	I will start. Although I am not sure if I would actually go through with it should I find myself in this position, I am willing to entertain the possibility. If I were suffering from early onset Alzheimer's or a similar mental decline, I would consider ending my life. The ability to maintain a continuous consciousness is what makes me who I am. At the point where I lose my grip on reality, forget who I am, forget what I am, forget what I believe, then I cease being me.
1868	The average American salary is $32,000. The average teacher's salary is $53,000. In Wisconsin, the salary, including benefits, is $75,000. 4.5 billion is spent on teacher salaries, and 1.6 billion is spent on their insane amount of benefits. I believe that this is a large amount of money for someone to receive, especially since mediocre teachers are practically impossible to fire. Teachers should be paid and given raises based on performance, not the amount of years they stayed at the school. I recommend watching the documentary Waiting for Superman, because it sheds light on the many imperfection of our failing public school system.
1869	Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct? Just because one man has a feeling that all matter warps space-time does not make it true. Think about it...get ready... this is the theory... all matter sucks. Literally! This theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract. Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it.
1870	The United States has one of the strongest navies in the world. We have a total of 366 ships in service at this time. We have four ships in an area that is in danger of pirate attacks. Can a mere four ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. Why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the four ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? No.
1871	There is no disagreement, but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israel's interests are America's interests; they are one and the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may, which would involve us in the situation. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen, but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.
1872	My husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi we had ever had, and he has had a lot of sushi. Seriously, drive to Boulder City and eat here. It is worth the price of a rental car.
1873	I own a business on Craig Street and sometimes I am forced to eat the food on this strip. Yesterday was the day. The staff was rude, they did not make eye contact, and the food was not fit to feed my dog. Do not go here.
1874	I had a very enjoyable dining experience here. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and left the cheese off. The pasta was perfect and the fresh basil was a highlight. However, our server Alyssa was very attentive and knew what was vegan on the menu. She was always making sure our drinks were filled. I would definitely recommend this place and will return.
1875	The service was slow and the food was not worth the price.
1876	I haven't had a bad experience with one, however, the service here sucks. I've come here twice and this last instance was the last time I bother. I walked in both times and it took about 15 minutes to get a single jumbo jack last time. It wasn't busy. Today it took three minutes with me being the only person in line and two people looking right at me and not taking my order before I left. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. Five Guys will continue to get my business over you because they seem to take less time than you do and they are a walk-in burger place.
1877	The atmosphere was nice and the staff was helpful; however, the food was not as good as I had hoped. I would not return due to the high price tag and small portions.
1878	This buffet was not worth the money. The food was bland and the selection was small. I would recommend going to Mandarin instead.
1879	I believe that school uniforms are very comfortable. There is a gap between the rich and poor, school uniforms are efficient in many ways. If they wore plain clothes every day, they would be concerned about the brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible, so the poor students can feel inferior. Also, they feel a sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniforms are convenient. I do not have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1880	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms, students are given the occasional day to wear casual clothes, but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "uniform."
1881	I vote against it, because when they are young and trying to find themselves, they do not need to get rid of their independence.
1882	I think school uniforms are a bad idea. It is too much work to clean them and it is difficult to put on many things in the morning.
1883	I like Firefox and this website, but it is not very clear. This one is better: theworlddebating.com
1884	I can easily reconfigure Firefox to meet my changing needs. For example, if I need great SEO extensions, I can get them. If I need an HTML color picker instead when I get more involved with other elements of site development, FF is easily remodeled to suit my new browsing needs. The breadth and variety of Firefox add-ons is a critical advantage.
1885	Firefox has more user-made extensions, which appeals to the user base. Therefore, it is preferred.
1886	I would not turn my spouse in. I would simply say, "You told me I had a part in it." We will go our separate ways. In truth, I would not want to know in the first place.
1887	I would not rat on him because I never know the reason he killed that person or if it was self defense. I have his trust and I would not let him down for no reason. Additionally, his secret is safe with me.
1888	If my husband had committed a murder, I think I would not report him. My feelings would be stronger than fear of having a bad husband. I am not sure of my exact answer, but I am sure that I could not look at him everyday and act like nothing had happened. I believe that feelings are stronger than anything, and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
1889	If it was the person you love and want to spend your life with, then it is definitely no. People make mistakes, but if I were you, I would stick with them and never turn them in. If that means I am part of the murder by not saying anything, then so be it.
1890	Books are superior to television because they impart more knowledge than television does.
1891	Books are better than television because television makes your eyes bad and kills your imagination. Read "Television" by Roald Dahl and you will understand.
1892	I think India cannot replace other developed countries like the United States, London, and other countries because most of the people are illitrate.
1893	I think it is better to have no father than a bad father. Either way you still lose.
1894	I believe it is better to be fatherless than to have a bad father.
1895	Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan included separate areas for different ethnic groups and provided other facilities such as roads, schools, and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was formed by Raffles to oversee the project.
1896	Raffles sacked Farquhar when he returned to Singapore because he was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population, and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart.
1897	Evolution and creation go together.
1898	Was there a historical record of man evolving? I must have missed it.
1899	Our world could be a giant hologram.
1900	I used to be a Firefox user, but since I have 2GB of RAM and I like to use more than one program at a time, Firefox uses too much memory for its advantages.
1901	Physical education can be very rewarding for both students and teachers, provided it is taught and encouraged properly.
1902	If we do not start at a young age, how are we going to combat childhood obesity?
1903	I believe physical education should be mandatory in school because it will help students become healthy people, and they will not be at risk of obesity.
1904	Farquhar earned the affection and respect of the people. As a result, when he was dismissed, thousands of people gave him farewell. This proves that Farquhar is very important to the people.
1905	William Farquhar stayed in Singapore longer than Raffles, so he had more time to get to know the people, earn their trust, and find out what problems they were facing and solve those problems.
1906	Are you suggesting that if the woman had an abortion immediately afterward, that it would be acceptable?
1907	Now, in my beloved language, I will say that what they call a "bebé, a humano" is nothing more than a plant. Less, I would like to say that the only thing that it does is churn up resources, just like a plant, although plants do provide us with oxygen. No one knows if it is a life, but you can feel or think that this is what they usually say that causes humans to behave better than animals. Aborto es matar a parásito.
1908	It is not a matter of what you choose, it is a matter of "who decides?". A woman is not your property, nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to command her servitude.
1909	It is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the option of choosing pro-life. If I choose pro-life, I have no choice.
1910	The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.
1911	It is no more wrong than any other form of expression that is used for exploitation.
1912	Pornography is not wrong as long as it is not explicit, such as child, animal, or rape.
1913	Usually my decision is in the affirmative or in the negative, depending on the circumstances. Today, however, it is in the affirmative of advancing for the common good.
1914	I personally believe that advancement of the common good is better. I do not really know how to back this up, I just know it is the way I feel about the topic. I guess because I am not a selfish person when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. If there is something I have to sacrifice personally for the advancement of the common good, I will usually do it.
1915	Who would ever want to get rid of Catholic school girl outfits?
1916	School uniforms are a great idea because it makes it impossible to hold the race for fashion among pupils. If one pupil is richer than another, they can begin to show off in front of those who are poorer. This action will create a negative atmosphere in the school and can start a row between both pupils. As a rule, it often occurs between the girls, although it is not rare between the boys.
1917	I think school uniforms are a good idea. There is a gap between the rich and the poor, school uniforms are efficient in many ways. If they wear plain clothes every day, they become concerned about the brand and quantity of clothes. This makes teenagers sensible, so the poor students can feel inferior. Also, they feel a sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniforms are convenient. I do not have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1918	I believe it is nice to have a school uniform. Each school's uniform signifies its goal. For example, I wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days. White is an indication of peace and blue is fidelity in relationships. Additionally, identical uniforms remove the wall of status. It also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class, they are treated equally under one roof.
1919	A bad father could teach you more than good ones. Maybe he can teach you how not to be, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all. He could toughen you up. Also, you will at least know who he was. You will never wonder if your father was a saint or not. You already know.
1920	The production of plastic bottles uses up to 47 million gallons of oil per year. Additionally, over 80 percent of plastic bottles are discarded.
1921	I like television. It is cool and great. TV is like the baby in my womb, it is like the sun in the morning, it is like the cool, breezy air on your first day of school, it is like the day you are diagnosed with cancer, it is like the day you find out you are homosexual, it is like the day you realize you have wasted your time reading this.
1922	Plastic is good for light weight and for division.
1923	Based on the bible, it is definitely wrong. Realistically, marriage is intended for a man and a woman. It is a way of saying to reproduce.
1924	I am a heterosexual woman who is married and has a daughter.
1925	From a biological point of view, men and women were created to be together. However, this idea has been corrupted by the morals and society of our time.
1926	If we all did the same action, society would benefit. If everyone did the same action, society would not benefit. If everyone was gay, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was homosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was homosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was homosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit. If everyone was heterosexual, then no one would benefit.
1927	India is surrounded by water on three sides, a trait that few other nations possess. This is an advantage for India.
1928	India is moving a step ahead in becoming a world power everyday. The concerns shown by other countries say it all. Yes, we have some internal problems which other countries do not have, but time is water and brings changes. We are growing as one of the leading powers. I will not compare my country with others, as Napoleon said, "Comparing yourself with others is the same as insulting yourself." We have the third largest army in the world, we produce the most number of doctors and engineers every year, but we still do not like to compare ourselves because we do not believe anyone is stronger or weaker than us.
1929	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense.
1930	No one has ever claimed science is perfect. That is the difference between religion and science. Science admits it does not have all the answers, while religion is dogmatic enough to not even recognize facts or what truth really means.
1931	The most important reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we would not be the wiser. What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies or hallucinations. For example, there is not a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.
1932	After I was spanked, I never did it again. Therefore, I would spank my kids out of love.
1933	I know from experience that children learn best when they are physically hurt.
1934	I believe you should spank a child only when they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to make the same mistake.
1935	One of the key components to Christianity is FAITH. Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there.
1936	I am a believer in Jesus, so I am on his side.
1937	I assume everyone on this side of this argument was raised in a Christian home. Grow up and ask yourself why you worship a cultist.
1938	Why are we fighting? Right now those scientologists are running amok. We need to unite to fight them.
1939	I do not think spanking should be necessary. Spanking would last for a minute, while punishment could last for two, three, or more weeks.
1940	No, because if we hit our children, they will think that we do not love them.
1941	I do not think spanking is effective. Perhaps it will once in a while, but as they grow up it is not a good technique. There are other techniques they can learn from.
1942	Not all situations need to begin with violence; parents should only hit their children for discipline if it is necessary.
1943	I disagree with parents using spanking as an option to discipline their children. Children will not be scared of what their parents are going to do to them. Also, if you do that to your children, they are learning what their parents show them. Also, that is not going to help the children very much.
1944	I would answer in the affirmative if my spouse killed a person in self defense or in defense of another person. However, if they killed a person for killing someone or something similar, then no. If they killed someone cold heartedly, for money, objects, or a pure disliking of a person, then yes. Someone that cold could kill me.
1945	I would turn in my spouse. There is no way of knowing that if they killed once, they will not kill again. If they become paranoid, they may do crazy things. It would be hard to do because you have a strong connection with your spouse, but it is something you need to do for your own safety.
1946	Murder is not right, and a person who commits the act knows the consequences. I would turn them in.
1947	We are not the ones who gave birth to the baby, so why should we be the ones to put it to death? We do not have the authority to do such a thing.
1948	Reagan once said, "Notice that everyone who is pro-choice has been born."
1949	As long as it is not disease, we should all be fine with it. It is not our business.
1950	Doesn't the Declaration of Independence state that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?
1951	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done.
1952	It is better to help yourself before you can help others.
1953	It is easier to get most people to pursue personal interests than it is to get most people to pursue the common good. This is why Communism failed.
1954	Yes, it is illegal. The consequences will be you and your friend going to each house and cleaning it up. Just like when people toilet paper. A few years ago when I was a minor, my brother and I went around drawing on people's garage doors in chalk. Long story short, we got caught and had to go around and clean every single garage. Have fun. :)
1955	The Nazis did ban private possession of firearms for a reason. They did not want people to be able to fight back. Additionally, when guns are outlawed, only criminals will have guns. While some may argue that criminals and police are the same, I argue that at that point those two groups become indistinguishable. Do you honestly believe that all police are honest and trustworthy?
1956	This is a great question. In our real world, it is much more likely for a poor person to be convicted of a felony than a rich person. Therefore, when ex-felons are denied the franchise, poor communities are denied equal representation. Read some law articles on the difference between de facto and de jure; I'm sure you'll find the subject interesting and enlightening.
1957	No, you still have to pay your rent. However, if the landlord does not make the repair, the tenant can do any of the following: Take the rent when it is due to the local clerk of courts. A tenant must be current in their rent with the clerk of courts. Apply to the court to order the landlord to make the repairs. The court can also lower the rent until the repairs are made or give the tenant some of the rent money so the tenant can have the repairs made. End the lease. Cancel the rental agreement and move. This can be done only after the tenant has given appropriate notice, and the landlord has failed to correct the condition.
1958	Although adultery may be against the law where you live, and you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, you really have misplaced anger. This woman was not coming to your home. She was invited to your home by your husband. She was not making out with him. Your husband was making out with her. She did not get pregnant. Your husband got her pregnant. Make sure to divorce him.
1959	The issue may not be best approached through your "legal recourse." If you have not done so, tell the designer how unhappy you are and why, and ask that the designs be redone. It may be that the designer will work with you to redo the work -- it would be in his/her best interest to see that his/her customers are happy with the design.
1960	Your question is not relevant because the word was used by certain people as a term of offense to describe "some other people." Yes, we know that black people use the word within their own community, but that does not change the fact that the word was first given currency as a deliberate insult.
1961	Most other cities that are more spread out will clean the streets less frequently.
1962	I would let him sit in jail and think about what he did. If he is a man at all, he should apologize to you.
1963	I do not believe that capital punishment is appropriate in a civilized society. For serious crimes, a life sentence in prison is appropriate. I do not understand how killing someone solves any problems.
1964	I believe that the age requirement has to do with the fact that some people's brains do not fully develop until the age of 18. This poses a risk for more serious damage being caused by alcohol in an 18-year-old. Whether this is true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age requirement. Personally, I believe that if you are old enough to die for your country, you should be old enough to have a drink.
1965	The Child Protective Services in my state are very destructive to families. They take children from their homes without any explanation, keep them apart from their families, and basically terrorize everyone, including infants. I have seen many families destroyed. My son's is one of them. There seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play their God games and bowing low each time.
1966	All of them. That is why it is called rape. If it was not rape, then there would be nothing to go to court about. The trick is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist. One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape, in which the so-called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. I do not know of any specific court cases regarding this.
1967	Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. However, what about the baby's choice? No baby would decide, "I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I could live outside my mother's body), stabbed in the skull, and have my brain sucked out." How selfish are the women who think it is all about them and what they need or want? People that support this should be forced to watch one being performed, live!
1968	It is possible, but it depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge. Many federal courts require individuals with cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service. If a judge has a standing policy against such things in his courtroom, whether on or off, you could be held in contempt. My guess is that most judges would not go as far as to hold someone in contempt if it was off. However, I have personally seen a person's phone get confiscated because there was a concern that the individual was attempting to take pictures of witnesses with it in a drug case (witness intimidation).
1969	The whole thing sounds suspicious to me. An extension without the proper footings is not legal, and if it has been built without planning permission, then it is also not legal. The letter you write should state that the building has only been built for the time that it has, and that the building should be inspected as there are no proper foundations. If you knowingly write an incorrect statement and the truth comes out, then you could be caught for aiding and abetting an illegal sale. The whole thing is a mine field, so either stay out of it altogether or bring the local authority into the picture. The estate agent should also be made aware of the problem as he could be in real trouble.
1970	I think the most annoying thing about these laws is that we pass them to "save lives." In reality, I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers money on picking up the cost of a person's health care if they choose self-harming behavior. For example: seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use. If we were just honest, and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
1971	You cannot export democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government. Muslim countries do not have the same Enlightenment level as the United States, where we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience. Islam needs to go through its own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed. Until then, we can only keep (weak) control by military force which sets up blowback as we now see in the Middle East.
1972	The answer is yes, but it requires patience and understanding. As far as your plight is concerned, I wish you the best in finding true love, it is possible, and it is possible over 50. However, if there is no trust in that one you are crazy about, then move on.
1973	I am not sure why you and your daughter's father are not together, but if he refuses to pass a drug screening, then most likely his custody will not go through. When this case presents before a judge and you mention drug activity, the judge may order a drug test. If he fails to comply with the court order, he will not get custody. Although I am not personally in the legal field, I have had to deal with custody battles many times in my line of work and it is never a happy trail. I wish you all the best.
1974	Please be aware that there are many illegal immigrants in our prisons and jails for crimes such as rape, murder, drug smuggling, and theft. Because they crossed the border illegally, it means that criminals also crossed the border. Without a system, anybody can come in, no matter how diseased or criminal. Additionally, not all illegal immigrants are honest and hard-working people.
1975	It is pointless and egotistical to vote for your own answers. The idea of this site is that we collect information from various viewpoints, and then allow others to judge the value of the content. Voting for your own answer defeats the purpose, so it is certainly unethical. It is also probably against Yahoo!'s rules.
1976	The Supreme Court has already ruled that abortion should be legal, based on a person's right to privacy over what happens to their body. This has nothing to do with when life begins, etc... as some would like it to. It is all about this great country's freedoms and constitution giving us protections over our personal self.
1977	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless people's health and lives, as well as save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. I do not think that is a loss of money. It would only save lives and money. Besides, the cigarette industry deserves to collapse. I would love to see that day. All those people selling death deserve to be jobless, not teachers, medics, and firefighters. Those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
1978	I believe the issue is not about the letter of the law, but rather the spirit of the law. In my opinion, the issue is more with geographic and monetary limitations.
1979	Tell them exactly what you posted here and they should excuse or re-schedule you. I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice because of that. If you're studying in college, they will excuse you so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it.
1980	In North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. However, you must first take a state mandated firearms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office, fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, and then apply for a handgun. In the meantime, you could have purchased as many of whatever you want off a street corner in one day. Why do criminals have it made in this country? Why do they make honest people go through so much trouble to get a handgun? I know other states are even more difficult to deal with...New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns. Why isn't there a national standard on the gun law? Should individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something straight out of the Constitution?
1981	I believe the main problem with the trust issue is due to the criminal justice system. In order for law to work it must be swift, severe, and guaranteed. For example, people sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no punishment, and you can commit the same crime in two places, one gets you probation and the other gets you 20 years. I believe that until these issues are better delt with, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone. Unfortunately, our justice system is unique in the world, it is a system that would literally let 10 guilty people go than send one innocent person to jail. I cannot argue with that, but hopefully in the future people will realize that our justice system is a mess and someone will fix it.
1982	Before hiring an attorney, consider contacting the business and informing them of the incident and asking for their insurance company's name. Often they make reasonable offers, such as a doctor bill plus $1,000. If they refuse, then you should consider discussing the matter with an attorney. If you are not injured and received treatment, your case is weak. Damages for pain and suffering will be approximately $1,000 unless you can prove the incident was the result of negligence or malice. If you hire an attorney, it is likely you will not have enough money to pay the bill for your care.
1983	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Although there seems to be more public sentiment against illegals here of late, I would blame that on the media or the politicians making an issue of it more than anything else. I've lived in Texas all my life and the illegal alien thing is nothing new. There were plenty illegals here for more than thirty years and never heard one complaint until the last few weeks when the media started blasting it out the airways. Unfortunately, I've noticed that the media seems to have a large affect on the popular opinion here. Why they have chosen this time to make it a major issue is beyond anything I can understand.
1984	It is legal for a woman to have sex with a man. However, it is extremely difficult for a man to prove that he is not willing to have sex.
1985	I heard about this on the news this morning. In my opinion, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidentally got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is. On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.
1986	The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts. Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. They will not be prosecuted.
1987	If you feel that it is necessary, yes, but are you still going to be able to work and bring in your own income? These semi-truck drivers carry insurance, some of them carry million dollar insurance, but not all of them go after the company he is driving for. Don't go after him. He probably feels guilty about it every day of his life. I am very sorry for your pain. Good Luck to you.
1988	The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues. Guantanamo was an excellent example. While the inmates were humiliated, they were not tortured. The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the United States. Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture. Lastly, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.
1989	I am moving to Singapore in a few months and discovered that they have a flat tax system, much lower than the US, on income. They also have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand name clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy, especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from the tax challenges faced in mature economies. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting to do it as well.
1990	In my opinion, the main controversy comes down to whether abortion implies killing another human being or not. To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity, since it is our brains that make us sentient. Therefore, if a fetus does not show any signs of brain activity, then it is not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted. This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially making the abort issue much easier to solve.
1991	I believe that if a person is able to commit suicide, they should be able to continue living. It is not rational to consider or act upon such a thing when you are willful.
1992	I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better chance of comprehending what is going on. The students that are exceeding may be put in higher classes so they do not become bored with the curriculum.
1993	I feel that concepts of right and evil are man made and subjective. Because of this, there are no objective morals and true 'good' and 'evil' don't exist. I am not advocating rampant immorality or anything. Most acts we generally consider immoral are detrimental to society. Murder, theft, rape, etc. all of these things may not be intrinsically evil, but they are not beneficial to one doing them or society in general. So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feelings, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.
1994	If something is important enough to cover on a website, then it should be easily found within the core content of the site and not shoved into an FAQ section. I think people only turn to FAQ pages if they cannot find what they want within the main site. When clients demand an FAQ page, I will challenge this and ask them to rethink what should be in the core copy and what is irrelevant. If the information is already within the main content, and they still want an FAQ section, they are just adding unnecessary repetition into the content. Websites should never include an FAQ section and I cannot find an argument to support their use other than improving SEO. Change my mind.
1995	I am very interested in a debate. I am aware that censorship is related to my question but I want to know why my opinion that using the word is wrong and not about how implementing a censorship would work.
1996	I have seen many movies and have never understood why people in the audience clap when the movie ends. I could understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or when an actor from the movie was in the audience. However, for normal movie-going circumstances, I just don't understand. Please change my mind so I can stop getting annoyed when a theater full of people clap.
1997	The world is chaotic and every choice you make, even subconscious ones, affect your destiny. Therefore, the choices you make as an adult are a result of how the world treats you as a child. The seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide our destiny more than the ones that seem meaningful.
1998	Tests are the only effective means of objective measurement and are necessary to evaluate if the system is working properly.
1999	I do not think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of a planet with life. If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life. But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe? It could be once per universe, once per galaxy, or once per 100 stars. It would look the same.
2000	Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel in the last two weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to cease-fire without retaliation. Hamas' disregard for civilian casualties by firing missiles out of civilian buildings is enough justification for Israel to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.
2001	Since my building lacks an elevator, I keep my bike secured outside. About three weeks ago, my bike was stolen, I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen again. I am very pissed now. There is no way I am throwing another 80+ euros to buy a new one at a shop. I also refuse to buy a cheap one which was obviously stolen. It looks like the best option remaining is starting to steal bikes on my own. Why should I not do that? Please provide a better alternative.
2002	With how close the world has come to annihilation due to leaders who have been a bit trigger happy (Cuban Missile Crisis), I truly believe nukes are pretty much the only reason the world isn't in major conflict right now. The Cold War, for example. If the US and the Soviet Union did not have their nuclear arsenal, what reason would Stalin, Khruschev, etc have for not invading the rest of Europe? They could have easily done so and not much the US could have done to stop them. Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we do not like each other.
2003	I often see criticism of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the West does the exact same thing with breasts. In most places, women must cover up their breasts in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor videos or images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned upon by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly. How is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs? I invite you all to CMV.
2004	The argument presented by the Washington Redskins is that a team named the Washington Redskins is the same as having a team named the Detroit N*****s. This is illogical. First off, when has anyone ever heard the word redskin used outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone ever used the word redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term, but I am going to assume it is. However, redskin is not similar at all to using the n word simply due to how the word is used in context.
2005	Skateboarding is seen by many as being a form of hooliganism, associated with being immature, and generally has bad connotations. However, I consider it a form of street art, and therefore I respect it.
2006	I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall.
2007	I do not think anyone ever 'asks to be raped', but I think if you dress like a whore, you increase your chances. Therefore, if you dress more conservatively, you reduce those chances. Women are always saying that they should not be treated like sexual objects, yet they constantly dress in a way that makes men (or maybe just me) see them as such. I'm not saying dressing nicer clothes will stop rape, but it couldn't hurt. This is my current view. I'm not stubborn, so I want people to change their minds. My comeback is always, "Why put yourself in that position."
2008	I am wondering about perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA considers bad, my mind tends to think of Putin, Osama Bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say, "Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. Thanks
2009	Gravity is only a theory and should not be taught in school.
2010	Religion, being based on zero evidence and abstract ideas, attacks intelligence and mental development of human beings. From birth to adulthood, a person is capable of understanding the values Earth and Physics have to offer unless intercepted by religion. If easily convinced, this person is at high risk of losing the mental capabilities of being'smart' in this sense.
2011	American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that our tax money goes to pay for their children's public education and emergency room visits. They do not pay into the system but steal from it. Their very status should say illegal. We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to citizenship so that those who are born here = automatic citizens.
2012	Owen Wilson's Kentucky Fried accent was inconsistent throughout the movie, and the suicide scene in Life Aquatic was not as dramatic as the suicide scene in RT.
2013	Married life is everything in place, stability for the rest of your life, a partner who loves and adores you so much that they make a lifetime commitment to you, respect from family and friends, and most importantly HAPPINESS (otherwise, why get married in the first place). Single life is generally synonymous with loneliness, a level of immaturity, selfishness, ignorance to making a true commitment, stuck in the memory of the 8th grade class dance! While I understand completely it varies person to person, I believe there is more respect for a married couple who truly learn life's true beauties (trust, mutual respect, lifelong commitment to another human being).
2014	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired, while a chainsaw is continuously running. If there are only a few zombies, the shotgun would have the advantage of distance.
2015	To be fair, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction. That is not the nice part, but it is part of the package. Moreover, humans have a moral responsibility to moderate their impact on the natural world. However, we are doing more right now than any species ever has before. Would it be "enough" if our impact was offset by our own, which is hardly "natural", or are we supposed to save every last species, however unfit?
2016	I suppose this depends on the album you are listening to. For example, I will use the example of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. When I listen to it through speakers, it sounds more "thin" and "uneasy." When I listen to it through headphones, I can more fully appreciate it.
2017	Almost every day, a Democrat politician laments the fact that we have not captured or killed Osama Bin Laden. While it would be a great accomplishment, removing Bin Laden from the planet would do little or nothing to stop terrorism.
2018	It depends on the genre. For First Person Shooters, RTS, MMORPGs, and racing games, I prefer PC gaming because I am more accurate with a mouse and keyboard than a controller. My PC's steering wheel and gadgets make the racing games much more fun than a controller does. Pretty much every other genre however seems to benefit from the console controllers, side-scrollers, action RPGs, RPGs, sports, etc.
2019	The death penalty conflicts with the Eighth Amendment in the constitution. Retribution is another word for revenge. The US executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders, but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves. This shows that the legal system is unbalanced. Once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged showing mistakes had been made. Additionally, not enough research has been made to except the deterrence effect.
2020	The integration of Muslims within Britain is currently a problem. Christians and Muslims are using the debate as a way to integrate more religious power within the country. This is why the Archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration.
2021	Cats are wonderful animals and pets. They aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference. "Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do." Jack Burns from "Meet the Parents." With cats, there is no cleaning up the yard, having to walk a dog and clean up their poop, loud barks at night, slobbering all over the place, no puppies pissing all over the floor, etc. Cats are adorable creatures. Dogs are...well...dogs!
2022	Operation Eagle Claw failed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert causing damage to most of the helicopters attempting to rescue the US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran. This was not due to poor planning or inadequacies by the military or the administration. Obviously Carter would've easily won re-election and Ray Gun would not have been elected. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been under a republican president. Since 1968, 28 of the 44 years have been with a republican president.
2023	This is a blanket assertion. Just because a leader is a dictator does not mean they should be disposed of or permanently eliminated.
2024	I believe 1984 could be the "best" in the sense that it is prophetic. I feel that 1984, like all the best products in the world, fulfills its function beautifully. I admit that I have not read the other three books on the list, so I can only offer my opinion.
2025	To all those doubters, you are right. No building in the history of mankind has ever had a steel frame burn to the ground. It must have been that really hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that fell, completely unattached to the tower must have imploded on itself because of the? I forgot what I was saying. What did the Bush administration say again? Cause I'm sure that's it. They would never lie to the American public, right?
2026	I am not saying it should be English, but there should be one official language we use to communicate with each other. This would allow us to do business much more easily, understand each other, and communicate ideas properly. The internet has given us all the ability to communicate with each other, all we need now is the same language.
2027	We have something against non-Christians here? People are voting against me opening my store to appeal to any clients who need something on Christmas Day. Besides, anyone here ever forget something while entertaining? Need some batteries for the new electronic gadgets? Want to pick up pizza for the guests? Catering for Christmas Day? Of course stores should be open.
2028	I found out about Butterblume on Eater Montreal and arrived there at 1:45 pm on a Saturday. The place was busy, but we were able to get a table for five. The menu is unique and not traditional. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share, and I had the frittata with tuna for my main dish. Both were excellent. The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, and the acoustics are good. I will definitely go back.
2029	This place is a neighborhood bar that is located in a strip mall. This place is very loud because people bring their kids. The food is good, and the service is adequate.
2030	I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and loved their brisket and sauce. I moved to Phoenix for 4 years then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes, they have Rudy's but they are not nearly as accessible as they are in Austin. I went there once in 2 years. I went for a weekend trip to Phoenix at the end of July. My friend wasn't a fan of the sauce but I loved every second. Unfortunately, my friend wasn't a fan of the brisket/egg taco but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. Delish! Now I am moving back to CT so I am sure Rudy's is in my path but I am glad I got one last taste. I will miss it.
2031	I visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered (6) wings and fries. The small wings / fries came in a cardboard box. The meal was over priced for the value. There is also very little room to sit and eat inside. The owner appears to be a proud black conservative and has no problem letting you know that. I would suggest no black person support this restaurant.
2032	We visited this restaurant last night and were seated on the patio. The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to converse. The service was attentive and professional. We had the Brussels sprout salad which was one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and the ribeye taco platter. The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. My husband and I actually split everything and it was just enough. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant.
2033	The only complaint I have about Kafein is the loud rave music they play during the daytime. The food is delicious and they have a great tea selection.
2034	The food is generally excellent and delicious, but the service is inconsistent and the temperature is consistently high. I've visited this location at least four times and have yet to experience a 5 star experience.
2035	School uniforms do not provide the same protection from cold or heat as special clothes.
2036	The children lose their individuality and it does not feel comfortable.
2037	Firefox is more respectful of W3C internet standards, while soft sucks by trying to force us to use their own standards.
2038	You are asked before anything is installed for the browser. In Internet Explorer, random toolbars appear out of nowhere.
2039	I disagree, marriage is supposed to be a bond/partnership. If my wife killed someone, I would not hesitate to use the 5th Amendment.
2040	There is no debate for those who have actually read the book.
2041	I am impressed by your views. Where did you get these unique data points? I kindly request you to submit more points like these please. Do not mind my words, but all these special data points are accurate? Reply to me soon!
2042	I have to say, but just one word: corruption.
2043	India should not lead the world. First kill all the politicians, then India will develop tomorrow.
2044	India has a class of opressed people, a huge wealth difference, and a language that the majority of the world does not understand. India's education is not comparable to Western education, and the world's economy is controlled by the superpowers. I highly doubt India will ever lead the world, and it does not even have the potential to. It should leave that to the superpowers.
2045	In my opinion, it is better to be fatherless than to have a bad father. You have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is not going to be anything special.
2046	The Singapore Treaty was signed between Raffles, Sultan Hussein, and the Temenggong with seven ships witnessing the event.
2047	Sir Raffles is the rightful founder of Singapore because he increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. As a result, many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
2048	Raffles led the expedition to find a new trading port. Farquhar did not accompany him, so Raffles would have founded Singapore regardless of his presence.
2049	Without Raffles' vision and ambition, Singapore may have remained a sparsely inhabited island in the East Indies.
2050	Raffles was responsible for Singapore's economic growth. He increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. As a result, many people came to Singapore to trade with each other.
2051	God is abstract. He does not often appear. Generally, the idea of a god or gods is pretty difficult to think about. Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to grasp.
2052	The argument of creationism has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history. The writing of the Old Testament is a recent example, so the Biblical account is an argument that has existed much longer than your note.
2053	Your argument is no stronger because you believe your opponent is brainwashed.
2054	IE is terrible and stole the tabbed browsing idea from other browsers. You cannot get extensions for it.
2055	I like the cute little pop up windows that are not available with Firefox.
2056	Apart from the health benefits, there are many other benefits such as greater respect for the outdoors, sporting camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation, to name a few. Drop and give me twenty for your insolence!
2057	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after British presence was introduced.
2058	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because he had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is necessary to help him solve the problems faced by the people.
2059	Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other "more useful" countries for about four years. This shows that he was not a good developer of Singapore.
2060	William Farquhar was more of a founder of Singapore than Raffles was.
2061	Pro-life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted and impoverished children are born. Pro-choice, on the other hand, is the best.
2062	I am not sure how to answer this question. I need someone with a different perspective than mine.
2063	Would your arguments be any weaker if my opponent has actually been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth?
2064	Evolution through creation.
2065	Pornography is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people do not like them? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? No.
2066	I would like to point out that my parents are exceptional at making others happy. They spend all of their money and time on others rather than themselves.
2067	In a perfect world, everyone would be selfless and use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world, nor will we ever. I believe that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our lives would run a lot smoother. You can combine the two if advancing the common good does not sound appealing to you. There are plenty of jobs that do just that.
2068	I say the common good because of the type of forces that can be made as a group. For example, someone who says that by not voting they are not making a difference. However, when you look at the whole population or percentage, it is greater than those who did vote. Therefore, if you want a good to prevail, you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.
2069	I believe that school uniforms are a good idea. Uniforms improve student attendance, and students do not spend a lot of time choosing and buying clothes for school, especially girls. Therefore, they can use more time studying.
2070	I believe they are good because this way all the girls out there would not tease each other about fashion. Additionally, it makes all students look and feel equal, which increases their attention on school work since they do not have to think about whether they are wearing the most expensive clothes in school, or if they look the coolest, or the prettiest.
2071	Fathers can sometimes be bad, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them. You cannot have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up to the most.
2072	These arguments are not factual and make your team seem foolish.
2073	Do you want money or do you want to live longer?
2074	TV is superior to books because television educational programs are much more convenient and easy to understand. Television is also much more accessible for people who are visually or hearing impaired. Books are also less likely to be updated with new information, while information from TV can be much more accurate and useful.
2075	Televisions use electricity and books such as Harry Potter are made of trees. Therefore, they cause environmental damage.
2076	Americans spend billions of dollars on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. Additionally, compostable water bottles are also coming onto the market. These can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, and it is easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.
2077	The U.S. alone grew by over 13%. According to research and consulting done by the Beverage Marketing Corporation, the global bottled water industry has exploded to over $35 billion. Americans alone paid $7.7 billion for bottled water in 2002.
2078	Poland Spring knows that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.
2079	Gay marriage is not possible from a religious point of view. However, not everyone is religious or adheres to specific religious guidance.
2080	I vote "wrong" because it goes against human nature and the definition of marriage. Also, you cannot exclude religion from this argument because that is what happens when people do not have faith or belief in any religion.
2081	Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage? Which country legalized homosexual unions which led to a lower marriage rate?
2082	I respect other opinions, but in my opinion, gay marriage is wrong.
2083	I am a Christian, and the Bible clearly states that homosexuality is wrong. Call me pathetic, weak, or whatever you want to call me, but I know for sure that the Bible is the truth.
2084	India is a good country to live in. It has diverse culture, but it still unites as one.
2085	I know that I am Indian and I do not want to show my country down. The person who thinks that only by debate they will solve all the problems is wrong, because they also know how their country is.
2086	India and China both have the potential to lead the world. America continues to outsource good manufacturing jobs to these countries, which boosts their economies.
2087	Atheism is a cool guy. He makes my logic work and isn't afraid of anything.
2088	It is foolish to think that God does not exist. Any other argument is completely invalid.
2089	It is okay for parents to spank their children, but only as a last resort.
2090	Yes, even though there are many different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it will not work and they need a spank to learn they were wrong. Do not always spank them for no reason, that is bad.
2091	I believe children should be spanked once in awhile. I was spanked when I was younger and I could definitely say that I learned lessons. Do not spank your kids with whatever you find, you do not want to kill them!
2092	Depending on the punishment you give a child, it is not always effective. Some children require more intense punishment than you can give them.
2093	I am a Christian, and I am fortunate to attend a Christian school where I get to learn more about our amazing God.
2094	I found more peace in my belief and will continue to seek the Lord until the day I die.
2095	No, because they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.
2096	No, because spanking might effect the relationship between the child and the parents. Additionally, children can pick up on the parents' attitude of acting violently. There are better ways to solve problems, such as using the other techniques.
2097	The child is young and does not know what is right or wrong.
2098	I do not think anybody would enjoy getting spanked by their parents. Therefore, spanking should not be an option.
2099	Physical abuse towards children can cause them to fear their parents, which may cause a stutter.
2100	My point is that I would not want to live under the same roof with a woman who may be schizophrenic.
2101	If a woman is raped and is left with a child, she should put it up for adoption. If someone murders a pregnant woman, they get charged for killing the woman and the fetus.
2102	You are mixing topics, which creates fallacy in your argument. The debate is not about whether murder is moral, but rather the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy.
2103	There are many people in my school who are overweight and two periods of PE a week and after school sports have not changed them in the slightest.
2104	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between the person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. You do not chose to be gay either. Who would choose to live that way? It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way.
2105	It amazes me that people take the time to post a comment stating they do not care and that everyone should stop talking about it. Also, people who post comments like mine make me sick.
2106	I would like to start by saying that I believe marriage is ridiculous and should not exist. That is another debate entirely. In my opinion, animals should be allowed to participate in holy matrimony as well. It would certainly be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so than any wedding I have ever attended.
2107	In my opinion, if you better yourself, you can better the world. First, you need to focus on yourself. Then, you can take on the problems of the world.
2108	I would be lying to myself if I said that advancing the common good was better than a personal pursuit. There are too many bad things happening in the world, and your actions will make no difference.
2109	I believe a personal pursuit is preferable, as you cannot help others around you if you cannot help yourself. A personal pursuit is not always about money, but it can be happiness, love, and success.
2110	We need to keep our jobs; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which wouldn't be near what it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along anyway; vote for leaders who raise their salaries; stop trying to be the world's peacemakers and money controllers; and realize that the world has the same abilities and resources we started with. They just need to make a choice to utilize the resources they have and develop a work ethic and use them.
2111	The Americans have been gunning for his death throughout, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the death penalty. However, even today Saddam is feared and respected by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so quickly. Did you see the glaring eyes and stance when he recently told the judge, "I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?" The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddam's case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts? No. The chair will probably decay and break, and the switches/wires will rust or melt away. Do not suggest a rope, because there is no such strong rope exists in the world to snap such a strong throat.
2112	Freedom of speech should not be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. However, personal responsibility and accountability should be taken into consideration when producing those cartoons. I think the Islamic world is overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves appear like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for things like that.
2113	If an employer fires you, they must pay you any wages owed to you plus any other compensation (vacation pay, etc.) immediately. As a manager, you are responsible for those under you and the money. Your boss has to prove you took the money, but you might be able to get your job back-talk to the state or Federal Department of Labor. You could possibly sue for Wrongful Termination if your boss can't prove you took the money.
2114	In India, reservation has been used to please certain groups of people in order to gain quick votes. There are many aspects of reservation, such as the fact that there are some groups of society who need support in order to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness. However, there is opposition to reservation because the benefits of it are taken up by certain people in society who are already in an upper class. No one will object if a truly needy person gets the benefit; you and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping the benefit.
2115	If he is unhappy about your dogs, then that is where your problem is. Either you find a good home for the dogs, train your dogs, or move out to a house to keep neighbourly peace. Most likely he is gathering evidence that your dogs are behaving badly or out of control. If your dogs are really doing something that is damaging or noisey then it would be a good idea to train them. I have lived in an apartment and co-operation and sensitivity and tolerability are sometimes not easy. Two wrongs doesn't make a right. How many options do you have? You can't evict the guy. More complaints to the authorities is not going to get you anywhere.
2116	I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl did not do anything illegal, I assume (correctly), it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
2117	You cannot sue your company for a condition that you may have been prone to get due to poor health, eating habits, or laziness. Removing your pituitary gland will not cause you to get diabetes. You probably had diabetes but never knew it until they did the operation to remove your gland. I'm sorry, but the company is only responsible for an injury sustained while on the job. If you leave your job, your next job should provide you health coverage.
2118	I missed the last change by a few months, so I know how unpopular this sounds. Kids seem to be older, wearing makeup, hair gel, stylish clothing, and designer accessories in elementary school. I wished I could look like an adult when I was small. Kids own a wardrobe of electronic gadgets, too. They are desensitized to content like death and sex at an earlier age. What does this mean? Kids grow up faster on the outside. Perhaps if you take away all of these external modern devices, emotionally, they grow at a natural pace. Perhaps with so many distractions, overstimulated kids need more time to catch up to the quiet time they missed.
2119	I cannot find any ethical argument to rationalize his actions. You mean good unethical ones to rationalize his actions. Didn't Hitler think the same way? For the good of the many means violating the US Constitution. And it isn't fiction, is it? You just need some ammunition. Well, you won't get it here! And there was nothing ethical about nuking Japan. Truman was led to believe they were military targets, when in fact most were women and children. There wasn't a military target in sight! And we didn't have to nuke two cities!
2120	I do not think there will be laws protecting white males. I do not think there should be any laws at all. If you can do the job and do it well, I do not think it should matter if you are black, brown, white, yellow, or red. Just do the job and get paid.
2121	You have to pay for services like hair cuts, legal services, tax services, and doctor visits. There are expenses incurred in providing a service, including salaries.
2122	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can say anything you want as long as it does not cause harm to others. You can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, but you can speak out against your government or any other group. The problem is that people do not limit their actions to speech. Furthermore, our country is a lot better then pretty much any other and all you people who want to complain so much, just leave and you will find out what it is like to be oppressed.
2123	There is no law that says managers must hold back pizzas so you can deliver them. In fact, it goes against every cannon of customer service. The faster the delivery, the better.
2124	They do not. They have a free and open society, and although they are traditionally Christian, Muslims are allowed to build mosques anywhere and any way they want. They are even free to live in segregated communities. They do not even need to learn the language to collect on health and welfare benefits of their host country. The outcry comes when Muslims begin demanding that their new Christian neighbors not offend them with their traditional European ways of free speech, freedom in sexuality, and drinking good beer. Some Islamic leaders even begin demands of a separatist state for their small communities within the borders of traditional European countries. It is absolutely ridiculous that generosity and guest treatment are abused by some Muslims so horribly.
2125	Incest is not always "child abuse." Incest between closely related consenting adults is quite common. The USA is known for having the highest rates of incest among hispanics. Incest is widespread in Central and South America.
2126	Brian Doyle got what he deserved and should have gotten the last time he did it. Without law enforcement being able to improvise, criminals would run amok in this country.
2127	I haven't heard of that, but it sounds like it is a friend of yours. It sounds like she could get help through a pro-bono place, or a low income based legal services. You would be surprised at what some places consider low income. My sister's husband earns $400.00 a week in winter and $60.00 a week in summer, and they have three people in their household. They get around $46,000 a year and they receive assistance from WIC, Daycare Assist, and Food Excetra. So tell her, or help her find those services.
2128	It is the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state.
2129	I agree. It is not rational to punish the lazy and allow wife beating booze heads to walk free. Throw the potheads in prison?
2130	I am not sure if this is relevant to your class, but this is my personal opinion. Historically, when human rights were defined, women were not included.
2131	I believe we already exist in the misogynistic world you describe: in the United States, women are paid 75 for every $1.00 a man is paid for the identical work. Additionally, 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world live in poverty. Additionally, two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls. Additionally, 75% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women. Please explain how we are on such an even keel. How can anyone not be a feminist?
2132	If you are caught, the theater manager has the discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back. This is dishonest-- it is stealing. If you paid to see one film, and then sneak in to see a second film, then you have cheated the theater out of ticket sales. You also may be affecting the box office totals for the film you saw but did not pay to see. People do this all the time and get away with it, but it is still not right.
2133	The principle here is not that they are able to kill people, but for what reason. The execution of a known felon who has committed crimes deemed irreconcilable in the eyes of the community is not a crime or hyprocracy, but is justified and necessary. As for war, it depends on the reason. For an outsider of a regime not friendly to a country that is selfcentered hyprocracy, for a nation that cherishes life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
2134	If he prescribed the medication, he is legally responsible, but it is possible that he does not actually have access to the records. Regardless, your access to your medical records is guaranteed by federal law. Whoever owned the facility would be responsible for maintaining those records. In general, I agree with these other guys. He knows he is in trouble and is trying to weasel out.
2135	I believe the birth mother should have the right to be anonymous. However, an intermediary could be contacted in the event of a medical emergency. Women need this safeguard so they won't feel pressured by the judgemental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It is very sad that abortions are frequently chosen for these reasons.
2136	I disagree because I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and now I have created a small fortune. I owe no one and will walk away from anyone who tries to take from me what I have worked for. My brother and I were the only white children in the projects. That was unfair. Take your cry for reparations to someone else. I simply do not agree.
2137	The Scarlet letter license plate will not pass because there are those that hold high political offices or other esteemed jobs that have been caught for that. Do you think that they want to drive around with a Scarlet letter license plate? This is the only reason this bill has repeatedly been defeated. As for Imani who answered before me, she'd better be glad she does not live where I do, because that is exactly what one of the judges in our county has people do. Personally, I would think it is a deterrent and would think long and hard about doing something wrong if I had to do something like that. If you commit a crime you will be required to pay society back one way or another.
2138	Many wish he would be, but the reality is if he did there would be great uproar. The American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower bracket earners. The woes would be unbearable! The economy of the United States would be negatively affected or even bought down lower that it already is. The fact is that Bush is using the "Born Again church" to his advantage. Is he a Christian? Very questionable, no signs of it. Hah! He is as much Christian as Bin Laden is Muslim.
2139	The phrase "all men are created equal" holds true, no matter your ancestry, race, or ethnic background. Everyone deserves equal opportunity to make their own decisions and be treated with dignity.
2140	It sounds like we are becoming a communistic country trying to pass a law like that. What does this country think it is doing by saying what a person can or cannot spend on food? Is it helping our economy? There is more to obesity than just buying too much food. Some obese people do not eat much, but what they are eating is junk and empty calories. Some try to buy healthy and get things like Slim Fast, which is full of preservatives and poisons. Some just do not exercise. Maybe we should pass a law for mandatory exercise! Or health and nutrition classes. Maybe we should stop selling a bunch of junk. Maybe we should make organic and natural foods more affordable.
2141	You need to prove that the other parent is not a good parent or is committing felonies. You had a child together and you will have to share parenting time with this person unless you can prove that this person is not a good parent or is committing felonies. In reality, this person deserves to have parenting time and influence in the course of this child's life.
2142	A private attorney in a murder case will cost between $30,000 and $50,000. If you do not have that amount of money, you may not have a choice. However, public defenders are adequate attorneys. Their main problem is that they are overworked. This gives them less time to devote to even the most important cases.
2143	You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents, you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or private investigator may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.
2144	First of all, what your stepson is doing is libel, because it is in written form. Slander is oral, which he may also be doing, but since he is sending letters, it's libel. If you're serious about stopping him, start with the police. Libel laws vary from state to state, so they will be able to tell you that. If it is a civil matter, speak with an attorney about bringing a case against your stepson and what a reasonable expectation of the outcome might be. It might not be worth the time, effort, and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.
2145	If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, and good people would not be poor.
2146	I have given up hope of a progressive movement in this country. I have defended Obama to all my conservative friends for six years while he has done things such as keep Guantanamo open, bail out the banks, pass the GOP alternative to single payer, keep the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA, etc. etc. Hillary Clinton will probably win the Democratic primary, and will probably be the next President, and if anything she will be even less progressive than Obama. Please, change my view before I become a 25 year old husk of a man.
2147	I love bulldogs and pugs in general, however due to designer breeding these dogs have terrible problems breathing which is probably a factor of why they sleep so much and probably is a cause for several of those health problems. I suppose there is optional surgery to increase airflow, but the vast majority of owners don't opt to do it. It breaks my heart to see these amazing dogs gasping for air, I can imagine all the health problems I'd have if I had to struggle with every breath. If I am misinformed please help, I'd love to own a beautiful bully but I'd feel terrible for all these reasons.
2148	I have concluded that universities are not here to serve humanity and every person's love for science or whatever subject they do, but instead it is a production line for the corporate world.
2149	We have been watching a CNN special in school about genocides after the Holocene. The piece believes that the United States should have intervened in the conflicts. I disagree. I think that things like this put the United States in a bad position. If we do nothing, we are viewed as irresponsible. If we go in, we look like we are oil seeking imperialists. I do not think the United States should be fighting other people's fights. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort themselves out. Change my mind! Thanks to anyone who responds.
2150	This may vary by country, but in my country, I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then walk by a £1/1kg bag of carrots, an 80p bag of celery, an £1/1kg bag of oats, and a 75p bag of bananas. You can buy several kilos of food here for less than £4. If you have a large enough freezer, you can even buy chicken breast in bulk that will last months. Then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (which is fine as a treat, but I see people do this several times a week).
2151	I believe that sports in general are a tremendous drain on time, energy, and money. They are a distraction from the things in our society that truly need our attention.
2152	Most people, rather than form an unbiased opinion about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons. This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds. However, most political discussions end with both parties saying what amounts to "Your arguments are less convincing than mine." There is some meta reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason, which is the *actual* reason for the person's opinion, is not rational.
2153	I was talking with my parents, who are both very religious, and realized that while religion does contribute to wars, the biggest problem religion has is that it prevents the spread of advancement in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (which deal with issues such as climate change and evolution), and society, specifically with same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, etc.
2154	I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non-hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I am not talking about Communism, in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism?
2155	I went deep sea fishing last weekend. We caught about ten to fifteen fish. We first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before -- then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and threw them in the water. I cannot find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through their face, fought for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over. I did not like it. Fishers, do you change my mind?
2156	I believe the Tories are money hungry bastards who do not care about anyone except themselves. Gove was a horrible education minister and now we have this woman who was previously minister of women and equality but who voted against gay marriage. She is highly in favor of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the wealthy and wealthy of the country. I doubt that anything will change from Gove's reign of terror - We may even see it get worse.
2157	I believe that natural rights, such as "...those not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable..." do not exist. I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth.
2158	I have always thought of someone recording a video while holding the device vertically as a mouth-breather. It is a small issue, but it bothers me that people do not take into consideration how the video will look when it is watched later on YouTube or Facebook. Many times people end up covering two-thirds of the screen with black bars, or even stretching and blurring the sides. These videos always look terrible. The only reason I have come up with is if the person recording only intends to ever watch it on the same device. But then again, why would you want a video that is only intended to be watched on a phone?
2159	After researching and talking to family and friends, I learned that there are many different opinions about whether or not to vaccinate. In my opinion, parents should be informed about the pros and cons of their decision and make an informed decision.
2160	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and have not found anything resembling a "center of consciousness" in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. This begs the question: external source of consciousness or internal source of consciousness?
2161	I am reminded of why I cannot stand soccer (football). While there are documented cases of corruption in other "major" team sports, soccer's corruption is on an entirely different level. Oscar-worthy flops, blown calls, reluctance to implement technology, documented match fixing, officials on the take, FIFA's pilfering of host nations, rampant racism, etc. are all evidence indicating that soccer (football) at best is the WWE of world sports and at worse the most corrupt of organized team sports.
2162	He is a great leader who did many things that the Germans of his time wished they could have done during World War I. He is a great leader who made Germany rise from the ashes like a phoenix and get revenge for Versailles. He also planned the Autobahn which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I believe that if it weren't for the horrors of genocide, Germans would be a lot more proud of their history.
2163	I would like to hear from people who have been surprised by a military member coming home.
2164	I contend that there is no basis for the idea of universal and inalienable rights, as there is no basis for any other construct humanity has created. While there can be some appeal to human nature, nearly all universal behavior that could be classified as rights only apply to the "in-group" and certainly none seem to apply to humanity as a whole. This is why law exists in general. It is an extension of tribal self-rule for larger groups. There is certainly nothing about the nature of reality that causes rights to exist. I'd like to hear some good arguments as to why rights are not constructs.
2165	I realize that this has been asked before but I'd like to get some fresh thoughts. So, the US has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). The US donates more money to charity/aid organizations than any other country. The US tends to be the entertainment capital of the world. The US has most of the greatest universities in the world. I get that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, etc). But that being said, for the US to not be the best country another country has to be declared the best. So who is it? The UK? China? Make your case.
2166	Neither of these Italian crooners were, despite their success, really gifted singers. IMO Between the two, Dino had a better voice, more range, and better tambour. His early inspirations, his model singers when he was an aspiring singer were more blues and jazz based. Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing far better than Martin. Frank also had better material, especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither are jazz singers. The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians, yet rarely have any of Dino's songs have.
2167	I am amazed that they haven't permanently put duct tape over Biden's mouth. The stupid things that come out of his mouth.
2168	We did not impeach George W. Bush, so why did we impeach Bill Clinton? He did nothing wrong. Bush sank us into debt, started wars that cost thousands of lives, and trashed our name worldwide. What Clinton did should have remained between him and Hill.
2169	We are all just people and if someone is attracted to someone of the same sex, that is their problem. I think that gay and lesbian couples are not hurting anyone, so they should be happy. You can argue that God made a man and woman, but I do not think that God would want you to be unhappy.
2170	PCs are cheaper and have more powerful hardware. Mac's use generic hardware, not specific Apple hardware. People also believe that Mac's break down or need to be replaced less often than PCs. However, if you ever work in an environment where Macs are networked together and used as the primary computer, you will see that Macs are just as susceptible to problems as PCs. In fact, we bought a number of Pro machines, which had a 100% failure rate in the three or so years they were used.
2171	The Lion King had more Oscar nominations than Aladdin, so there is that.
2172	A religious debate accomplishes nothing. Instead, insults are passed, and one side or the other is seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because somebody quotes scientific or Biblical "evidence" that may or may not exist or be as firm as it is made sound. Furthermore, speaking for both sides, both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so each side will just pick each other apart as able.
2173	California is the best! It is a land of opportunity, and according to the CIA, it would have the tenth largest economy in the world. It has some of the most beautiful natural landscapes and destinations in the world, and is the birthplace of technology.
2174	It is ZED people! When you are talking to someone over the phone and you need to spell something that has the letter ZED, it is clear as day when you say ZED. If you are talking to a Yankee and are forced to say ZEE, then you get a lot of "did you say V? Or was that a D?". Let us change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
2175	This revelation should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.
2176	The trendy music is basically what most young people are listening to. Right now it is rap music with constant references to money, cars, etc. They are so stupid they have those terrible songs that come wrapped together with some stupid dance like that little moron Solja Boy.
2177	Suicide is a tragedy that can be prevented.
2178	We see different colors everyday, but most of them are just shades of other colors.
2179	The world's corporate headquarters have been reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s, and in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts which are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.
2180	I do not see the point in making a change from an economic standpoint.
2181	Agents are the ones creating the "strategy", but if it is not favorable to them, then management is useless, they need to come up with another plan... unless the "power" kicks in, then agents will only be able to follow.
2182	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth, you need proof to validate your claim. If you refuse to give your fellow man this proof, you're hiding the truth from him. You hinder his or her ability to encounter the truth, and quite frankly, if he or she was to die thereafter and was condemned for eternity, isn't your blood on your hands? You had the means to save them but didn't.
2183	Evolution is backed by science including DNA tracing and archaeological findings such as Lucy. Evolution simply states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment. Humans have most likely evolved from apes, because their DNA is very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is not the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when absolutely everything is discovered about it. Gravity is only a scientific theory, but it is largely believed to be true. Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.
2184	My date and I had a wonderful experience here. My date loved the prime Rib and her mashed potatoes. My burger was cooked to perfection. The only downside was the Mac and cheese. I spoke with the manager and he said that it was a new item and they were working on it. We will definitely be back.
2185	The atmosphere is very cool, as if you are in a wooden cabin. It fits in excellent with the Canadian theme. I have had a few dishes here, the lobster roll, PEI mussels, and boneless back rib burger, all of which I would recommend. The daily noodle is scarce, however, I have missed it on all three visits.
2186	We went in on a Monday night. There were several servers there, however, none came to take our drink order for 15 minutes. The manager asked how we were doing, but he continued walking. Why ask how I am doing when you clearly do not care or want to know why, which is evidenced by your pace around the restaurant.
2187	The food was amazing and our server Samantha was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have gone back and questioned it, but we did not keep our receipt, so there was no way to prove it.
2188	I tried two curries and pad Thai and gave it five stars because the waiter made a new dish with less spice.
2189	I had a bad experience here. The place was not busy, but the staff was overworked. The food was not very good and the mushroom stroganoff was inedible. We had a group of 12 people and the patio was not very enjoyable.
2190	I was extremely disappointed in the food portions for the price point. Perhaps I am just bitter that this place took over Messinis. I gave 1 star because I had high expectations and it failed.
