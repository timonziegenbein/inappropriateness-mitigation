0	Students should wear what they like and feel free about their clothes.
1	People cannot be forced to wear school uniforms. Each person has their own wish whether or not they want to wear school uniforms. I think each principal should reconsider this issue.
2	That form of argument degrades this forum and will cause the arguments to fall to the lowest common denominator. I dispute your claim from personal experience, if nothing else, that makes it disputable. I think Yahoo! has chat rooms more attuned to your style of debate. Check them out.
3	I would not turn her in because she is my wife and we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what she did, then I could not do that to her.
4	I would not turn in my spouse because the woman I married killed someone does not make her a terrible person.
5	TV is terrible except for Spongebob. However, most of the television is terrible so I would have to say books based on that.
6	My English teacher said that books improve your literature.
7	You save money by reading a book. You do not need to buy any devices to read a book, and you do not need to use electricity.
8	I think that books are better than television because you can put yourself in a whole North Yorkshire and it is educational.
9	Books enlighten the soul. Books throw the mind into a series of questions. Books take the reader to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. They change your perspective on life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It is as bad as nicotine.
10	India has strong military neighbors, China and Pakistan. India has territorial disputes and fought four wars for this. India has become tense with China due to territorial disputes and India interference in Pakistan. Pakistan has long term plans for the Pak China Economic Corridor and Gawadar Mega Oil City.
11	India is a terrible country.
12	India is a good adopter but a bad developer. The leader should be a great developer.
13	Russell Peters is very good at making fun of these people.
14	According to a recent report 50% scientists in NASA are indian IITians. Just imagine that if those scientists will join ISRO then India's status,value and astronomical knowledge of India will definetly increase.
15	I would rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful.
16	Being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by everyone. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who would frustrate me daily. On the other hand, a bad father would be with you in your thoughts forever.
17	Raffles was followed by Farquhar during his visit to Singapore. This shows that Raffles saw Singapore before Farquhar became the founder.
18	Raffles had written his discovery wrongly as 29 February 1819. However, it was later corrected. He thought he had discovered Singapore on his first journey to India.
19	Without Raffles, Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
20	Raffles established a local magistrate in Singapore. This magistrate led to activities such as public gambling and slavery being controlled. Farquar protected Singapore from the Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
21	That is interesting because the burden of proof rests with you to prove that we are still evolving. I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years.
22	I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was amazed at the miracle of our bodies. When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came about by a mere accident or order of circumstances?
23	I voted for evolution, because creationism is easier to accept due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.
24	Believing evolution is like believing the puzzle can be broken by pouring the pieces out because two pieces are stuck together.
25	The extensions leak memory like a sieve. An opened session of Firefox 2.0.0.1 uses 250 MB of memory under Task Manager on Windows.
26	PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you are an adult. But when you are a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy and lie on the couch all day, then you are most likely to get sick and unfit.
27	Founders should be leaders who are respected by the organization or group they are managing. William Farquhar was a good leader. However, when he was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more competent leader.
28	I know many children get adopted but many do not and it might be better off to have an abortion to let them suffer. Who are we to decide on one woman's pregnancy?
29	Who is it that judges what is right and wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
30	We are evolving. Look at this one. Our small toe is becoming increasingly smaller. Eventually, it will end up losing it.
31	I understand that people have religious beliefs and that is fine. However, it is scientifically proven that evolution is correct. What is your point?
32	Why do we not have talking monkeys? That is a red herring. Monkeys have not evolved to talk because they are incapable of speech. However, we, on the other hand, have evolved to talk. Yes, if we are descended from monkeys that doesn't stop them from existing. We are a branch on the tree of life.
33	Porn is not wrong, but if it is really wrong, then it should be "illegal".
34	Porn is not inherently wrong because it can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice. It really is just as simple as that.
35	Yes, they are either virgins or still live at home with their mothers and cannot have porn.
36	It is not wrong, and if you are talking about the actors doing the scene, it is their choice. They like doing it, and it is not degrading to women who want to do it. We have freedom of expression, you know, and it also helps some of us to be open about sex.
37	There was a rapper who said he was the people's champ. When you want to be successful, you need to worry about the common good. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when you always think about your self and your personal pursuits, you tend to become conceited and become an A jerk.
38	I believe they are different ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do. I feel happy helping others, but that does not mean I help every person in front of me. I try to do what I think is best and good to make someone happy.
39	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it is better to help other people. It makes me feel good to be doing something good in my life.
40	It is a good thing because it shows that the school and everyone else accepts each other no matter where they come from, who they are, or what religion they are.
41	Wearing school uniforms, you can be certain that you are going to school to study, and not show off your fashion sense.
42	Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status based on personality, not looks. I admit wearing what you want is fun and creative, but it is only fun if everyone can do it. For some children, that is not the case and they cannot afford to live up to their peers standards.
43	The school uniform is a very good idea, why? Because the school uniform makes pupils concentrate on their education rather than their clothes, and I believe that it instills discipline among pupils. It also makes pupils with different material statuses more equal.
44	If you do not have a father, then you have no way of knowing that you will never feel the same way about someone for the rest of your life.
45	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. A lousy father is better than none.
46	I would rather have the hope that my father could be a good father than know that I will never meet him. I would be too curious as to what kind of father he could have been.
47	Atlas would drop the world for a chance to shake his hand.
48	The increase in bottled water production has led to water shortages in areas near bottling plants. Additionally, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.
49	Water bottles can be used for many different purposes. For example, they can be used as clothing or carpet. It is easy to just fill a cup with water and then use it again.
50	TV is better than reading books from the olden days.
51	Television is better than books.
52	I love TV because you can watch whatever you want and it is the best. You can also watch DVDs and play on Playstation.
53	Most Americans recycle more than half of their bottle waters.
54	Without plastic water bottles, there is no sunshine. There is only darkness everyday.
55	We will be able to ban water bottles until we get out of this recession.
56	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called "civil unions." "Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal." This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly. Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact? "...why challenge any assumption?" I'm not arguing that law should not change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario.
57	There is no such thing as "gay marriage." Marriage is only between a man and a woman.
58	I am ashamed to admit that India is rich due to slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich until the British came and took everything away. We were left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America. Soon, everyone will have education and India will excel.
59	India is a secular state, and people from all communities reside here. Therefore, India has knowledge of almost all countries and the way they live. Therefore, it can easily lead all people of the world without creating any nuissance among anyone.
60	How can Indians say that India does not have the potential to lead the world? India is heaven on earth and only India has the potential to lead the world. Believe yourself and hard work. India will become a potential leader in the world.
61	I say no because spanking does not solve the problem. Anyone can get over a spanking quickly and do the same thing again. It is better to be strict than to abuse a child.
62	It depends on the severity of the act. Of course I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him free, but if I knew it was a malicious act instead of self defense or to defend his family or belongings I would most likely leave and not have anything to do with it.
63	I would turn them in because I do not think that killing someone and then letting them go is wrong. Additionally, I do not want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
64	I would turn them in regardless of the risk. Any person who commits murder should not get away with it because if they did it once they can do it again. Also, if I do not turn them in, then I will not know that later on in life I might be a victim.
65	The government does not have a place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body. However, the government does have a right.
66	I am pro-life. What is the question for those who are pro-life? Is the child in the mother's womb alive or not? If not, how do you know?
67	How can you argue against that? In Nebraska, abortion is legal, as long as the fetus is killed at the time of birth.
68	There should be no argument about this, if you see a fetus as a living being that has been created in a very intimate way. You should not be changing what Mother Nature, God, fate or whatever has decided for you. And if you did not want to get pregnant in the first place, you should not have sex or use protection. There are some women that get raped and it is very unfortunate, but they should give the child up for adoption. It is not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the guinea pig be responsible for the ultimate price of its life?
69	There are many ways to not get pregnant. Condoms are 99% effective for men and women, morning-after pills are 75% effective, the patch, pill, and other forms of ways to not get pregnant. It is the woman's fault that she did not do it. And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they should have pro-life, but with exceptions for women that get raped so that it is fair all-around.
70	If a woman is raped it is a good argument. However, why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime? If the woman does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I do not understand why you would kill the baby. The emotional trauma would happen without the baby.
71	I believe homosexual marriage should be allowed. People who do not want it to be allowed simply do not like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice.
72	Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity or Judaism, and those that predated Christianity. The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, but that is difficult to prove.
73	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle if you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" if you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."
74	If you do not like gay marriage and think it is wrong, then do not watch a gay couple kiss. Who are you to tell people that their views are incorrect and that they must change their feelings? Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to themselves.
75	I think that personal pursuit is more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. This may seem selfish but once you reach a point where you are good at what you do, you can help others do the same.
76	Politics is very useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretically. Why do terrorists blow up every city here? I mean are they frisked every time you leave your house? No. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. It is supposed to be built by the people it governs. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You do not have to always be right but take time to learn. It is not politics that destroys people, it is the media projecting it.
77	I am a direct threat to the government Bush is trying to create.
78	It is as old as known history. The earliest civilizations practiced it back in Mesopotamia, which is older than Egypt. It was not created by the "white devil" that you hear about today.
79	Do you want to have contact with your children? Then you need to step up and fight for them. California is fair when it comes to fathers. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you unless you are found unfit for some reason. You need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction from the lastest court order. Good luck and you really need to fight for this.
80	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably speak with one, but my two cents are that you must not exercise any of the rights granted to you in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
81	Your brother is in jail for a reason. Maybe if he had contributed to society instead of committing crimes he would not be in jail.
82	Yes, if you execute a murderer, he will never escape. He will never hurt anyone else, and it helps the victim's family heal. The thought that a murderer is still alive grates on the minds and heartsof the victims.
83	Skating in general is not illegal, but in certain public places it is illegal. I used to work at a store where we had kids skate on our sidewalk and they nearly killed some of our elderly customers. That is why it is illegal in some places because you could run over people who are just walking around.
84	You cannot legislate how someone should feel about another person. While racism is bad, it is inherently protected by the First Amendment. Try to avoid the question of "why isn't the government doing anything about it?" They love to take away freedoms rather than protect them, so I would rather they stay out of it. Free speech allows civilized people to keep track of the crazies.
85	Usually, that isn't the question men are asking. Maybe you are not the father, but the mom. My bad. If you were the dad, you could always just give extra money that didn't go through the courthouse. Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluate the amount per month owed. Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't. Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own. You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own.
86	Unfortunately, I agree that unless there is something in it for us, it is a hard sell to convince the United States to send troops to protect the world. The problem is that we always get caught up in the quagmire of international politics and never fully commit to a mission, thus we fall short and it looks like a half-hearted attempt with consequences that we have a hard time stomaching.
87	If you are connected to city sewers, you have to pay. Check with your city councilman. They probably negotiated a billing delay when they were first installed, even if it was a city oversight. It is a service you have to pay for. They charged me extra sewer when I filled my pool and that was 6000 gallon worth of water even though it didn't go down the drain. If they can charge you, they will. Especially if all your neighbors are connected, they do not give you a choice.
88	Unlike what most people believe, most states do not have laws addressing minimum ages to babysit or minimum ages that children can be left alone. Unless someone can cite a specific Illinois law, chances are the answers you get here are of little value. While 15 or 16 might seem like reasonable numbers, that does not mean the answers are correct on the law.
89	In a free society, there is no such thing as the "right" to not be subjected to offensive things. However, if you read the newspaper, browse the web, watch TV, etc., you will be offended in the West. However, you do have the right to protest peacefully, picket, and rally other people to do the same. If their "deen" (a Muslim word for faith) is strong, they should not worry about what some non-Muslim has to say about their religion.
90	I feel that it is totally against everything that is American. For example, how about everyone strapping a GPS system to their legs so the government knows where everyone is. And yes, cell phones. Besides this, the government is saying it is all in public safety, but I do not know how safe I feel if someone is listening to my phone calls.
91	I would say not all foreigners are unrealistic, but it would depend on what country they are from. Just as the entire world has favs and non favs, I think the non favs for countries already know who they are and why. If a nation is violent and not good for the world and the government, liars and steals and kills innocent humans, then it is not well liked by the people either. It is the government that causes it and their people that pay for it.
92	I think that a standard driver's license will make the country safer against terrorists. Many of the 9/11 terrorists had drivers licenses that they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you are putting in your bill. The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. The program will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, so it will not need tax revenues. It will actually remove a burden from the states.
93	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader? Well, let's quote Che. He once wrote "you can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea." He was writing about how the idea of freedom from oppression is catching on and will spread regardless of attempts to stamp it out. There is still oppression in the world, and there is still a thirst for freedom from it. So why not? The same basic conditions apply as when he was alive.
94	In one sense you bring up an interesting point. However, let me challenge you with a broader concept......do our Laws reflect our morality, or does morality stem from the Laws we make each other abide by? In their written series of civilization, Will and Ariel Durant made the point that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbor needed them. Consider that a bit as you ponder your own question. In my personal opinion, I do believe that faith can and should inform public policy.
95	The court will hold the conviction addulled, void, and overturned as if it no longer exists. Expungement of the records is another matter that requires more legal work. Even if that were to be granted, there will always be a paper trail and the fact that someone was arrested in the first place will always be part of that trail. It is practically impossible to get rid of all of the records, even with a court order.
96	It is not an appropriate function of government to make us "be good"; if it were, we would soon have laws forcing us to exercise and eat spinach. Our current drug policy is doing more harm than the drugs themselves.
97	You are not racist for wanting your family to have the same rights as the others. In fact, you should have more rights if you were born and bred in the country. However, unfortunately, that is not the case here in Britain. We actually have less rights and receive less benefits if we become unemployed or sick as compared to the imigrants who get much more of our money that we worked for which they take.
98	It may just be that Michigan is a bad economy and unemployment is high, but there are plenty of people with criminal records who would not be hired.
99	This is an interesting question in light of the laws that punish some people more severely than others for their opinion, even when they commit the same crime.
100	Why on earth do people answer questions when they have no idea what they are talking about? Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good because they are not permitted to give legal advice. Why do you say that the judgment is expired? What state do you live in? In California, judgements expire after 10 years. The only way to get it off your credit report is to petition the court to have it expunged. Chances are really slim on that. Otherwise, you are probably just going to have to deal with it being there.
101	I think you have a case. Did you happen to take pictures of all of these "repairs"? Sometimes the threat of small claims court will get them to write a cheque. You may have to pay a lawyer to write the court documents, unless the clerk is willing to help you out. You did agree to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality. The fact that they tried to repair the stand indicates they insured the UNIT part also. Good luck.
102	You need to protect yourself and your family if you have a person break into your home in the middle of the night. Even if you do call the police, you could be killed a hundred times over in five minutes.
103	I think prostitution is overrated. If a woman wants to have sex with many men and gets nothing, she is considered a whore. However, if the men throw her a few dollars, she is a prostitute. Why give it up for free?
104	We should close our borders and not allow these people to be taken care of. They can learn to speak English before coming over to her to take the test. If I go to a foreign country I do not expect them to take the time to teach me their language. It is not realistic. They need to go home and fix their country, while we try to fix ours.
105	There are many types of abuse. Perhaps she does not want you around anymore. Perhaps it is payback for something you did to her. This restraining order can be a piece of mind, "If he is not around me, he cannot hurt me anymore." It may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier.
106	Firstly, cops do not piss you off. You choose to be. If you choose not to be pissed off, then you will not be. It is called a victim mentality. You own your emotions, no one else.
107	I believe that crime needs to be controlled and I do not personally see it as a violation of one's right's to be stopped when it is deemed to be suspicious.
108	You are mistaken, they have not been shut down in India. The ban is only in Maharastra. The government had received complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not looking after the families. Also many criminal activities took place at these bars. You must be aware of the Tarannum case or the Telgi case where the monthly income was arouned 1 lac and the Telgi would throw away nereby 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on such type of criminal activities the Gov of Maharastra had put a ban on these ladies bars.
109	The Indian Wars were more of a war of attrition, and we have contributed to the land.
110	Another thing to think about. While some judges can be bought, they are not the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliation, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case separately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! Scary stuff.
111	Men in many developed countries have the legal right to abort in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father.
112	I have grown up around religious people who always told me abortion was wrong, murder, and immoral. But I slowly realized that it's not really a fully formed human, how could it be murder? This never made any sense, it's someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Do not shame them into having a baby based on religious views.
113	I do not understand how the adversarial judicial system helps to get at the truth. It seems more about how well an argument is presented than the facts of the case. The way that both parties draw conclusions and attempt to manipulate the jury with emotional language into believing them seems deceptive. In addition, the jury, who are basically untrained (in terms of weighing evidence), people decide which argument is better seems to be a poor method of getting at the truth.
114	I don't think humanity has another 100 years left. I want to believe that things will be alright, but when you keep hearing worse and worse news about the environmental degradation of the planet (even if you are still somehow a climate-change denier, you have to admit the oceans are massively polluted and huge amounts of fish are dying, the air in some parts of the world like China is almost unbreathable and getting worse, etc.), it's hard to see humans coming out of this okay.
115	I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned. By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a "joke" to those who attend in attire.
116	I understand that the Wilhelm scream is an "in-joke" but I do not think that it should be used anymore without the audience acknowledging it.
117	Prostitution stings should be illegal, and drug deal stings. Anything that does not have a victim, and there is no physical harm/bad intentions. If a police officer witnesses a drug deal or a prostitution deal, that is one thing. However, setting people up for these crimes, it seems as if the police are "shopping" for criminals to take in, baiting and reeling them in. Often times, these people may have gone about their days without committing a crime.
118	The title is self explanatory. Vladimir Putin is the head of a disappointed ex-empire, willing to gain its former glory. The Russian people are traditionally obedient one, willing to submit to an autocratic will, and ready to devote themselves to general patriotic ideals. The guy seems very determined not to conform with the Western moral and politic values.
119	With the exception of the moon where the dirt bike is amazing to rack up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave the down force keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailor made for those levels. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill. CMV!
120	First of all, we people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min? I can see that many people in reddit disagree with this, however, and I want to know why, so I can form a balanced opinion. So CMV!
121	I am under the impression that a man's first love is his strongest love and every subsequent love is a bit weaker each time. Additionally, each subsequent love is trying to match the intensity of the first love, a bit like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time.
122	I don't think Michael Jackson's death was truly accidental, but it seems to be the norm for people who die young. To see one's bad deeds scrubbed away on Earth with no one to speak of them again just feels wrong and downplays their earthly acts. I think speaking ill of the dead who did bad things should totally be acceptable and death should not be a cleanse to one's legacy. Am I alone here?
123	I believe some actions should have permanent consequences, and that we have morally compromised ourselves in making exceptions to this. I fundamentally contradict that every individual has a right to live. If you are willing to put someone else's right to life in jeopardy, then you have demonstrated that you are a net negative impact on society, and that as a whole we would all be better off if you were dead.
124	I am not talking about my parents here. They are wonderful people. I mean grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (Not brothers or sisters either, only child). Most of my parents' argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. It's similar to having some stranger say they would do anything for you.
125	If you are on a beer run with friends and one of them forgets their ID but they are not purchasing, requiring them to show ID is both useless and inconvenient.
126	I believe John Hammond had a great vision, but was poorly advised by his HR department. Hammond's Park would be a major boost for the economy of the Dominican Republic and any other nation where it opens up.
127	Video games should be treated like drugs. Millions of lives are affected because people are not monitored or do not use them in moderation. Children in particular are consumed and obsessed with them, it takes over their lives and social skills. It is sad. I feel strongly about this. I went through the same thing as a child and I wish more than anything to go back and change it. Also, I'm grateful because now I want to make sure that this does not happen to anyone again.
128	It is pointless. I do not see any positive things about it. It is not the best way to communicate with people since we have phones, email, instant messenger, video calls, and video chats. The apps have no meaning and are not that fun. I also do not understand why anyone would want to post about their feelings or what they are doing and shout it out to everyone. I do not care if Billy Bob is going shopping. It is also a place for online and maybe real life stalkers and maybe future stalkers.
129	If Iraq has taught us anything, it is that brutal dictators have their place in the world. If this administration had any brains at all, they would have had a Delta squad hunkered down right under the gallows with a stepstool, ready to spirit Saddam away from his rightful place at the capital. It takes a mean bastard to run a 160,000 square-mile lunatic asylum.
130	Professor X could probably take them all out by himself without all the other gods like marvel characters.
131	Yes, it will recover, provided the government stops its meddling and bailout measures. It was things like this that turned the potentially temporary market drop into a huge and horrid Great Depression. I wish lawmakers HAD TO TAKE AT LEAST SOME INTERESTED HISTORY WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL.
132	I hear all too often that science is 'playing God'. We as a species have superceded the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it.
133	Unless every single gun that is issued legally is tested with ballistics before being issued so that any bullet fired from a licensed gun can be traced, if found intact, then guns pose a threat because there is no way for those bullets to be traced back to the owners so they can account for the shots they fired. It is like giving someone a Jaguar as long as they promise never to let it out of their site. It is a waste of money.
134	I do not know where you live, but here in Southern California we have pizza delivery services available until 3 am. I would rather go to Del Taco over Taco Smell or Taco Hell. Tacos were $5 for a buck back then.
135	I see that there are actually no arguments, so I'm just going to clarify a few things. Even though principals do obtain the right to search (for drug tests, even making the student take off his/her socks if the dog smells something on that student), they only retain that right in the event of reported drugs or crime, or in the case that sniffer dogs checks are enacted and the dog smells something. There are restrictions - a principal can't just demand to search a student's possessions on whim.
136	Firstly, bribing a child is defined as doing something like this: Now David, if you just put your shoes and coat on, mommy will buy you a toy after we are done at the doctor's office. Karen, if you take the garbage out, we will stop at the store and buy the video you wanted. Karen, if you get off the swing, we will stop at the store and buy the video you wanted. Karen, if you get off the swing, we will stop at the store and buy the video you wanted. Karen, if you just eat your vegetable and I will give you extra icecream. This type of thing being said after pleeding with your child to do what you want.
137	I have discussed this with my brother several times. I think that the name 'Sublime' does not accurately describe the band to which it refers. First, there are multiple definitions for the word. "elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc." certainly does not describe the band. But what about "supreme or outstanding?" There is a certain amount of opinion involved in this. But the general consensus, I think, would be that the name does not describe the band. I do not have anything against the band, or their choice of name. In fact, I like a few of their songs.
138	It is an art and takes time to perfect, just like cooking, so starting early would mean perfecting it sooner. It does not necessarily mean that they are going to be drunks later on in life, but it is still up to the person's discipline. There are a lot of young drunks who were never bartenders.
139	What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate himself was sorrowful and did not sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. In that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene. And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption. The whole controversy is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead.
140	The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity. For example, if a dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college, the dog's reaction to this person returning home after being away for six months is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact, the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance.
141	I have a strong opinion that before having children, prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and IQ tests. Children being brought into this world need a good foundation to start a successful life with.
142	The reason marriage should be kept sacred is for what the man and woman will produce, a child. It is the best and most natural arrangement to raise a happy and healthy child. The continuation of the family unit a man and a woman and a woman are not going to grow more branches of the tree, so it should not be called marriage.
143	If our monetary supply is allowed to continue, the likely result will be hyperinflation and another depression. Furthermore, every nation in history that has switched to fiat currency has eventually gone bankrupt because the government couldn't resist the urge to hyperinflate the monetary supply and make all of the money useless. Those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.
144	I believe that there should be a maximum number of posts per day, possibly having someone else wait until the following day, either through a filtered bucket or something like that, so that people have a chance to read current ones. Too many debaters are putting time and effort into the current open debates, and then having them fall further down the list, leading to less people reading and responding to them.
145	The iPhone is the 21st Century, while the Blackberry is an outdated technology.
146	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music, but America has birthed greater music. The whole bedrock of modern popular music is founded upon Blues and Jazz which originated in the United States. Without Blues and Jazz there would not be any Beatles, Rolling Stones or any other major British band prior to 1977.
147	Obama has good judgement, steady in crisis, curious minded, cares about all the people, not just the wealthy, wants to build a green economy, PRESIDENTIAL. McCain is an old dated thinker, not curious minded, too ingrained into the system he claims to want to change. He has stolen every good position he has in this election from Obama, running a vile campaign.
148	While prohibition was not a strictly "good thing", it was a good thing for our country to go through.
149	No, I would not want to.
150	I find it over rated and I would not go there for the fries. They have peanuts in small paper bowls that you can munch on while you wait. The decor is like a 1950's diner.
151	I was in the Pulp store at 6:53 pm and the clerk behind the counter informed me that they had already sanitized the juice machine for the night and it did not close until 9 pm. What a horrible experience and terrible customer service. Pulp does not close until 9 pm.
152	I have been here before, but now that Yama sushi has become so popular and big, the sushi has 2x more rice than before and less fish. The service has dropped to something impermissible. Additionally, they recently received a B- Health Inspection rating for 16 violations, most of which were the fish not being kept at proper temperatures. Go somewhere else or make sure you get good service.
153	I went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. I was hoping for a better experience but I was disappointed.
154	We waited only 20 minutes to get our oysters, but they were not even shucked correctly. I would only go back if there was not a line.
155	My coworker ordered chicken chow mein and it took an hour to get our food. The delivery driver did not have change and he dropped our tea all over the place.
156	My husband and I went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary. The steak was rancid and it ruined the entire evening. We decided to become vegan as a result.
157	I believe that wearing uniform is bad because it is not helping students express their individuality. It is also very uncomfortable and during winter time it may be very cold.
158	I have no more to say, but Firefox is much better.
159	I prefer Firefox over the other options.
160	Honestly, firefox works better. It has a tabbed interface, lacks activeX, and RSS support. The internet is trying to still catch up to it, though.
161	I love the tabs, the way it remembers passwords, and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar. It is much better than MS.
162	From a design standpoint, Firefox wins the Pretty Browser battle. There are so many beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox' is the clear-cut winner.
163	I love Firefox and have defended it, but this site is breaking it.
164	I do not know, because it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense, I would not tell the police, but if she committed murder, I would tell the police.
165	I would turn him in for murdering someone. I would try to persuade him to turn himself in, but if that didn't happen, I would have to take responsibility for him. I would also not want to feel the guilt of knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me, I wouldn't have killed someone.
166	I would not, because I would have taken a vow to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything, I would be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.
167	No, I would not be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone, you would do anything to help them, especially if it was an accident. However, if he killed someone just because he felt like killing someone, it may be a little different, because I would not want him to go nuts and kill me too.
168	Books offer improvement with grammar and spelling skills, as well as being more creative. TV is all done to you, while books allow you to imagine the characters and the setting with your own creativity. Additionally, you can take books anywhere and everywhere without disrupting anyone.
169	I do not prefer India to be leading the world in the near future. Yes India has the potential, but corruption, this quota system (not helpful to anyone), and the main reason for brain drain do not help India in the matter.
170	It is better to be fatherless. Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless.
171	I would rather be without a father who is not good but does absolutely nothing. Most kids look up to their fathers but if they are not good fathers, then why have them around? It just means that the kid will want to be like his father.
172	Raffles should have been the founder of Singapore because he was the leader and had more rights than Farquhar. However, Farquhar did not carry out his duties responsibly and allowed slaves, cockfighting, and murders everywhere in Singapore. Singapore was so poorly developed that Raffles was unhappy.
173	Pornography is wrong. It is unhealthy for some people and can lead to guilt and lust. Pornography promotes the fact that sex is totally based on pleasure, but it is actually based on love and affection also. Pornography inspired numerous crimes that sometimes absconded the rights and virginity of many people.
174	Are you a Christian, or anything? If not, then who's to stop you? For the record, yes it's wrong. Unfortunately, it's impossible to argue that, if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs.
175	Why do you assume that God needs to function within the constraints of time when accusing him of wasting his time?
176	Until FF comes preinstalled on PCs, IE will continue to dominate.
177	If Firefox is the best then why do people always try to have IE compatible sites?
178	I was an IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. I don't find any other significant advantages in using FireFox except for the fact that it has tabs, which is not available in IE. Additionally, now that IE7 has the tabs feature, along with add-ons, it makes it better than FireFox.
179	Fire Fox does not allow certain pop-ups on certain websites. You need Internet Explorer to install such websites.
180	I prefer to use FireFox, but I am unsure if all sites will work well with FireFox. I will choose IE until it is mainstream.
181	Yes, because it is a fun activity on the school day, that we get to have fun and at the same time, do our exercise, and lose the weight we have been gaining, not all of it, but it would help.
182	The lack of physical education in our high school has caused many students to be out of shape and have developed bad habits. As our first year in sports, our sports athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre season conditioning and they quote "If we had PE conditions would be easier and would have made conditioning simple." The lack of exercise had caused them to only accomplish only three push-ups.
183	I think it is interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER have not responded to my explanation of why I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion. It is interesting how people just ignore what they can't or don't want to argue against. If you are going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they have already addressed.
184	I support pro-life because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold against the government.
185	No one has mentioned that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those pregnancies, then abortions will be prevented. Wouldn't that make both parties happy?
186	I am confused about the pro-life position.
187	Why is it mostly older white men who are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Why are most abortionists pro-death penalty? Jon Jax, 71
188	I would like to remind creationists that they are supposed to click the "Convinced Me" link if they are convinced that creationism is true. However, some of you seem to be clicking everything on the right hand side. This will not help you win the debate.
189	All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. They are theological claims.
190	You have lost me. 99% of what you say speaks in favor of evolution and against creationism. At most, you point out that science doesn't have all the answers and that there may easily be a halfway point between faith and science where evolution and creationism can co-exist. A great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea.
191	Not it is not, but believing in "Creationism" and "God" is like believing that a puzzle can be solved by waving a magic wand. I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers would he? You clearly do not understand evolution. Read a book or two.
192	Whoever said porn degrades women is a fool. They get compensated well, and some girls like what they do. Without sex and porn, you may not have been born.
193	I notice that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is ebil 'n' degrading" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. As if there is no such thing as porn *actors*. Men do not count. Porn is a form of entertainment.
194	Pornography is not wrong, as long as you are not doing it behind your partner's back. It is only degrading to the women who choose to pose.
195	I believe that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because most people tend to look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before looking out for others won't do a lot of good in the long run.
196	This is very bad, as the uniforms are also cost effective.
197	I think school uniforms are a good idea. Yes, I agree that many pupils do not like them, but they have a lot of benefits. As others have pointed out, children at first do not have to think about what to wear, because it is a problem for teenagers.
198	I would prefer not to have a father who is not my role model. The damage to my personality would be far greater than being fatherless.
199	I think that it is better to have a father who is lousy, because I consider my father on a low level of lousy, and I think that I am doing just fine. I think that it is better to know that you have a father. I think that not knowing him or what he looks like would be an insecure topic in my life, so, in my opinion, just to know that you have a father would be better.
200	I would rather have a lousy father than be fatherless, because I would have the tranquility of knowing who my father is rather than spending my whole life wondering who he is.
201	A drop of water is worth more than a sack of gold to a thirsty man.
202	Yes, it is creating serious environmental issues. When people finally realize that it is hurting us as humans, perhaps they will not want that plastic after all.
203	The major water producing companies are stealing water from our lakes and in doing so are killing habitats for animals that like water, like platypus.
204	The other side is posting song lyrics, that has nothing to do with water.
205	He does not give high fives, he only gives high sixes. He is the Godfather. He once taught a German Shepherd to bark in Spanish.
206	I believe books are better. I believe I can fly.
207	I think that television is good because it is faster than reading.
208	Jesus loves plastic water bottles and you cannot argue with that.
209	I am pretty sure that thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how its unfair.
210	India is projected to grow faster than any country in the world after 2012.
211	India can speak English better than ordinary English man. British and American speech includes a lot of grammatical mistakes, so who is better, Indians. "truth is stranger than fiction."
212	We should not forget Lord Rama, Krishna, Vishvamitr, etc. These give a wide view that India will be the Vishvguru in the future.
213	Yes, with a rapidly growing population and a growing economy India is in line with China to become the greatest economic powers in the world.
214	Neither. Agnostic is the correct answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't, but they can never know. I personally believe there isn't a God, but I cannot prove this definitively.
215	I do not believe in Atheism, I need at least some evidence before I believe in magic.
216	I am an atheist because I believe that all human beings have one life that should be enjoyed and preserved for all future generations.
217	Christianity is perhaps the most vile ideal to poison the minds of men. It's uses, motives, and fictional stories are quite plainly immoral.
218	I apologize if I missed that. Did I mention that Christianity condones slavery?
219	It is ok to spank a child, but only to the point where you can hurt them and should not be used repeatedly.
220	I believe some parents should spank their children only when necessary, because sometimes that is the only way to teach children the correct way and listen.
221	Spanking should not be an option for disciplining a child. Parents have a lot of other options before spanking. It is better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
222	Spanking children is bad for their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children. It does not make sense.
223	I will turn him in to the police because he committed a murder and it is a sin. Maybe if he is arrested, he will feel guilty about what he has done and try not to repeat it. And also, how can I trust a murderer? He could be lying to me and possibly could kill me for someone else in the future. Just by confiding in me does not make him clean and innocent.
224	If you had a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm, would you cut it off just so you could remember that you were old enough to do so? If you are actually safe, you would say no, and if you say yes, you need to see a doctor.
225	When people condemned consensual-cannibalism in Africa, did they think of these people's right to their bodies? No. Why should abortion be any different?
226	What I do not understand is how people rationalize taking life. It just does not make any sense.
227	I say let gay people experience the joys of divorce, split of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make civil unions illegal; it makes it too easy to "walk away" from a relationship and encourages roomates to be "couples" to help a buddy out with benefits. Civil unions are gone, gay marriage is in!
228	If gays are allowed to get married and do whatever they want, why can't heterosexuals?
229	One reason is that so many more people now agree with this view.
230	If you desire to see a world full of all these goodness, you must be the spark that starts the fire.
231	I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they are blood.
232	At the moment I would have to choose a personal pursuit. I have goals set and I would like to accomplish them before I can begin to help others. Although I enjoy helping others, it is me who I must help first.
233	I believe that we should be able to die with dignity. While there are obvious needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, then they should be allowed to request medication to end their life. I have watched relatives die of cancer; no one deserves to be forced to go through that process unwillingly.
234	I don't like the fact that we have to choose our candidates based on party affiliation. I would rather have the facts as to how the candidate voted on all issues when they were in government. This way you know if they voted for what you want them to do on the issues that are important to you. What was their absent record? After all, aren't we all their bosses to some extent we put them in office. I don't like the fact that they give themselves raises when they are not needed.
235	If the internet is still so new, laws and policies are being created as we speak. If you aren't sure if they will be OK with it, ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would be the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well.
236	I believe that a person can get in trouble with the police if he or she is accused of bothering another person sexually.
237	I completely agree with you, these days, DNA is easier to prove someone guilty, so when it is proven that someone is 100% guilty, I will hang em! Also, paedophiles are the lowest of the low. As for the Indians, it may have been proven to not prevent further people killing, but at least it is less of a burden on the tax payer supporting scum like that in prison.
238	I detest it, but I find it necessary since my husband and I own an electrical company that offers 24-hour service. We get a lot of calls on our cell phones at night since we have our land line forwarded to our cells when we are not at the office. However, we always put our phones on silent or vibrate when we are in a public place so that we do not disturb anyone around us.
239	I do not understand why not. After all, people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16 and in Mexico the drinking age was 18 until now that it is 21. I think the reason why it is 21 is because people in the US are too retarded and do not know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or any other problems? Consider that!
240	I think more rehab centers, not just more rehabs, but better ones. In jail they will never become a productive member of society, in most rehabs they will not either. The ones that are good are too expensive for your common druggie to pay for so they quit and end up in jail.
241	The Supreme Court has ruled that race cannot be used as the primary factor in determining admissions, but can be used as part of the decision process. Diversity is the new way of life for many people.
242	It is against the law to block any road in Los Angeles County. If you block a road and an emergency person arrives, will you be moved to your back yard or otherwise? Also, it is against the law to block a sidewalk.
243	I think black people should not say either because it still is a word that divides races. If two African American kids are hanging out with a white kid and they call each other the n-word, the white kid will always feel like an outsider if he can't great them in the friendly manner they great each other.
244	This debate has made me realize that the government should not really be in the marriage business. Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all. As for plural "marriages," they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.
245	It amazes me that people can be anti-capital punishment and pro-abortion. Respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the liberal "don't kill convicted murders, but kill all the babies you want".
246	I do not believe that everyone has the right to have children.
247	You really need to stop driving, if you live in California.
248	I agree that cutting down on abortions in the US would be good. However, birth control should be administered to anyone having sex.
249	It would be similar to owning a block of land, however most or all islands are either the responsibility of a nearby country or are called protectorates of a country, so even though you own that "island block" you could not do as you wish. There is a chance you could have local laws such as a town has, but remember who is going to police them.
250	If your society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people on a racial basis then there is no difference between the two. That kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighbourhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behavior simply because there are fewer and fewer alternatives, if any, available. For example, if white Anglo-Saxon protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, then they would pretty much match the criminal profile.
251	If you take bad advice from an Internet chat/question and answer site, it is your fault. Stop trying to find ways to sue people. You are not hiring someone for legal advice on Yahoo answers. See a licensed attorney in your state if you need legal advice. If you do something extremely stupid as a result of a website, you were extremely stupid to begin with.
252	I have always been bothered by pricing based on age. For example, I hear the same old excuse that seniors are on "fixed income." What does "fixed income" mean? My income does not vary. In fact, younger people probably have more expenses than older people, with the exception of prescription drugs. And what is this "kids eat free" b.s.? Why can't I eat free? The kids aren't paying for anything. Let me eat every 5th meal free and I guarantee I will come back to your restaurant.
253	I agree that the government should be able to make more money on marijuana than it currently is.
254	If you confront this woman, she will despise you for having exposed her misdeeds. If you send the General Manager proof of her actions, he may not believe the accusations. However, you must have all your facts completely established. Getting people to write their opinion will not be accepted as fact. You need absolute proof, and to show her intent to cheat and lie. She can always claim these were innocent mistakes or things done without her knowledge.
255	I visited Dar a few weeks ago and I can give you some answers to your questions. First and foremost, I felt that there is a general feeling of detachment in the general public. There is hardly any enthusiasm in whatever they are doing and have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told. There is a great amount of tired, laid back approach to work. Things can take forever to accomplish. I am sure Turky as a country has a lot of potential, but it is a long way to go and a lot of change before that.
256	I often ask myself the same question. The sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job of terrorizing his supporters with fear. They use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on September 11, 2001, affect how we live.
257	It is not going to happen. People are free to make their own decisions in life. It is not evil or dirty. Maybe you should teach your kids about responsibility and talk to them about it. Jails are overcrowded now. Imagine what it would be like if people were thrown into jail for that. You can't stop anybody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you were younger. The more you discourage it, the more they will want to do it.
258	This situation has nothing to do with a lease. It is your business if you give the key to your apartment to someone, specifically for the reason you stated. There is no extra person staying there, it is not a sublet, and you are doing nothing wrong. It sounds like your landlord is very nosey, but you are most definately within your rights.
259	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. You are correct that only one person in the United States has been killed by a 50 caliber weapon and I believe it was a 50AE Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store make it very unpractical for any criminal.
260	It is sad that you can not trust the people who are supposed to protect you. However, if you think about it, everyone is racist in some way. Some do not even notice it. Racism is sad, but we should all look at each other the same way.
261	If you want to ask for forgiveness directly from GOD through Jesus Christ, then be a Christian not a Catholic. Catholics worship saints and idols like the Virgin Mary, while Christians worship only GOD in Jesus Christ. Those are just some of the many differences between Christians and Catholics. Please make your choice wisely. May God Bless you.
262	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists. Additionally, they are more likely to be attacked for maintaining that position, and terrorists are more likely to try to scare citizens of those countries. Therefore, the United States and the United Kingdom have been more aggressive than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
263	I do not like the idea of burning the flag, but the freedom it is supposed to represent should allow someone to do so if they choose. After all, what is being destroyed is only a piece of cloth. Making a law which prohibits us from burning the flag does much more damage than the act itself. You lose so much more by taking away people's freedom.
264	If that happens the US will pull all our funding and whatever troops are under their control. Without US support there is no UN so they can try. I would love to get rid of that organization. It has done nothing but steal, bad mouth the US and Israel, and waste our money. We haven't done anything that we shouldn't have anyway.
265	The First Amendment protects the individual's freedom to associate with whomever he chooses. For example, if two men want to free associate, they can do it as much as they like. However, the day you tell me that marrying another man is mandatory, I will leave the United States. No one will force me to marry a homosexual.
266	I think that the large supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans and other coffee beans because they do not have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their goods. And, when we are brainwashed on the money making "carbon footprint" idea, how do you justify flying food round the world just to help the poor. I do not think that the social elite will go without fair trade or organic even though it is riddled with GM due to snobbery.
267	I agree with your implication that the "Culture of Life" folks are a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites, but I am grateful that this woman was permitted to die without being at the center of a terrible storm of public controversy played out among people who don't even know her. Cold comfort, but it's all I have some days. I'm very grateful she had family with her, shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her mother.
268	I believe that the dead have a right to privacy that ought not be violated for merely prurient interest. Scholars and spies may have compelling interests in the material, but most of us do not.
269	Almost all problems seen today (and throughout history) with corruption in government are caused by the fact that we allow them to be bought with their personal desires and selfishness. If we do not allow them to have the possibility of wealth, then we can put a stop to a lot of corruption. If a rich businessman gets into politics, he should give up all money and all other non-essential things. This will prove he is not in it for the money, but for the actual job. I know chances of this being implemented are slim, but do not use that as an argument.
270	I come from a family that was involved in the Troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA were blowing up the Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to have territorial expansion into Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland has existed for more or less since WW1, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and sympathisers. I also think that IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who are acting against the UK government and are thus guilty of treason.
271	I think something like this should be done, not that it's likely under present circumstances.
272	I am a man myself and I consider myself an egalitarian, a humanitarian and a socialist. I do not like the feminist movement as from what I have personally seen from their views is that they are simply female supremacists anymore. However, from what I have seen is that MRAs are the same. I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (males being seen as all being pedophiles, women being able to get away with more socially and legally and males' lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors). However, it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about it. However, that is just my view. Please feel free to change it!
273	I believe that introducing a test to ensure voter education is important. The test would be implemented in trials where sample populations who have not yet read the bill would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.
274	I believe that the DMV should be conducting a decibel check on all car audio systems, and they should not exceed the maximum of the car's horn. I also believe that massive stereo hardware should not be considered street legal.
275	I understand that religion can be good, but there are many conflicts that have started because of religion or have revolved around religion.
276	I do not believe the world's climate is static and unchanging, I just do not think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says.
277	I was reading the post today about the supposed malaria vaccine and I thought that while it is terrific that this discovery will end the suffering of infected people and eradicate the potential to put more through that sickness, it will ultimately result in an increase in world population.
278	I have played the game and beaten it, and I do not understand why people love it so much. The game is not very good, except for the story.
279	All of these methods of killing result in long and painful deaths. Why is one acceptable but the other not?
280	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. However, to the victors go the spoils.
281	I believe that putting sex on a pedestal is harmful to society and people in relationships.
282	It is a lottery, luck of the draw. It will decide a winner, to be sure. But shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce. But it is a laziness and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.
283	I was born very early enough to completely miss the Pokemon craze. I have seen some parts of the TV shows, and they look really dumb. The games, from what I can tell, combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding.
284	I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter yet. When scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow. The jokes are not sensitive or inappropriate, but they are just jokes.
285	The right to be married is currently denied to most gay people in the world. That is a cause worth fighting for and a problem that needs rectifying. However, what exactly is there for transgendered people to fight for? It is already legal for people who want to undergo hormone treatment and surgery to change their identity as much as scientifically possible.
286	I have attended or seen pictures at family member graduation ceremonies for kindergarten, 6th grade, 8th grade, and my daughter's high school graduation. I feel that celebrating all these minor milestones in the exact same way as the final goal completely diminishes that walk across the stage for the student when they earn their diploma or degree.
287	I believe that Judaism is the most believable religion because it relies on the same proof as the national revelation.
288	I am attempting to determine the arguments for the side of the argument that I presented in a recent conversation with my girlfriend.
289	I don't like Coors light, Labatts taste like beer flavored piss-water, and Budweiser is for people who don't know what beer is. Yuengling is good, but it isn't the best beer.
290	There is no marginal utility as far as financial comfort is concerned.
291	If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have created with artificial intelligence? If not, how can God love me or you?
292	I think it depends on how the rich made their money. Some rich people came across their money honestly. They should be left alone. However, a lot of rich people have come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means. For example, hiring 'illegal alien' workers who work for about $1-2 per hour instead of hiring a legal worker who they would be required to pay minimum wage (Wal-Mart has been found guilty of this several times over the past years especially in hiring their janitorial staffs), cheating on their tax returns, pulling other accounting fiascos (just look at Enron), etc. I would say steal it all and give it to the poor because that's likely who they were taking that money from.
293	Before I began, let's create three basic ideas about God: A. God is perfect. B. God sees all. C. God can do whatever he/she wants. Now, based on those, we can come up with the following: 1. God sees evil in the world, but despite having the power to stop it (B). 2. Any being that sees wrong, knows it can be stopped by him/her, and takes no action is flawed on some level. This is contradictory to letter A, as in the scripture it is said that God is perfect. 3. Therefore, God doesn't exist.
294	Rowing is more intensive because the legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for distance or time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument of course assumes a person has cross-trained for each form of event equally. Not everyone is a natural runner of course but may have insane upper body strength, and vice versa. So it depends person to person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I would have to say rowing.
295	I believe that environmentalism is a great thing, but recently I think it could be categorized as a cult. I am tired of overpriced "green" products, carbon credits, and attempts by them to waste billions of dollars and slow down America's economy. They have gone from the point of actually focusing on real environmental issues to just feeding the public lies and creating new, pretend problems to waste our time.
296	Bill O'Reilly has an opinion and sometimes it is reasonable, but sometimes it is not. Similarly, Keith Olberman has opinions that are sometimes moderately justified and sometimes not. Nevertheless, it is permissible because the main audience is content with just winking at the sleight of hand.
297	I agree that an academic qualification ensures success in life because academic qualifications ensure you have the basics in learning. If you have strong basic knowledge of Maths, Science and Languages, you can succeed in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, to innovate and to communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
298	A recession is not always a bad thing. The US has gotten out of worse before (Late 1970's early 80's situation, and the Great Depression).
299	The present day crisis was brought on by the auto, petroleum, rubber, and construction companies after WW2. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation, and as suggested by scientists devolving solar energy, they chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building highways and freeways, malls and relying on fossil fuel while destroying the environment.
300	Perhaps not all teens; there is a good case for new drivers. Perhaps in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees (I think there are restrictions on this anyway), should have restrictions on the number of passengers. Personally, I would also suggest a restriction on how far a newly licensed driver can travel on their own, or with them as the sole driver. Obviously, this would be very hard to police, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year from new drivers on their first motorway journey.
301	Monarchies are burdens to economies if they are parliamentary monarchies because they do not have the original role of ruling. For example the British royal family cost the UK 40 million pounds a year.
302	You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know.
303	To say that nothing exists is to say that nothing exists, and paradoxically, that nothing exists. Therefore, we must apply existence to nothing, so that it becomes something.
304	I do not believe that the Phelps Clan is protected under the First Amendment. I think they crossed the line by singling out one person's funeral. It is almost an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family.
305	In 2002 Ann wrote an article that caused quite a bit of controversy. In part of the article, she said that "her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics." The article caused quite a bit of controversy. I like some of what Ann has to say, she makes sense sometimes, but it is clear that she is making fun of mentally disabled people. That is absolutely uncalled for and I think it is one of the worst things she has ever said. What do you guys think?
306	I think if the government wanted him dead, they would have offed him way before when he was actually inventing things which could possibly be related to weapons. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley would be much more likely to be a conspiracy theorist.
307	I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out.
308	The place is relaxing and has a nice terrace, but they only accept cash. The last time I was there the ATM did not work either. I do not like using my card with unknown machines. They should at least have debit or Apple Pay. I would go back for a coffee break.
309	The Cheesecake Factory is a big box food store. It is a popular place to eat, but it is also a high calorie food store.
310	The first time I came in, I ordered a latte and the girls working were friendly. The second time I came in, I grabbed a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the lady scrape her butt through her yoga pants as she walked to the back to make it. Thankfully she washed her hands before she got started but I was already over it. I did not plan on eating anything but politely waited. They certainly put a lot of time and effort into a parfait. It was a pretty fancy yogurt option after the long wait... Except for the 18inch red curly hair wrapped in the top. Health code standards have gone out the window in the valley.
311	The ambiance was good, but the food was not very good. I had the gnocchi pesto and it was not very good. The pine nuts were just sprinkled on top which seemed lazy. The salad was brown and the house Italian tasted like stale parm. I will be returning in the summer to check out the "most romantic patio in Cleveland," hoping another dish will be worth it.
312	Our waiter was fine and very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal. I was very disappointed in the food here. It was not very good. The lasagna was horrible. I don't think Chef Bernardee is better. I would not recommend this place.
313	I will admit it has been inconsistent from time to time, but I have been satisfied more often than not. The sandwiches are good, the veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions. We often use Wheel Deliver to get the Smallman Street Deli and everything is always marked properly and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches unfortunately).
314	I do not think we should wear school clothes because they are so weird. The good thing is that there is no more bullying and they are stupid and gay.
315	What is being argued about is that Windows has it pre-installed, and they are going to get rid of that as well. Everything from speed to add-ons, Firefox wins.
316	All of the innovations in E 7.0 were in Firefox.
317	I would not turn them in if my husband committed murder because I know he must have had a legitimate reason for doing so. I love him and I believe that in love we should be by your side no matter what.
318	No, I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for each other, no matter what happens. I would do anything to help her, but if she is caught, I would not go down with her. I have a family to care for and would not leave them for nothing.
319	I would not turn in my spouse if it was murder, but on the flip side, if it was murder, then I would turn it in.
320	I do not completely against TV, but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people.
321	India is full of corruption. Every person has no time to help others, and their only goal is to earn money. Our manners and civilization are fading every day.
322	India will never lead the world unless everyone can understand what they are saying due to their accent.
323	I do not think India will increase its GDP in the next five years due to unemployment. India does not even have enough funds to feed all the poor. How can we imagine them to lead the world?
324	It is really sucks not having a man to look up to while you are growing up. I believe being fatherless is better than having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you do not want to be looking up to a man who does nothing in life and it sets bad examples for you. Who knows you might grow up following his footsteps. Being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on yourself without needing a father being there. And there will always be other people by your side helping you get through life.
325	I personally know what it is like to have a poor father. My father was not very good. I have not heard from him since I was thirteen. It does not bother me because I do not know him, and because he is not around, I am never set up for any disappointment.
326	I would rather be raised by a loving and caring mother than have a lousy father.
327	He restored the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people. Farquhar, however, wanted to gain control through his actions.
328	Porn is wrong because you are being lustful. It's even more wrong when you are married because you are looking at another person in a preverted way that is not your wife or husband, which is cheating on them. But all of us have been lustful before, right?
329	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary theory. True. However, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We cannot say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory. However, the evolution theory is interesting and quite possible, but it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, it is the best possible theory.
330	I was wondering if there was a reason for everything. I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. How does an animal acquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? And you proved my point. "Species have certain characteristics and properties." I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change. I'm curious, what insects are you talking about?
331	IE has been there since then and is already installed on a typical computer. However, Firefox still needs to be downloaded or installed.
332	I think that it should be compulsory for PE classes in schools, because it offers children a bit of exercise. Additionally, some health classes should be included so that children know how to have a basic diet so that they will not become obese in the future.
333	Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in the hospital. Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times. Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having a great time with your girlfriends.
334	Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and brought traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
335	He invited immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and set up an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.
336	Raffles did not care about the citizens, did not spare a thought at all. So what if he discovered the island Mahulah Singaporepura, he did not help in the least in Singapore's development. Why in the world should he deserve the title of Singapore's founder? Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
337	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder.
338	Farquar handled many problems, such as the rat and centipede infestation in just a few days. Raffles did not do anything about the problem at all.
339	There is a simple counter to the argument that "what if the baby was to be the next DaVinci?". What if the person who is pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was not prepared for.
340	Life has been around for billions of years, so why have scientists been unable to replicate it in a laboratory? Because they have not spent that same billions of years trying.
341	If you can, please explain what you are saying.
342	I do not understand why it matters so much. We are here. Whoop-de-doo. So go on and live your life! If you want to believe in creationism, that's great, good for you. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I do not understand why even debating it is necessary. Yet, with all that said, maybe it was a little hypocritical of me to post this.
343	I have to disagree with Phoebus and say that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur. When different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
344	I used to believe that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the argument that an all-knowing, all-powerful, loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
345	I find it interesting that there are currently seven votes for "Porn is wrong", but no one is willing or able to explain why.
346	Making a profit on sex is not wrong, it's genius.
347	Pornography is not wrong because in schools that never give an accurate demonstration because of parents. Pornography teaches not only teaches but also gives prime examples.
348	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I would rather help others in any way I can. Even a small thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with their needs to survive life.
349	I think that school uniforms are a good idea. First of all, it makes students look nice and tidy. Second, we can find out who is studying in which school and who is in the same school as us. And third, it's convenient because we don't have to spend too much time choosing clothes for school.
350	I would rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things that could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father for anything.
351	I think it is better to have a bad Father than to be Fatherless. Maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the thought that you did not have one or doubting how it could have been.
352	I think it is better to have a lousy father than a fatherless because you can count on your father. No matter what happens, your father will always be there for you. If you do not have a father, you do not really know what is right or wrong.
353	I would have to say that having a lousy father is better than not having a father at all because there will be a point where you need his help. You may not be able to help but you tried.
354	I feel that it is better to have a lousy father than not have one at all. If someone is bad at something, it means that there is always a possibility that one day they will be good at it. Therefore, being fatherless is not even a possibility of having a good father.
355	Estimates place worldwide bottled water sales at between $50 and $100 billion per year, with the market expanding at a rate of 7 percent. However, bottled water is a dry well.
356	TV is educational because it brings you live news and information that you cannot find in books.
357	You can get the Foxtel Go app for your iPad so you can watch TV wherever and whenever you want.
358	You can just sit on the couch with a snack, a burger, or candy and watch television when you can't do anything else.
359	Water bottles are a safe source of water and are a guarantee of safety.
360	Many government programs distribute bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Additionally, contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.
361	It is true that bottled water is a waste, but bottles can be reused.
362	If bottled water did not exist, more people would be drinking sweet liquids because it was the only portable drink. People would become fat!
363	It is obvious that marriage is not for everyone. It is for people to reproduce and make new life.
364	I wish the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.
365	Guys and girls were made for a reason. It is not so they can pair up with the same sex. It is so that they can pair up with the opposite gender. Opposites Attract, everywhere.
366	I don't support it. If there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It bothers me that people who claim to be Christians support it and allow homosexual clergy.
367	It is unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite gender.
368	Of course it has the potential, but right now the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent this. I can't think of a leading nation that has had large scale internal conflict, it just doesn't work.
369	India and China could redefine what a third world country means. In the future, both countries will be first and third world countries simultaneously.
370	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Christianity is different because it is not one belief that everyone shares. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.
371	I have a problem with Christianity. Why is it about belief? There have been horrible people who are believers, but what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists? Is it fair to punish them for not knowing what reality is? I am an atheist and I am a good person.
372	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are Christian or atheism. Shouldn't it be "theism or atheism or other"?
373	Sometimes kids need to behave like that.
374	I agree, they must understand what they were wrong, and after that, they will receive consequences, and from that, they will learn not to do it again.
375	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, while a religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith should not be.
376	Parents should not use spanking as an option to discipline their children. It only makes the child angry rather than letting them know what they have done wrong.
377	No, because hitting your child can mentally scar them for life. Additionally, it can make them believe that hitting their children is okay.
378	I would tell them whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense, they would most likely get away with it, but if it was an act of rage, I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat me alive and I would not want to live knowing that there is a family mourning because of my spouse's actions.
379	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder, whether it was by accident or on purpose. If it was an accident, then the police will figure that out.
380	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I would rather they kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason, I probably would turn him in. Love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
381	The government does tell women what they can and cannot do with their bodies. For example, it is illegal to commit suicide. If a person is caught trying to hack themselves to peices, they could be placed in a mental facility.
382	Women have become selfish in their bodies, believing that they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the child because they feel like it and have made a mistake. These are children's lives we are talking about.
383	We are dealing with indirect murder when a woman decides to abort a child she has just had, which may have been a big contribution to society.
384	While phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools, they should not be mandatory. Perhaps, in lower grades, it would be better to have an optional class instead of a continuous mandatory class.
385	It is expensive and embarrassing for some students. It is unfair to students who are not in varsity sports because varsity athletes can waive the class.
386	It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs, so who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that heterosexual couples enjoy?
387	I am an avid supporter of gay rights. Marriage is said to be the union of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of having children. Is that right in any case?
388	You can help others for the common good, but you must first have personal pursuits.
389	You have a rather limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society. In addition, you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which do not exist.
390	It sounds like you have big trouble. CASA, Community Alternate Systems Agency, is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If you took your child to a doctor or an Emergency Room and someone saw what they took for signs of abuse, they are bound by law to make a report. If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade.
391	The official reason is that they make an 'orderly market'. Therefore, they must buy and sell to keep the market from sudden and dramatic shifts. Therefore, they are forced to buy and sell under certain conditions.
392	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you, while your new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict would be if the two of you had the same lawyer. Obviously that cannot work. You need someone who can look out for your interests and she needs someone who can look out for hers. As long as you did not cheat on your ex-wife with your new girlfriend, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
393	The reason the media has given little attention to the Plamegate scandal is because the corporations that control the media are major Republican donors.
394	I agree that a woman should have the right to choose and there are many children out there who have to go through foster homes and live very hard lives.
395	Ethically, it is not okay for anyone to spy on innocent people. It is foolish and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities. However, we have the right to know what the government is doing because it is with our money. Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us. The 4th Amendment has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to cooperate with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we have left.
396	I am not so sure about the specifics of any Yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances may have tailed off over recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore it because we are more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
397	If you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then I say you should sue for compensation. Money won't change the awful things that have been through to you. If you can get something out of the crap you have been through other than anger and bitterness, then why not. I hope that everything works out for you and your family. You deserve it.
398	Probably not. Not many people work for free unless there is a compelling social reason to do so. For example, if you are protesting discrimination, etc., you might get someone to take the case on fee. However, this will only work if you have a good case and a high potential settlement amount. Otherwise, prepare to pay. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) to get my training.
399	I do not want to turn this into a bash-Bush answer, but one thing I have noticed is his inability to be an effective public speaker. You would think he has the best speech writers money could buy, right? Problem is, I do not think he uses them. I almost think he just wings the whole damn thing, but who knows. I do not see a problem with speech writers. If you really want to hear how a person speaks, debates are a good place to start, since even though they have official "answers" to expected questions, they do have to be on their toes a bit more than when they give an address.
400	First of all, the Constitution does not guarantee the "pursuit (or persuit) of happiness". That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. Secondly, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law? I mean, take laws relating to age of consent. Why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds? In other words, how do you draw a line?
401	The difference between the two is that one is legal and the other is not. The difference is that it is not legal to have sex with someone for free, but it is totally legal to have sex with someone for money. The difference is that it is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have sex with someone for free.

402	The justice system developed and practiced in the United States is the best that has developed in mankind in all of history so far. It is flawed, but it is human. It is still the best we have come up with so far.
403	You might be able to. Here's what I would do. Gather all your receipts. If you do not have the actual receipts, you may be sucked and might as well stop here. However, there is the possibility that the old pharmacy has your prescriptions on file and they may be able to provide you with a print out of your purchases. I do not think the pharmacy will be willing to reimburse you, but the insurance company might. Copy all the receipts, write a letter and fill out your insurance company claim form. Send it all in and cross your fingers. Good luck!
404	You should not expect to get a realistic answer from anyone here because no one here knows all the details of your case. It would take an attorney a large amount of time to prepare a defense for you, and nobody here is going to be able to offer you real help without knowing all the details. YES!A is not going to be very helpful to you in this situation.
405	I am not being sarcastic, because I have been warned that three strikes equals life. I would not like to be a part of the "just a little pot" type of crime, but it is not true that they committed other crimes that did not get caught. We, Californians, are safer without them on the streets.
406	Yes, if it is his baby. They are married and although they may be separated, they are still legally bound. The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in. Why assume the man left? She did not say that in her question. She only said they were separated. Maybe the mother is the one who left!
407	You signed a contract knowing you were not going to abide by it? The answer is yes. They, the property management, CAN place restrictions in the lease. Depending upon how the lease reads exactly, the key to this restriction is the word "loaded". Meaning you can keep an unloaded gun with a clip or speed loader nearby. It will be hard to prove either way.
408	Unfortunately, you cannot reopen such a case without new evidence. The best you can do is pursue your lawyer, but it probably won't help much. However, a valuable lesson is to be learned here- you were so young when it happened, your body had many changes to go through, and with Firestone's record, you should have had a clause in the settlement (or not settled at all) so that future consequences of the accident could be claimed.
409	If you do it in good faith, it is fine. However, if you do it in order to yell "I have a bomb!" in public places and then justify it by saying you were speaking in your new language and it was your sole purpose in coming up with a new language in the FIRST place, then it will not help you. You will be convicted of "making terroristic threats."
410	I think it should be thrown out immediately as inadmissible evidence.
411	Well, since she signed for it, legally she can be held responsible for it. There is no way to get her name off the loan. The only way that she can try to get it off is by disputing the signature on the promissory note, otherwise she is stuck. And no, he won't get off scott free either. They can take his tax return to pay on it. She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.
412	I guess the feminists are still following Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer minority babies.
413	They do not do that. It is Hollywood. I have been to court many times to observe, not as a witness, and I have never seen them do that. They only ask you to raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar.
414	Are you certain that you are accurately reporting the information the attorney gave you? If your vehicle is parked on the private property of your employer, the laws of your state may very well give them the right to enforce this policy. Regardless of your feelings about the policy, chances are that you are an "at will" employee unless you belong to a union. I am not aware of any state or federal law that would protect you if your employer fired you for violating the policy. So you have two choices: (1) stop smoking, or (2) go off the property to smoke.
415	It is still considered a violation of the law. The driver with the legal "right-of-way" is the one with the green light, regardless of his or her mental state.
416	Doctor, be very careful with this. I'm a writer and an ex police officer. These people will have you surgically removing their boots from your own. Send an official certified letter to the original publisher of the material along with a permission form to use their content. And, if they don't get back to you, extract the information from another source. Protect yourself my friend. Their lawyers will eat your lunch and not leave you a Twinkie! Also, a disclaimer on your site is still a good idea.
417	It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many. Conservatism and pro-life are not the same things.
418	I am completely in favor of this. People are arguing that it is barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that a pervert who has raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live. We would put down a dangerous dog, why not do the same to some of the scum that lives in our country. The justice system in Britain at the moment is hopeless. Far too many people are getting away with all sorts and something needs to be done!
419	You admitted fault here and I bet that you admitted fault there too.
420	I try to teach my children to "treat others as you want them to treat you, not the way that they treat you". Two negatives only make a positive in math. Torture is completely unacceptable. Those who think that is acceptable are completely wrong and will change their minds once they have been tortured.
421	I am a law-abiding citizen, and I have a license to carry a gun to protect myself and my home.
422	Emergency psychiatric evaluations are not an arrest, nor are they available for review by an employer. The American Disabilities Act prevents this, and gives you grounds for a law suit if it is used against you. You need to make your employer aware of your condition, and if he fires you, you will file a claim with the American Disabilities Association. Chances are they will deny your claim if you did not make them aware of your condition prior to employment. After the ADA reviews this, you will be given a "right to sue" letter. You will then be given a "right to sue" letter. You will then be given a "right to sue" letter. You will then be able to get a lawyer involved, and he will argue that you did not make your employer aware of your condition prior to employment because they would not have hired you in the first place. Many lawyers work pro bono and have a field day with employers like these.
423	I am not sure what you meant by "your question is hard to read for those of us that actually speak and write in English." I am referring to the third marriage of which I am currently in the midst of. It is foolish to act like a virgin this early in my life. I know others that are in their fifth marriage; you think they should wait as well. I am sorry, but you are not alone in your lack of prudence.
424	I think it is usually acceptable to break the law if someone would suffer bodily harm or death without breaking it. Additionally, if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court.
425	I would never have admitted this publicly, hence the post, but I enjoyed Battlefield Earth. The acting is poor, but it is a decent Sci-Fi movie, with a good amount of action. I liked the thought of post-war America, with shout outs to Fort Hood, Knox, and a couple other famous cities. The learning machine allows the humans to become intelligent, Travolta getting his comeuppance at the end. I tend to watch it when it is on. To give a prime example, my five favorite movies of all time, in no particular order, are: Shawshank, Godfather, Inside Man, Animal House, and Goodfellas.
426	I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because it was "pornographic" when the text is not sexy or titilating. Some don't even include real descriptions of sex at all.
427	I do not care which party wins, I do not care which party they belong to. I feel that there will be a 25% chance of some major scandal, and there will definitely be corruption. This is because every incumbent cancels out what their predecessors put in place to put their own mark on things.
428	Instruments have such wild limitations compared to normal composition programs that I think they are obsolete in the modern musical world. They have imperfection, and you can't control the frequencies of the sounds you're making. It's like being a soldier vs. being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.
429	I have been stuck with this debate for months now, and I cannot think of a right moral path. I have always thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food and not fun, is morally right because there animals don't understand death, like humans do. They will have the same wonderful life in the wild, even if I kill them. As for producing animals, in order for food, I also think this is okay as long as the animals are treated right and fair. That's why I am a vegan right now, because I hate how the main meat sources we have come from are horrible people who treat animals with unneeded cruelty, or at least it seems like they do.
430	I have little emotional connection to the college I am finishing. The college is not prestigious or well known for the area I am studying, therefore the coursework was not as vigorous as could be and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies little dedication towards studying and finishing my course work is frankly embarrassing.
431	After a marriage ends, if a pre-nup was not signed, then one partner usually receives alimony from the other. I think this is wrong and selfish of the people who receive it. If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid.
432	I have heard references to how good other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. I have listened to a lot of bands such as Mudhoney, Green River, Sonic Youth and others and I have to admit I never heard anything close to a "Lithium" or a "Smells like teen spirit." However, there were other great bands that are in the same league as Pearl Jam and to a lesser extent Alice in Chains and Soundgarden.
433	I scroll through Reddit and there seem to be long sections in the comments I can't understand. People are talking about Spaghetti and Transformers movies. I am sick of it.
434	As an academic definition it makes sense, some people benefit from characteristics they are born with based on historical and present discrimination, but it seems like wherever it's used outside sociological theory it instead is an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with. For example, "You're privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid." I feel that using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem, rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I do not think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong.
435	The IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife is hypocritical.
436	The realism in games such as Call of Duty and Battlefield is similar to the cop and soldier training simulators designed to teach people knee jerk methods on shooting others. Observing depictions of human death and suffering has become the past time for millions of kids around the world. It is illogical to think that the mind is not being trained to be more violent through media.
437	I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world nation is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hides a problem. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in said country, their livelihood will be ruined by rice which is freely available to the population. If any kind of donation is made, it should be money.
438	I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts. If you're smart, you can be a wheelchair bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world.
439	I believe that no one should be allowed to be a permanent member and that the 5 countries with the largest influence on the world (defined through a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records) will lose their seat. As for the rest of the seats they would be filled as they currently are. As for veto power I believe that it is overpowered, for proof of this look towards North Korea. I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to get action on an issue. I understand that this is 2 part, but they go together so I thought it should be ok to put them in 1 CMV.
440	I do not view suicide as a choice, it is a fight or flight response. Some people cope better than others, but I do not. My philosophy on the value of life is that it is not about the quality of life, but about the pain and suffering that accompany it.
441	I do not want to come across as speaking ill of the dead, but I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention. Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has and here is why: She ruined both of her marriages because she slept with other (married) men. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. None of these things make her a bad person, but she should not be considered a role model to women. Any woman that exhibits this kind of behavior today would be considered to be an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone? She was not classy, she was not elegant. At best, she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day.
442	I have grown up in rural Ireland and have been raised to despise Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80's while on hunger strike she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after despite massive public outcry. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her.
443	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago and almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVE the movie. The reason I don't hate the movie is because the acting was not very good and the soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to top 10 movie of the year.
444	I am against HFCS because it kills people. While I understand it is cheaper, it is not better. Examples: 1.) Any type of artificial sugar can cause obesity or even cancer. 2.) Factories that produce HFCS are very unregulated by the FDA. Tests have proven that there are contaminants of mercury in some batches of HFCS. 3.) HFCS and cane sugar are not biochemically identical, and our bodies do not process them the same way. 4.) The corn industry is very corrupt and has been causing local farmers to go out of business, having a detrimental effect on the US economy. I believe that HFCS should not be used by major companies such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
445	This happens all the time online and in real life. Someone says something and another person says "that's racist," which is their trump card that they feel immediately discredits the other person's argument. I disagree.
446	The quality of the anime is not as good as that of the manga.
447	Although eBay serves only as a market medium for connecting suppliers with consumers, it is better from an economic perspective. With no firmly set prices, eBay's market closely resembles an internet-based free market where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. In other words, this is a self-targeting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency. Amazon on the other hand used to use consumer price-targeting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targetting. Now they are setting prices based on what the product suppliers are setting them at, they may not be working at optimum efficiency.
448	I believe Final Fantasy is better than Kingdom Hearts because it has better graphics and a better story line.
449	Arguments about the existence of God are useless. There have been logical arguments presented, but they can be disproven using more logic. There is no concrete argument that can be presented to prove or disprove his existence, thus making it useless to debate about his existence or not. It all comes down to faith.
450	The least that Bush can do is pledge that the 'Last World Superpower' will cut down on its contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day.
451	The most important point against torture is that it does not work. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy right out of "24." That just does not happen in the real world. Another point against it is that we should not be held accountable for our actions when we degrade ourselves by stooping to the level of our enemies.
452	If you find out you are pregnant, look for an adoptive parent, and if that fails, then you can have an abortion.
453	The poor need help. The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer unless we intervene. Having poor people exploited is bad for society.
454	I watched the original debate in the House of Lords on TV, and I wonder if it would have been better if the steps had been taken to secure a binding resolution, with all seven nations on board.
455	It is not wise to bank our future on fossil fuels, but until we get more efficient electric and other technologies it seems like a great stepping point.
456	I believe that rugby is superior because it is a combination of the two most basic forms of athleticism, running and wrestling. They run constantly, coupled with constant attack and defense, with no time-outs and no dead plays.
457	This is a no brainer, coffee has no medical benefits. However, marijuana has been used for many health benefits for thousands of years.
458	Absolutely not. Why am I obliged to provide for my neighbor? You are in effect forcing individuals to make contributions to charities without their consent. Establish voluntary support associations, with reasonable criteria for the support applicants (e.g. they are in the process of trying to get a job/education), and then I am interested. Give tax breaks to those who contribute (this already happens when you contribute to a recognized charity). Provide insurance benefits only to those who've contributed in the past. Even require applicants to pay back the dole they've received, if you wish. But don't tell me what a worthy cause is. That's my decision.
459	College athletes do get paid. Going to college costs money, if they are good enough and maintain a GPA they receive scholarships which are essentially debt relief. There is no difference between cashing a check for $1000 and using it to pay a credit card and a scholarship for $1000. The question here then, is whether or not college athletes get paid, but should college sports be for profit? If it is a state school the answer is automatically no.
460	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. By starting fires in civilian areas, the group fits the definition of terrorist.
461	The money given to private institutions like these is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity. You do not know what they are going to do with it and how it will benefit their students.
462	I do not understand how cutting someone's hair would straighten them out. For most kids, it would not really teach them a valuable lesson. If you can properly discipline your child, then there is no reason to cut their hair as a punishment. If it does come to punishing them, there are better ways for them to learn what they did wrong.
463	If the police are not allowed to protect the population from criminal gangs, regular citizens will take up arms to protect themselves. This is not good for the rule of law.
464	I was very disappointed with this place. I have been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always leave full and happy. I came here after hearing all the hype about pho and was not happy. I would definitely pick ramen over pho any day. The egg rolls were very good though.
465	This place is a little ghetto. There were only about 25 people at the restaurant at the time. I noticed a girl nodding off at a table, which does not seem like it is caused by alcohol. The server was alright. They were out of three types of tacos as well as sour cream, which was strange for a Friday night. We had a good time, but I doubt we will be returning for the next girls night.
466	My family has always ordered from 109 for over 10 years. Our house number ends 4949 and I call from my cell phone. Recently, the employees are very disrespectful when they can't hear what I'm saying. The employees who answered at 4:59pm today rudely hung up on me. It is the fourth time that the employees are very disrespectful and mean. We decided to go with Papa John's because at least their employees are professionals and friendly.
467	I was disappointed in the service. The server took our drinks and dinner orders at the same time. It was a Saturday night and the staffing was not sufficient.
468	I love this place. It's the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time. It's family owned and they are all very personable with their customers. They take the time to spark conversation with you while your order is being prepared. My favorite dishes are the Carne Asada Fries with Angus beef or Chicken Chimichangas. You can't go wrong with this place. I always forget to go in and take advantage of it. I don't mind paying even if it's the day after.
469	I was very disappointed in the service and the bartender. She was rude, short and immature. We asked for chips and salsa and she said they only had nachos. We ordered quesadilla and she brought sour cream and salsa and she said it was not on the menu. I suggested that next time she should go into the kitchen and ask them to throw chips in a bowl and salsa in a bowl and bring it out. She told me I was being confrontational and she rolled her eyes. We will never go back there again.
470	Our friend had the Mac & Cheese and she said it was really good. She even got some wings to go because her man loves them. The outdoor seating was super chill, although that day they allowed some kids to come in and they were definitely obnoxious.
471	A school should not attempt to hinder the creative expression of its still developing children.
472	It does not show kids' expressions and uniforms do not show it.
473	I want to mention about wearing school uniform by high school students. It really makes no sense, it's the opposite. It just makes troubles within students and teachers relations. People aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become a serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers.
474	Wearing uniform does not mean better learning at school. Students go to school to learn to prepare for their future, not to waste money on uniform.
475	Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across are on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time. This is a known issue, which a simple restart will fix. Additionally, arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... weakness. For every feature they added to IE7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars, customizable buttons, who needs em!)
476	There is no reason to believe that IE is better, as Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and more customizable than IE. Additionally, you can customize it to look any way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. Additionally, it even has a more original name.
477	I doubt that if that were to happen, but I would definitely support her and be with her no matter what!
478	If my spouse committed murder, I would not turn him in. Instead, I would help him hide all evidence, and I would move if we had to. I would never bring it up to him again. If my husband murdered someone, he knew what he was doing, so it was not for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn him in.
479	Have you noticed that those who are against books have terrible arguments? For example, the person who said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because TV rots the brain.
480	India does not have the potential to "rule" the world, because have you seen the people? Good Indian people with good minds are in foreign countries getting Nobel prizes, while the others are just stuck ups who do nothing and push the people who come up, down. Nobody actually lets anyone succeed.
481	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that knowing your father is there is enough, but to me, having a father who does nothing is an absence. He knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather he never exist than come in and out of my life.
482	This argument could go either way, but I would have to agree that a lousy father is a father who is never there when you need him to be there or he is never there to listen to what you have to say. That's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be.
483	I think both being fatherless and having a lousy father is depressing. However, I would prefer to be fatherless because at least you know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if I had a lousy father and did not care about me. In this case, I am in the middle of these two choices.
484	When Raffles returned after a period of time, he changed rules and concepts Farquhar had set to suit the needs of the people. This can show that he cares for the people.
485	Although Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas, and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Therefore, it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas.
486	The founder of Singapore is not a person who "discovers" a place. For example, I can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of Singapore. I do know that Farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work. However, let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore, so he was given credit.
487	Pornography is wrong, but it is done in moderation. People addicted to pornography expect all women to look and act like porn stars when in reality that is not what sex is about.
488	I become suicidal thinking about the one I love most. I have had sexual intercourse with other women.
489	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. For example, in the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for rock strata. However, radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s, and the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it certainly does not sound like true scientific rigor to me.
490	It doesn't matter how you believe in the Big Bang, but it must have been created by someone.
491	What I meant was that both moths were present at the time of the observation, both colored moths were on the trees, and the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution. Does this just happen by good fortune?
492	In the 21st century, we have come to a point where the only way for us to evolve is to start to create. This is evolution, but with more responsibility placed on mankind.
493	Could a higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when in fact it is only 150,000 years old?
494	Spam and Adware seem to be more compatible with Internet Explorer.
495	I believe that Physical Education should be mandatory for people to exercise. If they do not get exercise, they will not burn as much fats as they accumulate, thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical Education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around.
496	Physics education must be taught but it must not be compulsory because some people are not fit to do the extensive exercises.
497	This will help kids learn leadership and discipline. It could also lead to reducing childhood obesity.
498	Definattley all those obese kids need exercise and it is a wonderful part of life, of course it should be mandatory.
499	I agree with her that children should learn how to live a healthy lifestyle. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so that fewer people in our country are obese.
500	Yes, our children are out of shape and eat too much junk food.
501	Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea but the implementation was left to Farquhar.
502	I believe that both Adam and Eve were created by God. Adam and Eve were not really human, but rather single celled. Man had a hard time believing that so we created the first creatures.
503	I apologize, I do not believe in God.
504	"The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins is a good read.
505	I am not an addict, but I watch pornography once or twice a day when I am on my own and with a great boyfriend, we have sex once or twice a week. We use porn to spice things up in the bedroom, but we know it is all fantasy. We are not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
506	I do not mind if my boyfriend watches porn. I think it is natural for people to have sexual desires. If people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just do not watch it. However, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I do not see a problem with that.
507	If we all just helped ourselves, where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point.
508	While striving to make advancements for the common good, many people have succeeded in doing so.
509	Simply Written Seeking to advance the Common good allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey (or) series of considerate acts one can have an less-difficult time Pursuing a "Personal" goal or lifestyle. The word for this debate is "sacrifice." How much would a person really "sacrifice" for his or her neighbor without being blinded by the light of selfishness?? No matter where a person is in their life... Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
510	Preparing people for what they may have to wear in their later life is important, so that no unsuitable clothing is worn.
511	I try to see things in both directions, but I think having a bad father would be better for me, because in order to grow up and be ready for life, you have to learn about life, and if you do not have an image or person to look up to, life could be harder or not good.
512	It is better to have a lousy father than not have one at all.
513	I would not live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I would not care if my father was not working or having a bad life. Having a father is important, especially if your father is a friend. You can talk to him about your problems as a man and they will understand. You cannot live with your mother because she is a woman and her views are different than a man.
514	Well with our water bottle consumption on earth, we could cover all of Mexico three times. That would be a lot of "rich" in their minds Mexicans.
515	Using Pepsi's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani as examples, both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents per ounce. Compared to municipal water, which costs less than 1 cent per gallon, why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink?
516	TV is better because you can explore the world while sitting on a couch.
517	I learned English through TV. Although I learned English through interaction with native speakers, TV helped me a lot more than books.
518	Television has made children enthusiastic and confident, which makes them better in their studies.
519	Bottled water consumption has increased dramatically over the past ten to fifteen years. This growth has taken place globally, but particularly in Europe and North America.
520	All other beverages consume huge amounts of water and energy during their production processes, which has a far greater ecological impact than that of bottled water.
521	Gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.
522	To say India cannot lead the world is to say that a newborn child cannot walk. I agree that there are so many problems that India is facing today but we are improving day by day.
523	I am a new girl joining the forums who are in favor of dis argue and those who are in opposition of dis topic. Please, I would like you to think before you tell about India's potential because the wealth which the foreigners are enjoying is the looted one for India. The other foreign countries are more developed than us because it is the Indian people who are using their brain and making the foreign countries develop.
524	Yes, India has the potential to lead the world. Therefore, many countries depend on scientists and most employees in every country are Indian.
525	Religious people always say, "You can't prove he doesn't exist!". They mean, you cannot disprove a negative. Meaning, you can't prove something is not there, which is already not there.
526	God is not real, so you need to get over it. You dumb believers of God.
527	I believe spanking should be an option. However, I believe it should be the last option.
528	I believe that spanking your child shows them that what they did was wrong, and if they do not want to feel like they did wrong again, they will not make the same mistake again.
529	I believe that I have a personal relationship with Christ.
530	I cannot imagine life without belief in God. Actually, I can, it would be hell.
531	This is wrong. We should not insult who we believe in. We do not need to know what your people think.
532	This is the most ridiculous debate I have ever seen. Please explain to me how we got so perfect where the earth, sun, and moon are in the right spot and our bodies function perfectly. We were made after His own image.
533	People should not hit their children because the child will think it is okay to hit someone else back. For example, at school, they will end up fighting and abusive to others.
534	No, because they do not always need to be spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.
535	Is personhood absolute or is it predicated upon position? If a premature baby is lying in an incubator or, for the sake of argument, a 5 gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because the child is inside the womb?
536	I choose life because keeping the law pro-choice allows women to murder their own unborn human child.
537	No, physical education has been around for more than 200 years. Today, PE is barely having any effect because kids are filling themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
538	Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.
539	I have muscle cramps all the time when I am doing intense exercises like doing a long run.
540	Physical Education causes many problems. Furthermore, we should not need Phys Ed to graduate from high school.
541	In my opinion, homosexual marriage is not a good idea. It is not a big difference in society, but it is your choice.
542	I think it all depends on the individual's point of view. We have no right to go against it.
543	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This does not always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for yourself, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better, but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful. We only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be.
544	It is important to help others, but there is a time when it is not necessary. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfilment where one is truly happy.
545	I think that focusing on a personal pursuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I do not think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that you are going to advance the common good, but you can help people around you, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but ultimately, if you are ever in the position of power and have money, you could truly advance the common good.
546	No one goes to court honestly, relies on empty pleas, speaks lies, and creates mischief. Hence, justice is far from us.
547	You are wrong. I apologize. You have a court order that requires you to appear in court to answer a motion to collect a debt. If it is on court paper and has a case number, call the court to confirm the docket number and find out when the hearing date is. Yes, they do have that power. Yes, that is the equivalent of a subpoena. If you "just let it ride", as you say, do not be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it Gone! What you should do is: Seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you. Do not hesitate - you will regret it.
548	We do not have time, but it is your civic duty to participate in court. There are specific criteria that will relieve you of jury duty, but you still need to appear in court and allow the judge to review your petition/request and dismiss you legally. As far as trying to act like a shithole in the courtroom and prejudice your responses, be careful-you can be held in contempt of court and perjury is very expensive.
549	There has been a movement in this country for more religious power and power of the church. Do some research and check out how wealthy the Catholic Church is. It will shock you. There is no way they are going to be like China not 'obeying' their (not God's) rules.
550	Australia does not have a basic human rights under the constitution. We do not have a Bill of Rights like in the United States. Any rights we do have are established by the courts. The question may be whether he has bashed the baby as well, or is likely to do so, but I am not a lawyer so I cannot be certain.
551	If the DA wins, your case may be lost, but if the DA loses, you will be in a better position to sue the witness who you believe lied. You can sue in civil court, and you might be able to sue in Small Claims without a lawyer.
552	Bush assumes it will put the US at risk of losing the edge in industrial production. The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in America. To adhere to the standards America needs to upgrade a large number of industries. Another reason is these agreements will be fully implemented in the US but the other third world countries do not have the financial power or expertise to implement it.
553	The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, is very clear that if one uses another person's computer service without permission, he has committed an offense. I am unsure of the Act's legislative history, but the law was around since 1993.
554	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but it was done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. What is the difference?
555	If you were supportive when he was in the police academy, then maybe you should be happy that he was improving himself and furthering his career. If that was the only issue that caused your break-up, then yes, you should get back together with him.
556	It depends on your state. Here in Nebraska the legal majority age is 19. Most states it is 18. However, there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that support is necessary through high school. It is a very difficult thing to deal with. If your daughter is still living with her father you should be giving him money towards her support. If she is "on her own" in her own apartment, you have no obligation to pay an 18 year olds rent. I would tell her she is on her own. If she wants to come home and finish high school she can. But if she wants to be a Junkie she is on her own. She can move into the Dope mans house, get a job, or join the army. All you can do is keep a light on and pray...but you do not have to pay.
557	The United States does not want to steal Iraq's oil. It needs to control the world trade in oil. Basially require all oil-producing countries to market their oil in dollars, effectively making American paper money redeemable in oil. Compliant Arab regimes also re-invest hundreds of billions of dollars of oil profits in the United States. If they are allowed to start selling oil in Euros they will invest their profits somewhere else and the US economy will suffer tremendously. That is why Bush went to war with all these countries to maintain America's control over the oil trade.
558	I do not think that it should be a government choice. It should be the owner of the property choice. I have yet to be somewhere where smoke bothers me because most places are non smoking. Bars here in Ohio are not most anyway. That does not bother me at all. I prefer my money to go to my child's college fund, but if this passes I will not have a choice will I?
559	If you are with your children, you should supervise them at all times. Also, 90% to 95% of sex offenses occur when someone is close to the child in family or friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and the registries do nothing but provide a false sense of security.
560	In the state of Georgia, as of 2006, a child of 17 years of age cannot move out of parents home without permission unless another guardian is appointed or you are an adult. Contact your local juvenile office if in doubt. The only reason the law enforcement does not enforce this law is because it would cost millions of dollars to enforce and most police officers are not up to date on juvenile laws. Another few months will not hurt if you are truly in love and you can finish school to make a brighter future for the two of you. Then maybe Mother will be more for the relationship. Good Luck!!!! I have already been there!!!!
561	I do not know Louisiana law, but I have never heard of a state putting something like that into law. Instead, it is common courtesy that employers and employees typically offer two weeks notice before terminating. If you want to maintain a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference from them later, it is advisable to give two weeks notice, but I would be shocked to hear that it is required.
562	You seem to be looking for something to be discriminated against. If you miss your payments, they have the right to discontinue their services to you. It sounds as though they gave you at least a couple of breaks, but you chose not to do what is right, that is, pay your bills on time. I am proud of my Native American heritage and I do not feel discriminated against because I pay my bills on time if not early.
563	The sheriff's department does not have sales, they are not in the business of being creditors, liquidators, repossesors, salesmen. They are bluffing you (harrasement), they are laws on this. When a deby get dues to expire collection agencies get real aggressive on collection.
564	No one objectes when those who commit crimes are extradited. However, we all know that accusations are made against innocent people, and not all legal systems are the same in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them who face trial elsewhere are going to want to be convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.
565	Some of the laws we have now actually may not have been stupid when they were passed. For example, a law forbidding having meat during periods when cows were seriously ill, and there was no other means to warn people about the dangers of eating that meat. But it is foolish to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful.
566	The nazis were not acting out of hate, like Stalin, but they were doing what they deemed right.
567	I do not care what anyone else thinks, a child needs a mother and a father, not two women and two men.
568	The vast majority of the answers above make the same mistake that the question implies. It is not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reasoning cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justification) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. As long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion. It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.
569	I think it is a good idea. Everyone at school is on the same playing field, at least in terms of appearance. This way, students who are less fortunate and do not have much money to buy clothes or have a lot of clothes do not have to worry about what they are going to wear. This helps their self-esteem and allows them to concentrate more on schoolwork.
570	No, any society that values the value of human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.
571	If you are speaking of having the government interfere with what parents and responsible adults do to teach our children, then no.
572	I have always thought that I am Irish and I do not complain about Notre Dame's nickname, "Fighting Irish." I do not go around saying my heritage is being mocked or that I am offended because "people think I like fighting." It is ridiculous. There is so much more to worry about than school mascot names.
573	I believe the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information. Newspapers are in the business of basing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort.
574	You do not need a piece of paper from anyone to prove that you are married and want a lifetime commitment from the person you love the most. Just tell her she is your wife and hold a ceremony somewhere the both of you find attractive and share your thoughts on the future and express your love for one another. And do not forget to continue this thinking every day for the rest of your life.
575	Your client? Please, I am not a crack pot conspiracy theorist. First, there is no consistent question within your rant of improperly formed English (incomplete sentences). Second, the racism charges in your "question" make it highly suspect. I am glad that your "client" is not allowed in the United States.
576	The laws governing the above vary greatly from state to state. For the most accurate information, consult an attorney who is licensed in your state.
577	I am not going to complain about the regular sex. Shower time could get right out of hand. It is a drag. Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you do not necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke. There are many good looking loonies in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy, so it is worth going for it. So each has it's pros and cons, but I would recommend psychiatric ward over jail. And jail over my last marriage.
578	There are literally tens of thousands of water companies in the United States. If they comply with those regulations, there is no basis for a suit, class action or otherwise. However, in order to prevail, you would have to prove negligence. If you do not like tap water, you should drill your own well, install your own filtration system or buy bottled water. However, you will not prevail if you attempt to sue a water company unless you prove they are negligent.
579	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but in the long run, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it. Similarly, the same tactic has also been used against private citizens; activists would wait near big public events where ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with paint or something looking like blood.
580	The alternative would be Hamurarbbi's Sheria/Law, where justice is meted out in the form of chopping off body parts.
581	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker? Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this sounds like it goes a little far. Unless your boyfriend has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he is not going to be liked or respected. That's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man, is he really an illegal allien? Then INS could come in and send him back.
582	I get angry when I hear someone say this, but I feel that 90% of the time, laziness is to blame.
583	I've slowly been losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd. There's this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it. Because you can't easily leap from something existing to something moral without something being taken as axiomatic. I can't seem to find any reason to believe that I should make that jump. *Why* should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explainable without it? *Why* should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning next to one without the latter, it seems far simpler with less baggage. CMV please.
584	The government should pay for education.
585	I used to watch that show with my family, but it has become a cheap sex joke and I am embarrassed to watch it anymore.
586	I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that should not be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women.
587	I agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs. Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months. I am not questioning the importance of journalism, but it is my position in the news chain. Why read the paper or watch the news when I can find out what is important from trusted people and then read myself, rather than sift through headlines.
588	I have heard the usual reasoning and still find no logic in it. They are providing us with a service that does not have to be provided for us. They work hard and they usually only get paid enough to cover the state and federal taxes applied to the wages. Not tipping our servers is like a slap in the face to them. They rate their performance on how big or small their tips are. Be brutal, kind, or whatever you want. Just be logical.
589	I do not see any benefits in government recognition of marriages. First, the benefits are that marriage is not a fight about what marriage is. If you want to get married by your church, you still can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony, you can. Government does not care. Instant equality. Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No messy divorces. Instant efficiency.
590	People always talk about how unfair it is to discriminate against people, but I see a lot of discrimination and hatred against the rich on reddit. I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination.
591	I see the headlines "Isreal bombs Gaza; WONT STOP DESPITE KILLING CIVILIANS." I think it is possible that the Palestinians are taking up military strongholds in public compounds such as schools and hospitals, taking hostages, and minimizing their military casualties by allowing the Israelis to destroy these compounds while under the impression that there are more soldiers there. The end result is propaganda against a UN affiliated nation that is "mercilessly committing genocide against a smaller, helpless nation" despite all of the tension between these two nations that led up to this.
592	The best size for a political unit is the city, big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy).
593	There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913. People with moustaches haven't been seen as trustworthy since then.
594	I am only 23 years old and this subject angers me greatly. I chose the age of 30 because I believe the age gap between 30 and 17 is too big. I feel like this should be only done for sexual crimes because I don't think anybody could possibly get turned on by murder. I believe castration would be a suitable punishment because you wouldn't really be able to rape a minor without a penis.
595	If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an understanding of what wrong and right actually are? We should teach morals not religion. Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong, so why tell a man acting on horniness is wrong? I am not saying rape is right, just that consential sex with a girlfriend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a'sin' is causing rape.
596	I have been looking into this economic doctrine for a while, and I don't understand how in 2014 you can still defend these principles as being ethical or particularly effective.
597	I already thought it was very likely in the near term and even long term that George W Bush would go down as the worst president in history, but now that we are seeing Iraq unravel, I am sure of it.
598	The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda to keep kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings and is a key reason why there are more school shootings. When you put an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force. That is what the school system and laws in place do.
599	I believe that football in America is called football despite being an egg shaped thing because it is associated with the sport of that country, while soccer is the foreign sport. Why is this different?
600	I am now in a long-distance relationship where there is a pressure to move to where my significant other is living and working. We are both in inflexible corporate jobs. I believe I cannot sacrifice my career anymore for a big move. I do not speak the language he speaks (although I am learning it, I speak it in an elementary level). CMV. What beliefs do you hold that can make me move to be with someone I love but which will make me throw away everything in my home country? What other things should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?
601	Powermat is being installed in 100,000 locations around the United States. If the next iPhone has a built in PMA component, then Qi will lose the war. Apple users are often Starbucks and Teavana regulars, so it will be convenient for them.
602	I think that if the teams were both forced to spread across the entire field, it would allow for much more passing, shooting, and generally exciting offensives. This would also make the game much more exciting and more pleasing for the fans.
603	I was a firm believer in the whole UFO topic for several years. However, after extensively following pretty much every new UFO sighting or alien conspiracy I could find, I gradually went from being a firm believer to feeling that all alien/ UFO accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony. Similarly, so many credible sources of eyewitness testimony end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money and or simply lying about their expertise. I would love for it to be true that aliens have been visiting earth and its all a big coverup, but I can't think of a single credible example that hasn't been thoroughly discredited.
604	In my opinion, it serves to remind men to fulfill traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It is the male equivalent of "be more ladylike".
605	The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, is the least morally defensible concept I can imagine. The scale of this concept is immense, with billions of people being permanently tortured or tortured for their convictions. Nothing all of humanity combined can ever come close to the scale of this.
606	I'm a fan of Daisy. I know, I know, her voice is irritating, but that's your opinion. However, Super Mario Land was the first Mario game I ever beat, and so I have an affinity for her. Beyond that, it just makes sense to use her at least once. She's a familiar face to anyone who's ever played Mario Kart since the Gamecube. Moreover, now that Nintendo has a habit of sending Mario to places outside of the Mushroom Kingdom, a la Galaxy or 3D World, it would make perfect sense to bring him back to Sarassaland. It would let Peach be a playable character, it would make the Mario universe more cohesive. Please, change your mind, because it is never going to happen and I do not want to die sad.
607	I have spent a lot of time thinking about what qualities a "perfect" money would have, as I see many flaws with the current "candidates" e.g. gold, dollars, euros, etc. I believe market forces will push more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior monies in the market place) until Bitcoin consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency. I have invested my life's savings in Bitcoin. Would you change your mind?
608	I believe that Bill Nye is a much more prominent figure among the younger generation and has the skills and knowledge required to create a truly amazing experience while watching the Cosmos series.
609	I am studying at university and get good grades. However, it has become an expectation that I achieve Firsts, and therefore when I do score highly on work I receive replies such as "of course" or "is that it?" jokingly from my peers. I feel that this puts pressure on me to keep up with the competition, but I am lacking that experience.
610	I have watched a marathon of the series and I believe the first three were more enjoyable than the last three.
611	I believe that metal is evil because it contains evil symbolism.
612	We must all agree that George W. Bush is one of the worst people in America and we must find someone more competent with the politics and world affairs of the United States of America that will bring us into this time of need for leadership, albeit only for two years.
613	I have no idea why he wants to do this, but he is taking a risk with the UN membership fee.
614	People will always keep their opinions about religion, no matter what. Because they were raised that way.
615	What practical application is there in knowing whether or not there was life on Mars? What practical benefit could we gain from knowing whether or not there was life on Mars?
616	I made a bet with my friend if the world does not end in 2012, I get $5 if it does, he gets $5. I am looking forward to that.
617	I do believe that physical punishment is more effective than verbal scolding. This method of disciplining has been part of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child.
618	My friend is being foolish. She is gonna move to Texas to a place where 13% of the entire town is white, mostly gang territory, not far from the Mexican border, and leaving everything behind, including family and friends. What do you think?
619	He was smarter than Sheldon because he had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10. He skipped from grade 4 to grade 10 and did not have any trouble doing the work and also taught the grade 10 class. He was able to hack into numerous things. He was even on a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with grown adults that were very smart, perhaps as smart as Sheldon.
620	I prefer calendars that start with Sunday because it is prettier, but the week starts on Monday.
621	I had a terrible experience and will never return.
622	I cannot believe I did not write a review for this place. It is located inside the Planet Hollywood and is open 24/7. It is a great place to go to when you have the munchies while your food is ready.
623	This buffet has a great idea of individual portions. The service was great and the food was really good. I will definitely come back to try for dinner.
624	Raising Cane's is a great choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. Additionally, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw as a bonus.
625	I live a hop, skip and a jump away from this gem and checked it out for the first time after some Arsenal workers recommended it. The owner is super friendly, makes everything from scratch and gives you substantial portions at an extremely low price. The place is never too crowded so he is always able to whip up your delicious meal in no time while you gaze at the busy strip of Penn Avenue outside.
626	We went there twice and the first time was decent but the steaks were way overcooked. We decided we would give them another try and order our steaks rare. The second time was a 20 min wait to be seated and another 15 for the food. When we got it, the steaks were way overcooked again, even though we ordered it rare. The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery, and my son did not touch it again. We then went up front to pay and it took another 7 mins for someone to come ring us up. We told her how awful it was and she said "sorry, $34.24" We should have just walked out. I would not have felt guilty, it was disgusting.
627	The pizza was alright. It cost $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay, they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. You have to hit no for the tip and sign. I would think that for take out orders, they would not ask for a tip at all.
628	Students should be allowed to express themselves, and with their uniforms, they are all alike, which is boring.
629	I think that they are bad because you should be free without anyone telling you what to do.
630	The school my mother works at, and the school district my cousin's three children attend, use school uniforms. The reason is to reduce bullying, which in reality, does not address the problem. The only good thing it does is that students aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate what they wear. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
631	Students have the right way to feel and express themselves, but it is wrong; it is the learning that makes us smart.
632	When you are out of college or high school, or in an office, you have to choose your own clothing.
633	I find that whatever works for one person is good. For me, Firefox is the best because it works multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The configuration isn't too bad, and those of you who know about configuration know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and have many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definitely superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update.
634	The second paragraph of your argument is not worth rebutting, as it contains no more than a single fact and is not even an argument either.
635	I would not turn my wife in because I love her and we married for a reason. However, I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, because murder is still murder.
636	I would definitely stick by my vows of marriage, but some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. That is a hard one. I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in times of need, until death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time, for whatever reason, I do not know this is a tough one.
637	Books are better than television because TV can make you blind and your eyes can hurt a lot if you watch too much.
638	Books are better than TV because most of the TV kids watch influences them which is not good. Most parents do not care what their children watch because they watch books because you learn more from books.
639	I am a student in class eleven and I have to participate in a dance competition. Please give me more information and I will be very obliged to you.
640	The increasing population means less land, and less land means a big crowd on every place. India is able to win gold medals for corrosion, terrorism, illeteracy, violence, etc.
641	I don't think I would want a father who did nothing for me in the future, because chances are you will not see each other five years from now. Why try to make it work when you already know what the outcome will be?
642	It can be either way, but being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerves and make you do things you do not want to do. But that is the way fathers are. You still have other people to look up to even though your father is not around.
643	I think it is better if you are a lousy father than a lousy father because your lousy father would give you bad influence. Perhaps you will follow your father as he is, but if you are a fatherless it will be okay but not good either because you might not like being a fatherless.
644	I would support the fact that being fatherless is similar to having a lousy father.
645	As a young boy you grow hoping that your father will be there when you need him. The last thing you need is someone who lives with you and does not do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life.
646	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it would be orderly, elegant, rational and modern. However, while he was gone, Farquhar developed Singapore poorly, causing Raffles to feel disappointed.
647	Although Farquhar was said to be the one who stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, the strategizing, and was the one to select Singapore as another British base, giving early British support of the British. If William Farquhar was to be proclaimed the founder because he did the "grunt work", should the supervisor of a construction site get the most commission, instead of the contractor? And besides, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors and he did not leave of free will.
648	William Farquhar was the one who remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen. He was also the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's development, so he should be considered a founder.
649	Schooling Raffles established the Singapore Institution, which was completed in 1837.
650	Raffles conceived a town plan to redesign Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and land for government buildings.
651	Raffles found that Farquhar had done a poor job of raising the city of Singapore. He also introduced opium sales to Singapore in order to raise more money to build Singapore.
652	If you lived in that olden time conditions for just one month, it would be a surprise if you did not catch a disease every single day. Hospitals were one thing that raffles built and that would have saved many people in those times because the living conditions there were bad. Another reason he has helped in the development.
653	Is it wrong, unhealthy, or addictive? It does not mean it should not exist.
654	If a man and a woman are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sex gratification other than their spouse. In a relationship, they should not need any other forms of gratification other than their spouse.
655	We will all find out within the next 100 years whether or not God created the universe.
656	I am familiar with the classic peppered moth argument. However, I am not sure how that proves the evolutionary process. Both moth colors have always been there, it is just a matter of which is easier for their prey to see.
657	Evolution is as likely as a tornado coming through a junkyard and putting together a 747 Airplane.
658	I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues. First, it takes a long time to load from the disk. Compared to Opera, which takes much less time to start, FFX takes tens of seconds to load. Second, plug-ins I frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player do not work well in FFX. Finally, Firefox is still young, but it is much better than IE.
659	Emotions aside, Firefox does not have ActiveX support, so it is unusable for the new Windows Virtual Earth tool.
660	Chorme is better than all of them. It is faster, safer, and open-source, like Firefox.
661	Although Raffles did all the planning, Farquhar did make some plans of his own as well.
662	Farquhar was the one who played the role of a'mother' to Singapore. He contributed more to Singapore than Raffles, which supports the fact that he was the founder of Singapore.
663	I am going to take the Obama approach to this issue. Abortion is never something a woman would take lightly. There will always be a lot of thinking, asking for help, and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people do not seem to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing. We pro-choice hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering decision.
664	If a woman is raped and left with the child of the man who raped her, she should have the right to give up that child.
665	I am against abortion, but I believe in the right of choice. What matters to a pregnant mother is that she decides what to do with her child.
666	In the United States of America, abortion is the only constitutional option. Whereas, elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
667	How could that be? What religion were you raised in? Did you attend church or Sunday school? Pray before meals? Pray at school? Pray at night? I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer and God. It didn't make sense so I stopped assuming God was real and stopped saying the Prayer. Thankfully, my public school system stopped that practice.
668	There is no concrete evidence that supports the existence of a god. Religion and the bible have so many contradictions and changes that I have become less and less convinced in the existence of a god. Evolution, on the other hand, makes more sense to me. Animals adapt to their environment and will evolve to be able to survive through different climates and situations over huge amounts of time.
669	I believe that the common good is a better endeavor, because it is better to give than to receive. It is better to give your hand out in help than to hold your own hand.
670	Both endeavors are better to be part of, but I as an individual would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other, to do things way better than they used to. Everyone in this world knows what they want to be, to be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some others will help the community to make it safe and better. To teach them what they are capable of, to believe in themselves that they can do the things that wealthy people do.
671	I do not like hurting people, so advancing the common good is better for me. If I were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that would end up hurting someone else.
672	Student victimization is likely to be decreased, fights and gang activity should be decreased.
673	Yes, school uniform is important. It reminds us that we are part of the school. It also reminds us that we are part of the school. If we do not use our uniform, the teacher will punish us. This way we can learn to be disciplined. If we go out of the school, the teacher will see that we have used our uniform.
674	If you were to grow up without a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. If your father is lousy, it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like my brother and I, my father is lousy but I am still happy that I know who he is.
675	I think it's better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because growing up without a father can be hard for some kids.
676	I think it's better to have a bad father than not have a father. A father just being in the child's life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way.
677	Bottled water is not regulated as is tap water, so you have no idea what you are drinking.
678	I do not think that water bottles should be allowed anywhere unless it is an emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles are not recycled and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. The water is usually tap water, which is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.
679	Over 1.5 million barrels of oil were used to make plastic bottles consumed in the US last year, and that is not including the petroleum used to transport them. That is enough petroleum to power 100,000 automobiles for a year.
680	In New York City alone, the transportation of bottled water from western Europe released an estimated 3,800 tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere. Additionally, 18 million gallons of bottled water were shipped in from Fiji in 2006.
681	If you do not save bottled water for an emergency, you are thinking about now rather than later. You are drinking bottled water when you do not even need to.
682	Nowadays, no one can live without television. It is common to watch television to all people. TV is better than books.
683	Television is important for communication.
684	It is a source of entertainment and it helps people who can't read.
685	As long as people recycle the environment, water bottles are thrown away and polluted. It is not the water companies fault.
686	The issue of marriage should be left to the Church and not Congress. Perhaps, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it does not break the separation between church and state ruled by the Supreme Court.
687	Gay people are making a terrible mistake. I think they are living their life right now without having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.
688	Do we have the potential? Yes, the only competition we have is China who has done a much better job in the long run. But as India runs, it always brings order out of chaos.
689	Why do you think we cannot stand that question? You also forgot all the other choices. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism, one and so on.
690	Christianity believes in rape, genocide, hell fire, unscientific claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc. Atheism rejects these claims based on logic, observation, and common sense.
691	I support Christianity because I believe in God and your proof that God does not exist does not change the case or change the other way.
692	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was fortunate to encounter a church full of people who were kind and committed to their beliefs. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still fully believes in the beliefs and teachings of the Christians, but now I see it differently. I believe in God, not religion.
693	I am a Christian because I believe that there is a just God who will bring justice for all good and bad deeds that have been done here on earth.
694	I am not a Christian, but if you are a Christian, you really cannot argue with them unless your argument is based on the same subject. Similar to Street fighting and UFC, but on a different platform.
695	If God does not exist, why are there so many predictions made thousands of years before Jesus was born?
696	It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirement. How would you consider PE if the child is not well? And if you can separate boys and girls, for boys, you can give them some good games of PE. The same thing can be done for girls, giving them games for their ideas.
697	It is not like marriage is some holy thing, we sell it on TV, in drive-throughs, etc., and that is fake love. If people really want to be together, then who are you to tell them no? If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend. And what will you do when your kids are gay?
698	Three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups, especially against gay marriage. They are extremely biased. I did not even have to go to the sites to know that.
699	Gay marriage bans, and other laws are in place because of the religious right that seems to be infringing this country.
700	There is an argument about whether gay marriage is acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most people in Britain would say it is wrong. However, I think anybody should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love. I think it is acceptable because how come we can get married to the other sexuality. A man can't express his feelings to a woman or a man and a woman as gay sexuality. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like!
701	I think that personal pursuit is better because I think that helping yourself first is natural. I think that everything comes back to you even if you are helping others because you do not want your life to be out of balance while helping others.
702	I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they are blood.
703	You do not say anything about your homelife. You have to have a very good reason for it. If you could get a job with a job in walking distance, I think they consider that reasonable. I put up with a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home, and I still recommend staying at home as long as you can. If it is your homelife that is the problem, you should contact social services.
704	He knew about it, did not petition the court at that time, and let a lot of time go by, the court will view this as allowing it. However, he will have to petition the court to find her in contempt, and order her to return to the state. A lot better chance had it done prior to her moving, or as soon as she moved.
705	The deal is "Freedom of speech goes both ways." People not only have a right to say pretty much what they want, but other people have a right to object, argue, and even ask for an apology.
706	Americans as a whole do not think this way. There is much controversy in our country about this issue. It is currently legal in most (I believe) states to have an abortion, but conservative religious zealots are always trying to change the law. I am pro-woman's rights, but not pro-abortion and not pro-life, but believe that since it is the woman's responsibility it ultimately needs to be her choice.
707	Capital punishment is the best law enforcement available. Ask any country that has employed it and you'll find that their crime rates are much lower than the USA's. However, it is immoral and a violation of human rights. Capital punishment should not be the first choice.
708	The dismissal of the lawsuit leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt. "Without prjeudice", means that the case was not adjudicated and no resolution has been reached. However, at this point you have grounds for a counter-action if they continue to pursue this claim or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies. You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected. Additionally, you should notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change. In this manner, you protect your interests - and, if the company is foolish enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
709	To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared capital punishment to abortion, the fact is, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent.
710	I believe that you should put a fence around any pool in Ohio. If you do not put a fence around your pool, and a child sneaks in and drowns, you will be completely liable, and you would likely lose your house, your car, and your wages would be garnished for years while you worked to pay off the liability lawsuit. In my opinion, the risk isn't worth the reward, so I would install it no matter what the law is.
711	I recently learned about discrimination in the workplace and covered this topic. However, white men are the only group that is not covered in a protected class. It is illegal to exclude them, but how often do they need protection in America?
712	You should change your bank account number immediately so they cannot access it any more. This is the only reliable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you have given your permission for the withdrawal. Then set up other payment arrangements. While you are doing this, you should tell them you are reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you. Write that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left. Then stop paying. If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
713	I would not vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and waste of the American taxpayers' money.
714	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those who are passing it will often react based on emotion and grief rather than reason.
715	I will fight to the death to ensure that others are free to express their opinions.
716	Iraq does not deserve freedom like ours. We need to keep fighting the terrorist for the people of the world from the terrorist who rule it. We are not dictators, we are freedom fighters who fight for freedom, justice, and liberty. Unfortunately, people lost sight of it and voted wrong yesterday. We are headed in the wrong direction.
717	Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder or hurt other people's rights. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught. However, people tend to bend and break laws that have no severe penalty.
718	I agree with you that fireworks are dangerous and should not be sold in shops.
719	I think the Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined. They are talking of keeping prisoners in Cuba for the rest of their lives without charges or benefit of legal defense. The only way to protect our rights is to participate in the process of government.
720	If half the schools in the US think yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now these kids need to know their rights and the rights of others. I thought schools get taught the Constitution and Bill of Rights. At least I would expect the Civil War to be mentioned before 6th grade. Freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion, and so on. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not new great Brittan or some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. (ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. No wonder why 1/2 the youth is lost and confused).
721	If we are speaking of ethics, you should be notified of any medications taken by the child. Legally, if this juvenile center is treating your child for any sort of mental illness, they do not have to notify you if he or she is older than 12. Additionally, I believe that since the child is a ward of the state due to his or her incarceration, the state does not have to notify you of any new charges or pending charges...
722	I have never been a server or waitress, but I feel that regardless of how much tips they make, they should be paid minimum wage. They work just as hard as anyone else, and as for the tips, they have to earn them.
723	I agree that if a person wishes to say the Pledge before a meeting, class, etc., they should be allowed to do so. However, it is perfectly within their rights to abstain.
724	Firstly, because this essentially puts a price on human life and dignity. Life can be given, it should not be sold.
725	I don't think so. It's a given that you are taking a test to show what you have learned. Obviously, he hasn't learned anything. It would be like getting surgery on your heart and after the doctor says, "oh you wanted it done correctly? Well, you didn't say that". Tell him to take the energy he is scheming with to study.
726	If your daughter was 19 years old and competent at the time, all records are hers. If years have passed since your daughter hasn't made previous attempts to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders. You need a lawyer involved.
727	There are many people who are unable to accept this, for many reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of their own citizens.
728	The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process. The person asking the question has his bias; the person who wrote the question has his bias; and the person who answered the question has a bias as well. The former two forms of bias should ideally not show up in the results of an ethically conducted poll, however they often do. The second most important shortcoming is that small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both. Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll. In short, polls will never be 100% helpful until they are designed, executed, and administered with practically no human intervention whatsoever. But what's the fun in that?
729	When my time on earth is over, to the extent that people remember you fondly and are changed for having known you, you have made a difference.
730	Yes, it's biased. But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet subject search records of Americans over to Bush and Co. in the guise of cracking down on porn? From what I've heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda. And it was dumb to pose that question. It is a crime to threaten the President and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way--especially by this president. But I've noticed that they have let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then are fine with it. I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
731	Have you been standing out in the free cheese line in the hot sun for too long?
732	I do not blame Bush for asking for this power; I blame a cowardly Congress for granting it.
733	In most states, employment is at-will, meaning an employer can dismiss an employee for any reason or no reason at all. However, there are restrictions. Employees cannot be fired because they are a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability). They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whistleblowers in most states. Seek legal advice.
734	I heard that in Australia and the US there is a much higher rate of identity theft because all someone needs to steal your identity is one card instead of having to go through a lot of bills and other information to get all your details. I think this is a bad idea and you will probably end up having to have an ID card to prove who you are in order to get an ID card. You will need a passport, driving licence or some other thing that not everybody has. Then again if they introduced them and someone stole the identity of someone like the prime minister and got all his money then they would just see how silly an idea it was.
735	I like the way you started, "All Rise!" and there is no legal system which is perfect. Moreover, I do not trust "god" and this is due to the fact that God never talks to anyone except the leaders. This gives me suspicions that the leaders claim they were told by God! - what do you think? For example, whenever someone attacks another, in the last 16 centuries, they claim that God ordered them to do that! Last but not without importance was the Bush claim for America's and her allies to Iraq!
736	I do not like any form of Marxism. I believe a man should be judged by who he is not. I believe that public education is a waste of money due to the low literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. Hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. We will always have wars because man is basically selfish.
737	I agree with you, unless maybe the person can't for a medical reason, etc., but other than that, yes. Show respect for our country! Our brave soldiers are willing to go fight for America and risk their lives. Some people in here are too lazy to get of their ass to pledge allegiance to the flag. I think it is wrong. I will proudly stand for my country and do everything I can to support it.
738	He still has the right to a court appointed attorney, but if you cannot make bail or obtain a bondsman, he will have to tough it until his court date. If he hates it that bad, he will not make the same mistake again when choosing a girl.
739	I do not discriminate against homosexuals, but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that homosexuals are not a choice.
740	Although mergers of big companies are carefully analyzed before getting a green light, so as not to distort competition by creating a single company with too much power, the purchase of smaller companies by big companies is not considered problematic, even if the value of the small company is huge.
741	I live near a large naval base and everyone in the community worships the military. I understand that what they are doing is brave, but it is viewed as more noble in my community to join the military after high school than to go to college. On the other hand, anyone who has the opinion that war is wrong and that a large military is bad is viewed down upon in my community.
742	I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine and a.40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun that holds 12 rounds. My opinion is that someone can take out just as many people with a hand gun as they would with an "assault rifle". However, handguns would be more dangerous because they are easier to conceal.
743	I did not feel anything when the cat passed on the road. It was feral and had no owners. It is not about arguing whether road killing is bad or good for the environment. It is about my own emotional reaction to seeing a cat die senselessly.
744	Paper checks were a practical, easy way to transfer money from a checking account to another account. However, with today's technology (debit cards), the need for them has disappeared. Direct deposit is paperless, so it is no longer necessary for employers to use paper checks for employee payments.
745	Men have been hit hardest by the recession, and have not bounced back well. Moreover, many men remain unemployed, and go to college at lower numbers than ever. Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not. There exist lots of secure jobs (teaching and nursing are the most readily available and accessible examples) that are 90% female, both in the field and in college majors. Considering the higher male unemployment, I think anyone offering a male-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male-specific scholarship to a male-dominated field. Please CMV.
746	I do not think that Nascar is a sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it is about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I do not know how anybody can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How entertaining is that? I would rather watch a cricket game.
747	In both of these events, a country lost territory which rightfully belonged to its people. In both cases, an authority felt the need to land-grab, one secured their military base, the other wanted their holy land back. This naturally leads to deaths. Yet, because of the superpowers involved it's common to make this an issue about taking sides with either the US or Russia, when the countries essentially did the same thing.
748	I do not like the death penalty in general because I do not think it works as a deterrent; people who commit foolish crimes are not foresightful enough to be thinking about the consequences. However, corporate leaders probably are. They will think twice before sinking the airship and bailing out with a golden parachute, because they will land on Lady Liberty's sword.
749	There are hundreds of states on the planet and all of them engage extensively in initiating aggression against the individuals they control. Sometimes the violence is in response to violence initiated by individuals and then it can be justified. For example, imprisoning a murderer. A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates the violence. Yet most people do not see the aggression initiated by the state as problematic. For example, a shop robbery is wrong. However, taxation is justified on the basis of a "social contract" or other vague concept. We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example we say "drafted" when we could say "slave soldier" or "drug confiscation" when we could say "theft of herbs." These euphemisms muddy the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations.
750	I believe that government is a good thing, the consciousness of society when done right, and taxes are the natural cost of having a good government. However, high taxes do not necessarily mean a good government. I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails. Why is a good government a government that governs least, and thus needs less money? Who ever heard of a structure that does its purpose best by doing it least? I do not understand. Please help me understand.
751	It is quite simple. Men who are wealthy and famous have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They do not need any game to have sex. It is too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. It is more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you. For this reason, I believe that women such as Tiger Woods ex-wife were being delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.
752	Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices they are not the ones to cut your head off.
753	I believe the word they might be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture that is not just reserved for blacks. There are many parts of this culture that are bad for society.
754	Christian A does not deserve to be taken seriously, they can still have their beliefs without denying what's scientifically proven, but they choose to be ignorant.
755	I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbation. I felt a sense of dread and depression knowing I would just masturbate again some later date. Today I broke my 4 day streak and I feel depressed and stressed.
756	We are all capable of the horrible acts that Hitler committed or encouraged. The right circumstances and societal influences could bring out the same in each of us.
757	Many of the things that we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner. I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self.
758	One cannot decide whether one sex is greater in intelligence than the other. It will all depend upon the individual.
759	However, creature comforts and political freedom are still attractive features to non-Americans. As a result, we gain valuable brainpower from countries like India and China every day.
760	I do not have a conflict between believing in God and evolution, as many progressive Christians do.
761	Oil has long outlived its use. There is enough plastic in existence that simply recycling what is unused could supply more plastic. Battery technology has existed for nearly 10 years now that can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge. That is more than many gas-run vehicles on the road today.
762	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free.
763	I do not think such a thing should be enforced by law. In certain cases privacy on the internet is necessary. However, if you have nothing to hide or are not reconnoitering shit, then you do not need to hide your identity.
764	As of now pride has much more talent than ufc. It has fighters from all over the world, whereas ufc is limited to north america. This is not a US vs. world argument, it just means there's a bigger talent pool to pick for pride.
765	I listen to rock and roll music, not to think about life's deeper meanings. When I listen to rock music, my standard of greatness is whether or not the song makes me want to turn up the volume. I cannot think of a single Beatles song that I can simply turn on and rock out to. The Who, hands down.
766	Human beings are not able to live without the help of machines. This is seen in the hospital, where respirators, kidney dialysis machines, and defibrillator devices are used to keep people alive when they are on the brink of death. Furthermore, hand phones, cars, mp3 players, and the notorious PSP that we see thousands of children, teens, and adults playing clearly show mankind's huge dependence on machines.
767	I don't know how I would want to earn my living, but what right do I have to judge what someone else does with their life? I have trouble keeping track of myself. When I was younger, I might have answered this question differently. Life changes as you mature. I am only responsible for myself and I will have to answer for what I have or haven't done. Anybody that doesn't think I am right probably has a few more life experiences before them.
768	I would argue that people are basically good. That is not to say that all people are good all the time, or even that all people are basically good.
769	Let us assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis in case he should become the big cheese after the November election. However, keep in mind that he has admitted that the economy is not his strong suit, so I let him slide on that too. What stops him from giving up just a few hours for one evening to be part of a debate that is very important to his election chances? Because of that, I feel McCain is running scared which is hurting his chances.
770	The answer is no, but there are several times "no" is the correct answer though; dictatorships have called themselves a republic. In both forms, the people vote for the person/persons they want to "rule" them, the people choose those who agree with them.
771	Why go out of your way to take away some people's rights?
772	Although it is not technically correct (web 2.0 is not a new technical iteration of the WWW), mass adoption of a technology requires two important things: 1) A technology that works and 2) A hook that the audience and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will be able to relate to, mass marketers can use it, etc.
773	I play guitar and I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. I love Guitar Hero! It actually helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed. Can people try and spell a little better at least with the titles of the debates? I mean, come on, they let you know when you've misspelled a word. Although the whoever created this one spelled the word correctly, they just typed the completely wrong word.
774	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobicity: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level. Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
775	Victor Frankl was a psychiatrist and during World War II a prisoner in a concentration camp. He said that in such a terrible condition he felt free because he could choose to go insane or keep the calm. Not only did he feel free, he was free because freedom is choice and the capacity to do whatever one wants. Every choice has a consequence. I can choose if tomorrow I steal a bank and I am going to jail (if they catch me XD) and if you choose a path you should accept the consequences.
776	I think that GRAW on the 360 is the best military multi player game on the system. The graphics are superb and obviously more realistic than GOW. The gameplay is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing field to novices alongside more experienced players.
777	I ordered a grilled veggie burrito with lots of hot sauce. The hot sauce did not help, and the fillings were very bland. It was definitely cheaper than the other burrito places, but I would rather pay more for a good burrito.
778	My wife and I love this place. However, they have changed the nachos from a deliciously tasty chip to ones that are not as good. We will not be ordering out guac, salsa, and chips anymore. Why bother?
779	My husband, who is stingy with his stars, has had his fair share of NY deli meats. I was a bit nervous about bringing him here since their smoked meat is simply the best. He tried it and loved it. So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out. Do not let the long lines ruin your experience!
780	I was not impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain. I had been looking for a place to stop in Madison while on a business trip and found this place. I had planned to do some work in the tea shop but it was very warm in the space and didn't seem like a place I could get anything done. The tapioca pearls were fantastic and clearly fresh, but the mango fruit tea was just too sweet. The tea was much better when I was able to add ice to it.
781	The burgers were good but the price was high.
782	K O'Donnells is the place to be. They have everything you need for a stellar meal. They have an award winning dog patio where you can socialize with other dogs. If you are looking for a stellar Happy Hour, come in from 3-7 and get some food and ice cold beers. You can't go wrong with the daily specials and those specialty martinis!
783	I am a frequent customer at this chipotle. It is nice and close to my house. It is located near the Happy Valley round about which can get super busy when everyone is getting off work so we like to go early or a little later to avoid the rush. It's also busy so the line gets lunch especially at lunch time but is typically pretty fast. Good food and great customer service. The manager Thomas is awesome and so friendly. He recognizes my fiancé and I as frequent customers and always greets us.
784	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy. The food was average. We will try another buffet next time we are in Vegas.
785	Your own clothes are cool, and if you get to wear what you want it is cool.
786	The new Firefox browser has a lot of features that make it faster than the old browsers.
787	I use Linux and there is no IE version for Linux. You can do anything with that and no one will process you about it.
788	Who said anything about FF/Mozilla having anything to do with Steve Jobs/apple? It is not related at all. IE is terrible when making pages and trying to get things to look right. FF sticks to world wide web consortium standards much closer than IE ever did or will.
789	If my wife confided in me, I would not betrayed her trust. She trusted me to support and help her, and I would. I would be extremely angry and possibly even divorce her, depending on the type of murder.
790	India will not lead the world because the gap between rich and poor is too great and they still heavily believe in the caste system.
791	This is not logical. We all started together and that is the way it should end. Everyone has their own way.
792	syona, if you look at it from a distance, most of us are unable to specify any solid solutions by which we can remove the hurdle in our progress from the root. We are all very much aware of problems but unable to give solutions. They are criticizing government, terrorists, corrupt politicians, and so on. No one realizes that being a citizen what is our duty? Everyone should understand about their importance and role for country. Because a good citizen, a criminal, terrorist, corrupt politician, and so on. Everyone is human, then why a human is creating problems for another human. I hope you will think my views and reply to me soon.
793	I would rather be without a father than have a poor father. I would want a good role model to look up to and talk to, rather than someone who is never present.
794	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that knowing your father is there is enough, but to me, having a father who does nothing is an absence. He knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather he never exist than come in and out of my life.
795	We say Obama is the "founder" of health reform because he was in such a high position and he could do something like invest money, time, and effort in such a project.
796	Some would say that Raffles left Singapore for a few years and left Farquer incharge. This is not the truth. Imagine SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have done so much for us and are considered the founders of us. Are you trying to imply that now they are back taking care of their own schools? Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time would you say he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting Singapore? He has a life!
797	I am downloading porn as I type this. I do not think it is right to watch pornography unless it features attractive lesbians.
798	Pornography is wrong. If people watch it, they will want to have free sex. Free sex will cause a disease, especially HIV. In morality, it is wrong.
799	It depends on your beliefs, because I am a Christian, I believe it is true, but to someone else who is not a Christian, it may not be completely okay.
800	It should not be about how we got here, it is about why we are here.
801	If the elimination is real, find me someone half way through.
802	Nobrob was not invented before Firefox.
803	Personally, I believe Google Chrome is the worst, but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
804	Most government sites in India are designed for Internet Explorer, so it is important to have IE installed on your computer.
805	Physical Education teaches kids that it does not matter if they are a nerd or a jock, because if they are all in the same class doing the same thing then they only pass that class if they put forth effort. And from personal experience sometimes there is a jock underneath the nerd outside.
806	The answer is quite simple: teachers should let everyone exercise so they can strengthen their mussels and get thinner and more flexible instead of fatter and more lazy so they will not get bullied as much.
807	Physical education should be mandatory because 112,000 people have died in the year 2011 due to lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese.
808	I think that PE classes should be mandatory in school to help with obesity.
809	Because today a lot of students are playing computer games after school has finished. This can cause students to not get good health and also cause serious diseases like cancer because of electromagnetic waves.
810	Real PE lessons provide opportunities for people to realize what they are capable of doing, thus enhancing their self-esteem and allowing them to be productive in their society.
811	I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.
812	I believe that no one should be able to abuse the right to have abortion.
813	It is the woman's choice and you cannot control her. For example, how do you know she would not kill herself in an attempt to kill her child as well?
814	If a woman cannot support a child emotionally, physically or financially, she should have the right to choose to give up that child.
815	It depends on the situation. If a female is raped, it is not fair that she has to keep the child. On the other hand, if a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up having a child, it is her fault for not being prepared.
816	It is ironic that pro-lifers want live children so they can grow up to be dead soldiers. Women are people as well, and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.
817	How would we be able to adapt to different environments? Over time we have adapted to what is best for us. Why aren't we all the same skin color? Why are there so many different types of animals?
818	I enjoy pornography, and jerking off is always enjoyable.
819	Yes, women are degraded by pornography, but if it's already done, why should we not watch it? We can't stop something that has already happened, so let's just go for it.
820	A person who helps the community and puts other people first will most certainly live a better life.
821	I am in the middle because I always think that helping people is a good thing and a way to get blessings, but sometimes you have to help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide for yourself.
822	Personally, I think that personal pursuit is better. There is no reason really, but I feel that I can help the people I care about most if I look out for myself rather than the world. In the end, I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about, in return, it helps me even more.
823	Frankly, if kids did not dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it would not be a problem. However, since a lot of them do, school districts have to turn to such a thing. The argument of individuality is useless. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and wearing different clothes after school? And it is not the schools job to ensure that every kid gets to express their opinion. School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a nightclub.
824	It is a good idea. Every morning I think about what to wear and it was a problem. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me. It happened not often but it is a problem.
825	I agree that uniforms are a good idea. When I was studying at school, it was not a problem with what to wear. At university, however, I spend too much time choosing clothes. Firstly, it is wasting time. Secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there would not be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equal status.
826	I believe that uniform is essential in developing countries.
827	If you want your children to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. However, do not cry to me that your children are underachieving, easily distracted, and cannot focus their attention for five minutes in class.
828	I believe that wearing school uniforms should be encouraged because it reminds children that they are equal at school. It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.
829	It is better to have a bad father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and motivate you to do better. You will never have that question in your mind about what it would have been like to have a father.
830	I would rather have a lousy father than not have a father at all. If he is lousy, he cares for you and loves you. You can talk to him and get some sense out of him. It would hurt me not to know who my father is.
831	I would much rather have a lousy father than be fatherless because every dad is lousy in their own way.
832	Do not worry, potato U is not alone.
833	The books are not as good as the movies because it is harder to spell.
834	TV is better than books because you learn better by watching rather than reading.
835	I do not want my children to learn that homosexuals are ok.
836	I have already had my say in the debate and we Indians at least managed to learn these mongrel's language and we are pretty good at it. But the rest of you English gimmicks stumble in your own tongue. I am quoting some sush102 "Hey its better dnt teach me what is the difference between chatting and debate. If I start my debate and then you bloody will be forced to leave this site nd run away...." What crap? "dnt", "ma" "dis" what kind of crap is that??? It makes no difference what you say but it still remains that Indians are the best!!!!
837	The Indian economy is galloping at a breakneck speed and might even reach double-digit growth by 2013, say Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. Many economists agree that the demographic dividend that India enjoys could see the country sustain its high growth rate for a long time to come.
838	India certainly has the potential to lead the world. In our real world power and weapons don't work anymore maybe. Maybe the USA, UK or such other countries are more powerful but India is economically stronger. It is the hub for many other companies.
839	India is on my list of countries to watch in the next thirty years. I believe they will be a contender for superpower status before the end of this century.
840	Even if there was valid proof for the existence of a god, there would not be any valid proof that the god is Christian or not.
841	You can spank children as long as it is done in moderation.
842	I agree, but it must be used as the last source and not used constantly and it is not too hard.
843	Yes, children are becoming more and more violent and need to be disciplined if they choose to act violently.
844	Yes, if they are afraid of getting spanked, they will not do it again. The parent should only spank them and not go overboard and continue hitting them.
845	Humans have been raised for thousands of years without much resentment towards spanking. Today's kids are the unruliest there are. There is a trend.
846	I am a Christian, so I have to stand up for what I believe. I also get to go to church.
847	I am neither Christian nor Atheist, but I believe that Christianity is better than Atheism.
848	I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the most common crime in this world. I would not want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I would not feel safe if we had children or slept next to her. I would not be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years.
849	I would agree to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer is not the happiest life you can have, knowing that every day you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger.
850	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, which can get you in major trouble, even if you are an acquaintance. It could have been accidental, someone trying to attack her, or something else. She killed someone. The second she tells me, I will call the police. In case she goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me, I will call the police.
851	The one who bestows life will bestow the death of that person.
852	I am pro-life because abortion is being used as a last minute form of birth control. If you are too stupid to wear protection, then you should get on the pill and give up your child. There are thousands of people who cannot have children who would love to have it.
853	What if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if they are raped? Does that give them the right to get out and kill someone?
854	I advocate for the rights of the child, who deserves the same rights as the mother.
855	Physical Education should be an elective subject since many students do not like it.
856	This is not a commonly known fact. Can you point me to a reference? Or do you mean that homosexual sex is helping spread AIDS? In which case gay marriage may help reduce the problem.
857	I have many gay friends and I am for it! People should stop being so against it because it is not right.
858	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one female and the other male. I have no problem being around them.
859	Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you can't improve yourself? People may see that as selfish, but you can't help others if you can't help yourself.
860	I do not think many countries consider men with men acceptable. It is almost always taboo in society/main religions. I doubt as a whole people will ever really accept the union as a union under god. However, they should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that's what they are doing. Ignorant people seem to get these two mixed up. It is their business what happens under the sheets.
861	Yes, they do have more power than they advertise. Since September 11, 2001, the government has passed things such as the Patriot Act and Terror Watch. The Patriot Act allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on law abiding citizens. Additionally, the Patriot Act allows the government to search cars, homes, and businesses without a warrant, which is contrary to the writing of the constitution.
862	Should they be arrested? No, but there should definitely be a huge fine!! I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and I drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time. The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic. You would be surprised at the amount of cars that don't pull over right away. The idiots who don't pull over are usually on the phone, too occupied to pay attention to their surroundings. Hands free phones don't help that much either. You can have a conversation in your car with a passenger without much trouble because they can see what's going on with traffic too and sometimes can even point things out for the driver. The person on the other end of the phone is just a distraction for the driver and offers no help at all. Guess what is becoming the biggest excuse/cause for traffic accidents? I was on my cell phone and didn't see it coming.
863	I do not believe in psychics, but if in a desperate situation, most people would do anything to get things done. For example, a friend of mine had a sister who was missing for almost two years. After consulting a psychic, the sister's body was found.
864	I think these people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried, go back to the chat room and ask what they can do to keep you safe. I do not think you can be traced by the paedo because of data protection. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain what you are worried about.
865	The difficulty in answering yes and no questions is not so much the specific question and the honest answer, but the implications of that answer.
866	Many abortionists do not view the issue as black and white, but each person has their own morals and conscience.
867	I am appalled at the way children use the term "spastic" as an insult. What are they learning at home to be so insensitive? It doesn't get better.
868	I think this may be very bad for all the police trying to do their jobs. What in God's name were they thinking? Some idiot right wingers may think this is OK but heaven help the cops.
869	I assume you are referring to the entire criminal justice system as the professional group. As in the series Law and Order, it involves enforcement as well as the legal profession. However, it is not always easy to define. Power and influence in an ideal democaracy would come from the people but we know that isn't really true, money will sway public opinion and buy almost any election and swing almost any vote.
870	I doubt the police would do anything about this. However, a lawsuit would be expensive and messy for both parties. You're better off letting it slide, taking the high road and living your life honorably, knowing that these people are petty and not worthy of your attention. Light always shines through the darkness and I am sure the people who know you are aware of your character.
871	Violent rape and child molestation deserve the death penalty, though I would settle for life. We have sex offender lists to protect the public against these people who have been let out of prison. What sense does this make? We make the lists because they are still dangerous, but if they are dangerous, why are they out of prison? I say, just kill them all. Problem solved.
872	Some lawyers speak in a very demanding voice in an attempt to undermine your confidence and to dispute the truth of your statements. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is not to play into this tricky by keeping a cool head, remain calm at all times. If you seem unconfident, you may lose your case.
873	That is just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...It is just "feel good" legislation. It makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime while letting the criminals run rampant. Statistics show that criminals do less when they are faced with a well-armed citizen. Crime rates drop.
874	This is a left at the gate horse. First you would need a lawyer to win. That constitutional right about bringing your own case is wiped out by judges who do not want to be bothered by non-lawyers. Second you would need evidence that the person caused you "Increased anxiety" as the testimony of a theist. Then it would depend on your stat laws. This is a hard case to prove.
875	It matters to those of us who attended schools where all this was important, have or had parents to whom it was important, and have jobs where it is important. If you can get through life without any of those things, then you may well conclude that it is all somewhat irrelevant. Who can blame you?
876	You may have heard that your grandfather died for freedom, but people are free to talk how they want to talk and write how they want to write. If you do not like it, you do not have to talk to them or do business at a place that caters to Spanish speaking people.
877	Unfortunately, oil is the rule of all politics. However, can I suggest a simple alternative that we could all see as common sense? Use wind or wave power to generate electricity. Use this energy to split water into its prime components. Let oxygen into the air. Burn Hydrogen in our cars and have water as the resulting by product. You could almost make this work in your backyard! We would only need lubricating oils then which could probably be created from vegetable sources!
878	I think you should forgive some portion of the debt because she was behind in what she was supposed to be paying you. From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract: offer and acceptance. In your question, you say that you do not want to pursue legal action against your granddaughter, for which you are to be commended. In order to salvage your relationship with her, I think you should repay her, tell her that this is the only wedding gift you can afford is repaying the debt, and let it go.
879	It should be legal. Prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. It doesn't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while there.
880	You will not receive a warrant, but they are not required to notify you that a warrant has been issued. Call the court and make payment arrangements. You will have to pay the original fine, plus warrant fees, possibly interest, and any other fees that the local laws allow them to add. Or, you can just ignore it and the next time you are stopped for a simple traffic violation, you can be arrested for an outstanding warrant.
881	EDIT: Don't bash Clinton! He eliminated the deficit and we had a surplus for a short time. All the while we survived and the economy was good. Bush blew it. He saddled us with that deficit. What is it up to? Eight trillion plus? Who is paying for the Iraq war? Who is paying to rebuild the place? Where is the Iraqi oil money? They are selling oil. Where do you think that money is going?
882	In my opinion, psychological treatment is the best way to treat criminals, rather than sending them to prison. I believe that nobody is born to be a criminal. The primary determinant for a person to be such is being raised in a not-so-wholesome family environment. With the help of psychologists and psychiatrists, the bad behaviors of those persons can be cured and remedied.
883	We have got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there scratching each other's backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. We need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate. Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They have already earned their lifetime pension and benefits.
884	I am having a hard time believing you actually got fined for tossing a butt out of your window, unless your area has a risk of forest fire, then I understand. Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation. Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage? Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road? The main question you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?" If you think that you can win the case then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system so great. The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.
885	If they are in your car and you are driving, then yes. However, in California you are responsible for the passengers in your car, whether or not they are wearing a seatbelt. Additionally, if one of your passengers is not wearing a seatbelt, you can get a ticket in addition to them getting one, even if they are an adult. Additionally, if they are not in your car, or even if you are not driving, you are not responsible for them unless you and their parents sign something saying that you are.
886	You have to be careful how you play your game here because if he can prove that your statements are false, he may have grounds for a deformation suit. If he has wronged you, there are a few things you can do: 1. Sue him for the wrong he did to you. 2. Contact the Better Business Bureau in your area. 3. Report what he did to the government group that regulates car dealers in your area. 4. Contact the TV station in your area that does customer complaint reporting.
887	If you are going to lose your job and possibly your home due to lack of money, you should seek legal advice. You will not need to know that you have asked a lawyer. The lawyer will advise you if you have a chance. It will not cost you anything to ask a lawyer.
888	How can it not? Inside they have their own laws, and I do not mean prison laws. To live you must obey them, if not you could very well end up dead.
889	I do not understand how he took the kids away from their mother, that is something that is extremely hard to do in the courts. However, if she wants her family back and feels that if she does not have her family back then there is no meaning in her life, then support her and remind her to be careful and try to save some money on the side for herself just in case. Perhaps he realized that the grass was not greener on the other side and now he wants his old happy life back, so help her secretly save some money as a just in case fund. I wish your sister the best.
890	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country, this creates a state within the statue, which is usually thought to be a distinguishing feature of dictatorships, in which secret services, torturers, etc. are also neither answerable to the law nor to the people.
891	Why, a gay man here, can be fired for being gay at any job in the country, can't have a civil union with my partner of 9 years, and have no domestic partner rights. If it were up to some, I would be better off on some deserted island with like kind, not free for me, but still grateful to be an American and for those fighting for what rights I do have.
892	Women's bodies tell them when they are ready to have a period, but mature enough to do so is another matter entirely.
893	You can be emancipated if you are not pregnant, but it provides a judge with a fairly obvious reason to approve the request. I did it. It took about 30 minutes to fill out the forms, sign a few signatures, and 5 minutes in front of the judge. It was fairly easy. I would recommend it if you are going to need to sign for things on behalf of your child. Most people won't question you, but it's good to have in your back pocket, just in case.
894	I do not think it is fair that people are given the death penalty for having a lethal injection without any pain medication. When they die, they have no worries and then we get to pay for it with our tax dollars. The person or family who committed the crime is usually tortured and suffers for the rest of their lives.
895	What does that mean? Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights. By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.
896	I believe that our lives are our own and no one has the right to take it, except ourselves. If the pain, suffering, and lack of hope is unbearable, one should have the right to end his or her own life, either by himself or by asking someone else to do it.
897	The brain is made up of many different cells and each cell reacts to the same stimuli in exactly the same way. Essentially, you never had a choice.
898	I think dishwashers are overrated, undercapable, and overpriced appliances that have no place in a modern kitchen.
899	"White Privilege" is the term used to describe the fact that white people have better off lives than minorities. It is similar to the assumption that all African-Americans grow up in poverty and are lucky to have a nice life.
900	The invasion of gaza is unjustified and impractical. It is the same as Iraq, you don't stop terrorism by coming in and fucking peoples lives. Palestinians already hate Israel and terrorizing gaza only radicalises people and turns them into hamas militants. Apart from that Israel has shown blatant disregard for civilian lives, 50 Israelis have died compared to 1500 palestinian. That alone should show you who is the aggressor and who is caught in the crossfire.
901	Some of the arguments against amnesty for illegals have yet provided any rational reasons as to why they should be given citizenship.
902	The argument is also proven false by the fact that soda existed long before the current obesity epidemic, and soda has gradually gotten more expensive over the years and consumption hasn't dropped enough to prove that pricing is a huge factor. The comparison to cigarettes and tobacco is flawed as soda is not an addictive substance, and in moderation causes no damage to the human body, but in constant to cigarettes which even in moderation can be very damaging.
903	I did not enjoy the movie, and I do not understand why anyone enjoyed it.
904	I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it does not hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public.
905	I am merely looking at Type I diabetics. It is estimated that 1% of the US population is a type I diabetic, so 3 million people. Without an industrial system to make the insulin they need, they will all be dead within days or weeks. It is impossible to manufacture insulin outside of the industrial system. The history of type I diabetics before the modern times has been that they simply die as they slip into a diabetic coma. Is there any way to manufacture insulin outside of an industrial system? If not, then I think 3 million type I diabetics will be dead within weeks of a total industrial collapse.
906	I believe that schools should provide free, quality lunches for their pupils.
907	Prostitution is between two consenting adults. It is the choice of the prostitute as to how she earns the money and uses her body. To address people who claim prostitutes are "at the mercy" of their clients, this makes government regulation even more necessary.
908	I understand there is a lot of disdain towards people who post a question or an image that has been previously posted. However, I personally think it's a good thing that people do that.
909	Private property owners calling a towing company to remove a vehicle from their property should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the nearest available public roadway or grounds. If the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police-owned impound lot.
910	I have read some scientific racism writing and I think many of its claims have no scientific basis. Shouldn't the differences between races be studied? People of different origins have different bodies, skin color, etc. Why wouldn't they have a different brain? On the one hand, I don't want such research to be done because that could be misinterpreted by hateful people and lead to a resurgence of racism.
911	While the relic is interesting it has little historical significance. Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose.
912	Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human history. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source.
913	I think we should be putting millions into research of doing cool animal combinations. For example, a half gorilla half octopus. The face is similar to an octopus and has 2 legs and 6 wavy arms and it is also furry. I do not buy the "don't play god" argument because I am not worried about god smiting us for creating abominations. Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering around your house. Sure the research would cost a lot and some animals might get hurt but I really feel the end result would be worth it.
914	I am a professional software engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field. Software should never be patented, just copyrighted. Most software algorithms are not non-obvious. Most software algorithms are also obvious to people in the field. JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression (DCT, Run-length encoding etc.). The only thing that should be protectable is the final product. It does not give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products.
915	I am not the one who created this topic, but people free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line. It does not matter how good those Randite arguments sound in theory, 100% pure capitalism will not work.
916	I think black people give a bad name because they are mostly black and you barely see white people on television when something bad happens. I am not saying white people are not bad, just that they are mostly black.
917	I believe that if we involve manners in this issue, we will not have a problem.
918	I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now I have to admit that there is little chance of the facts being available to them via regional news vendors. This might be a decent plan B. Do what you are told America, but by someone marginally smarter than the current guy. Apathy has worked well so far and TV tells you which burger taste best, so I guess they know which President is best.
919	I do not think it is a waste of time, but I think it is pointless because our world (Earth) has its own bigger problems like world poverty, population, pollution, and the biggest threat...Global warming. Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could be focused on our world problems first and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and near the end we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientist caring too much about other things when their lives also could be in stake.
920	There should be domain extensions that are specific to "unsavory" industries. For example, porn sites should all be required to use a.xxx extension so that a router can be programmed to block all incoming connections from a.xxx site. This way, parents can block a whole group of sites by blocking domain extensions.
921	This is easy to understand. Classical music is stagnant, most classical music fans are snobbish, they want to hear exactly how it was performed several centuries ago. They put down so-called "neo-classical" music. Jazz is constantly evolving, it is a living art form. It is always adapting the latest music trends. It can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, R&B, soul, hip hop, world music, folklore, etc. and it is still jazz. Yes, they are purists but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way two times, it is different and fresh every time it is played. Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the US of A-New Orleans, made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown. Jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity.
922	While the ruling did make headlines, most people do not understand how important it really was. The right of Habeus Corpus is foundational to a free society and to liberty for all.
923	I am a cynic and a skeptic, but there is nothing I believe in more than I believe in love.
924	Test cricket is dying out, let's get rid of it and let's get rid of the boring whites and boring defensive play.
925	Each religion is in the process spreading their count, they do not care if they believe from the heart. Perhaps that is the reason why most terrorists are converted. Perhaps that is the reason why poor people are converted to Christianity because they are shown the bait of money.
926	The Terminator is made of full metal and can live for millions of years. He can see everything in the dark and is much smarter than Rob Cop.
927	I feel that this position weakens the USA. It is time for the US government to realize that we can talk to Cuba, Iran, and Hamas as part of a comprehensive foreign policy approach. By shutting the door on diplomacy, we actually encourage aggression against the USA.
928	How are you going to enforce it? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car", will certainty give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of taxpayers? Cops already doing tests if they suspect you were drinking, it's not random but probable cause. Guess what? If you were drinking and cops do not suspect your drinking habits, it is because your alcoholic content is below DUI. Some cops do not like the extra effort, and paperwork stopping people for DUI. Do you think random testing will solve this problem?
929	I apologize for the lack of information. The media has become a breeding ground for industry and rich businessmen with cigars. They no longer inform.
930	I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes. Doodling has helped me focus more on what my teachers are saying. Simple squiggly lines do the best. Though I must admit that when I start to "doodle" my doodles tend to turn into full blown drawings, shading and color thrown in the mix. That's when I get off task. I should probably figure out how to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just sketch and doodle stuff.
931	I will say the machines, simply because it does not matter which kind of machine we are talking about, Terminor or I robot, they are not easy to kill. Zombies, one shot to the head or taking the head off, and that is it. Also, machines can control other machines like cars, supercomputers, cell phones, a whole city's power supply, and military weapons like jets and tanks, and so on.
932	Indeed, why? It's mere presence should be as unusual as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation. It should not be a part of what we are. We are the product of millions of years of evolution in a world of chance that has no God.
933	It had a good plot, and a good twist. It had a moral underlying it all. If you are going to complain about the audio as your reason for it being a bad movie, then you need to get off your pretentious pedestal and spend more time with the rest of humanity.
934	We went to eat here last Friday and the food was delicious. I really liked the F'n Loaded Sliders, filet mignon mixed with blue cheese and a bottom less basket of garlic fries. It was so good and the prices are not what you would expect for such a delicious meal.
935	I have not been to a Sizzler in decades, but the quality of food and service at this location was very good.
936	I love that you can order half sizes of the appetizers. It is great for when you want something light or you like variety. My wife and I usually bring our dog, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown and split half an order of the cheesy-crab dip with pita. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For half an order of nachos, you would be surprised at how big they are. I have been here for lunch and had the chicken and rice, fish tacos, and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner. This is a great choice, and one a nice day, you cannot beat that location and view on the patio!
937	The front desk was not helpful and I had to wait for ten minutes before I gave up. I will stay again if I have no other choice but make sure I have everything I need before leaving the front desk.
938	I do not care about Tiesto or Calvin Harris playing here. It is a joke. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult or hurt them. My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and sore for a few days. Way to have a 300lb security guard push a shove/grab a 120lb woman in heals. I hope your ego is soaring. And we had not had a drink yet.
939	The service was not great either. It took a long time to get our food and our server forgot to put our order for the kids. We decided to just forego the additional wait and go somewhere else to eat.
940	We tried Carpe Diem a few times before their move to Elizabeth. We tried it again today for our anniversary dinner. The food was awful. It was over-seasoned, overdone, and the steak was overcooked. The salad was uninteresting and the dressing was boring. The meatballs were not very good.
941	The service was very good, but the food was very expensive and boring.
942	I would agree with it in private schools, but not in public schools because it is voluntary. I think school uniforms suppress free speech and take away a youth's individuality.
943	I was forced to wear one for four years at school.
944	It is uncomfortable to sit for hours in a classroom.
945	I am using Firefox right now because it makes searching the internet easier than using Internet Explorer.
946	The fact that the only rational argument for IE users is that they are cooler or more attractive proves that firefox is better.
947	At least Firefox is not a copycat like Internet Explorer 7, which copied Firefox onto tabs.
948	That is even better than a prenup. She said, "I'm leaving you and taking half your shit." I said, "Hope you like prison."
949	As human beings, we are selfish and have been crafted with a survival mechanism that tells us to do whatever whenever to protect the ones that we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if it means taking this horrible secret to the grave.
950	If my wife were to commit murder and I were to inform her, I would not turn her in because if you really loved her, you would have her back no matter what.
951	I do not believe I would turn them in for love, but I certainly would not stay with her. I would move away from her as far as I could. Because I knew about the crime.
952	India was most successful when ruled by other empires. They cannot even lead themselves.
953	No, last time I checked, rags were for cleaning toilets, not headgear.
954	I am going to get down-voted and insulted, but my writing is the truth.
955	I would rather be less fatherly. It might sound bad but I do not want to think of my father as a lousy one. I would love my father but it would not be the same if you had a bad father that just kept bringing you problems. You do not have to have a father you can talk to someone else. Maybe it is just because I am a girl it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.
956	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be tough and dependent on themselves.
957	Farquhar has a boss who runs raffles so he has to follow raffles and not do anything else. If he is fired, then why cant Farquhar help Singapore?
958	The Dutch were upset that Singapore would be taken by the British, but Raffles stopped them from taking Singapore.
959	Is porn good for your health? No, opponents say that porn does not have a serious effects on health. However, studies have shown that porn and practice can damage your health slowly, especially your immune system. Sooner or later, those who do porn in their relationships definitely do not have good health as others. Here is a key question. Smoking is bad for you. Smokers feel good when they smoke but smoking 100% leads to their death and porn has the same influence on the health. I think that smoking is better than porn in fact, both of them are extremely bad for you.
960	Firefox is bloated now and uses way more memory than it should. Once everyone buys a new PC and gets IE7, they will have no excuse to switch to Firefox.
961	The page title and address is displayed in the tooltip when hovering over the tabs in IE7.
962	IE is much easier to use, and is more visually appealing.
963	Most people think that physical education is useless because the only thing you would normally do in a PE class is run around. However, there is more to it than just running around the field for an hour.
964	It should be mandatory for children to participate in physical activity and participate in sports, even through PE. Additionally, there is a benefit to working together as a team, which is not always the case in other classes.
965	You are correct because I am in PE and they make us wear those stupid outfits. I think they make us wear those so the gay coaches can see our private parts.
966	William Farquhar was dismissed because despite his many positive achievements in Singapore's development, he took measures in his administration which conflicted with Raffles' instructions. As a result, many people would just ignore Farquhar's contribution and credit it to Raffles.
967	When Farquar was fired by Raffles, he was given a larger ceremony before he left than Raffles, which shows how much the people loved him.
968	William Farquhar was there to deal with the country's problems when Raffles was not there for them. He even took money out of his own pockets to resolve certain issues. When he was forced to leave, the people sent him off with sorrow in their hearts.
969	I do not believe that the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision for parents to make, not the government.
970	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is not very intelligent. This is why these kinds of debates are pointless.
971	Early man's understanding of the universe was extremely limited. People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical. However, man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back.
972	Evolution does occur and it has been documented and studied. I invite you to read this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and then you can give your thoughts. Thank you.
973	Pornography is not wrong. As an abstract noun, it cannot be wrong.
974	Pornography is a way to release all of the desire that people have for sex.
975	The question is who has the right to prohibit it? The government. Why would there be any pressing need at all for the state to outlaw pornography? I don't see any moral depravity in Europe, do you?
976	Porn is not always wrong, but it isn't always right.
977	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day, our parents or teachers taught us about team work.
978	As fashion and trends change, students are more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they are with their academic success and achievement.
979	I think that school uniforms are a good idea. First of all, it makes students look nice and tidy. Second, we can find out who is studying in which school and who is in the same school as us. And third, it's convenient because we don't have to spend too much time choosing clothes for school.
980	I think that it would be better to have an lousy father than no father. At least you have an idea of who he is and where he is. You will also get an idea of what you will be like when you grow up. If he is an lousy father, that will help you not be like him. You want to be better than him.
981	I would rather have a lousy father than none.
982	Yes, I have a bottle of water next to me. It is no bid deal.
983	Bottled water should only be used for emergencies, not for pollution of the environment or harming habitats by dumping it in the ocean or landfill. Plastic does not decompose, so it should not be used for emergencies.
984	TV is better because you can get information from different sources in a short time, whereas books take a lot of time to get that much information.
985	They can be recycled to make other things, like more water bottles. It also makes the water companies rich. They are not expensive, it costs three bucks to buy one of those big packs at shaws. That will keep you hydrated for a few weeks without thirst.
986	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would lose millions of dollars.
987	God created water bottles for a reason. Because it is good.
988	Without plastic water bottles, we could easily walk the block with a safe supply of water in our hands.
989	I like this website, but I do not find it very clear. This website is better, theworlddebating.com
990	Here is a reason why gay marriage is okay. If gay marriage is okay, then sister and brother marriage is okay too. What is the difference? The sex is the difference, so sister and brother are okay. Brother and brother are okay.
991	India has the potential to lead the world. Dr. Manmohan Singh is considered to be the most qualified prime minister in the world. India has proved its potential in various fields and aspects.
992	I would like to point out how few disputes there are on the Christian side. That is because free minded people do not need to convince others. We know that there is not a god, and that it is up to us to make our lives.
993	For reasons that should be quite clear, and which I assume have been thoroughly explained by the others involved.
994	Yes, because one getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up, and secondly it makes you listen. It is not ABUSE that you are being spanked.
995	It should be used to get the message across to the child.
996	I am disappointed that our religion is not recognized. I am a theist, so I must be on this side.
997	A parent should not use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot. This will cause a low self-esteem. Also, spanking should not be an option because at that moment the parent would be full of anger and they would not be thinking rationally.
998	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated equally. I would not want my child to hit me.
999	As an ambitious young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder would not have been committed in a way that was a pleasure or malicious act, so that the sentencing would not be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1000	Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and then one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because it is on their mind that you know the truth and the truth can't get out. They need to get rid of all types of clues, even of those they love, in case they try to talk to someone.
1001	I am not glib, but are you stating that we should look to the government to assist us with our belief system. Have you ever read T. Hobbes?
1002	I believe abortion is morally right, but it is not in every case.
1003	I do not see any difference in killing an embroider or a 40 year old person. Murder is murder.
1004	Why do we argue for the right to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?
1005	The Champ, you are not talking about a woman's body, you are talking about a new life. Do not let a new life die because of you.
1006	Besides, only a few people apply physical exercise in their lives.
1007	A PE teacher must have an easy job because they do not need to learn anything. All they have to do is yell at children for an hour.
1008	Gym class is a waste of time. There should be a test so that people can run a mile without stopping every couple feet. Additionally, people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should use that class time towards their careers.
1009	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages affecting anyone but the two of you getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want to be together, let them do something else to show they love each other.
1010	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle if you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" if you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."
1011	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people who want to be the best they can be.
1012	I believe it is more important to have personal pursuits because if you want to help others, you have to help yourself. It is not bad to want to help the common good, but if you always put other people before yourself, you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life.
1013	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must be happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for yourself, you will become a wreck and you will not have any happiness in your life.
1014	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this.
1015	I believe that personal pursuit is better because it is more about you than other people. If you cannot focus on yourself, how can you focus on others or help others around you? I am not saying advancing the common good is bad, I am saying it is better to focus on yourself.
1016	Honestly, I believe that both are good, there is no better in this argument, because they both have that significance and balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve yourself for others and the environment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I do not expect it to be that way.
1017	Girls are out looking for a good time with guys in maybe the wrong places..ie the bar or disco or late night parties because guys are "lacing" drinks with drugs quite easily because the media portrays "a good time" for young people as having sex and not cool with it..so they react by going all out with guys because they are not as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming victims of date rape.
1018	The conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. I do not know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama. Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it. You should avoid these people.
1019	I do not "believe in god" either, and I will not swear an oath to any state or government. I instead make only a documented affirmation, which works and is completely legal. It also saves notary fees.
1020	It is a shame people act so selfishly and unethical towards each other when their parent dies.
1021	The purpose of punishment is to reform the criminals but in some cases the criminal is beyond the process of reformation and he starts enjoying his criminal acts.
1022	If you are driving, your attention is diverted into dialing a number, and it's always best to have two hands on the steering wheel. Please avoid using your cell phone while driving. Although it may be illegal in your state, it's always best to set an example.
1023	Firstly, the ACLU would have nothing to do with this case. They generally only take cases involving government infringing on people's civil liberties. Second of all, where is your source for this case? You have a few specific details, so surely you must have some news story or a link to more information. I have a hard time believing your statement. Thirdly, the answer to your question is "no."
1024	Is it not the NY Times? At least they happen to be the paper that the Bush administration is targeting. Although the government has a web site and a magazine dedicated to this very issue! Not to mention all the other media organizations that printed the same story. What a scam! Bush himself has made over a dozen public statements since September 2001, mentioning how they are disrupting "terrorist" funding!!!
1025	Regardless of what the government provides as services for those who are ill, it shouldn't have the right to totally ban the use of certain substances, especially when those substances are LESS harmful than the ones that are legal. Wake up! You can die by drinking too much water! Just because you'll get help from a hospital or something doesn't mean they should ban water.
1026	Looks like you are afraid of him having rights to raise the child should you die. If you do not want him to have rights to the child, you will need to get him to sign a legal document naming his rights away. Of course, if he does sign his rights away, he will not be liable for child support. Check with your local social services office and ask them "If he signs away his rights to this child will /can the back child support still be collected?"... Yes, do bring him forth & establish paternity.
1027	Even when the sentence was ridiculous to begin with? Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehabilitation, not housing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals.
1028	You should try to resolve the issue before they come after you. They will notice this and catch on to it. Today, in most states, employees have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws. This will be a way for them to catch you. The other major issue is with your taxes. When you file, they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands name and/or your name.
1029	I do not know where you are coming from, but they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care. It costs the state tons of money. My sister does this for a living, and their departments are severely underfunded and understaffed. The workers do what they can, but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officials that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads, the situation is not going to improve. It is really sad.
1030	I am not sure I understand the supposition you are making, but in general, I would argue that moral and legal can be viewed as a Venn diagram. An act can be both, one of the other, or neither. We probably wouldn't want it any other way, actually.
1031	I do not know. I always call my electrician to fix my plumbing. Perhaps the defense lawyer is more of a general practice attorney that works on many different types of cases. Or, perhaps he (or your husband) is an idiot. Worst case scenario - he is trying to save the ability to claim inadequate representation if you kick him around in court.
1032	I do not like or admire the actions of the United States of America. For example, I think the war in Iraq was a huge mistake.
1033	If you live in Michigan, they will. Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking.
1034	I am sorry to hear the UK is going down such an ugly path. I believe that you have the right to swing your arms around a few inches from your face. I believe that you have the right to say what you want, unless it threatens someone else.
1035	It depends on what you are trying to achieve and the impression you want to create. If you are trying to give the impression that you are a fine citizen who should be let off the hook, then I would choose none of the above and choose something more traditional. If you are not concerned with the impression you are trying to create, then I would choose the Birks.
1036	Civil rights- we are innocent until proven guilty, and having everyone on a database would be taking the opposite stance.
1037	I think the sentencing of murderers and rapists should be harsher. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.
1038	It is not legal because it can't be regulated by the government. It is generally regarded as a gateway drug that leads to other, more dangerous drug use. Legalizing it would not only lead to a massive initial interest in it, which would lead to increased health care costs (don't front; it damages respiratory systems and impairs judgment) and decrease labor quality. Additionally, all those drug dealers who sold weed would need to find something else to do, and my guess is it wouldn't be a legit job. It would also cause a spike in crime, probably gun sales, or increased trafficking in worse narcotics. It is a dumb idea.
1039	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other? If it involves a hot woman and a male minor then it is good. If it involves a guy and a girl minor then it is bad. If it involves two minors together then the laws should be less harsh than they are now. A good example would be when a hot teacher gets in jail for doing it with a male student. For what? To make him one of the luckiest guys alive?
1040	If everything is okay between you and your mother, then you should be able to leave on your own. Check the local laws and statutes in your town. Most states have 18 years old as the legal age, but there are exceptions. If you go live with a relative and you are "underage", then a guardianship contract will have to be amended by both parties, your parents and your live-in relatives or adult-head of house. But I do not think they will make a big thing out of just being one year away from adulthood for you, or anyone else, anywhere! I say, just pack your bags, and with your mom's blessing, go off and find your destiny as my child! Have fun and stay out of trouble, okay?
1041	Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off. I favor harvesting stem cells from donated cord blood and see no reason at all why embryonic cells are needed at all in order to do the research that holds such incredible promise.
1042	I think it is a joke to make murder punishable by murder. I would much prefer the death penalty, and many people on death row do not see it that way.
1043	I am not sure, but I often ask myself that same question. The most honest answer might be because we can control our technology, and we have the power to control proliferation too because we see it as a danger. In general, it's not a good idea for every Tom, Dick, and Harry to have nuclear bombs. Do you really think nothing bad would happen if every country had enough bombs to destroy the planet? Yes, that would be great. I do have to admit there is a certain irony to the United States being so controlling about nukes. We say we can't trust others to have them, but who's the only country crazy enough in the history of the world to actually use one.
1044	You should be aware that the people you will deal with operate on the law of the jungle. The strong survive and power means everything.
1045	I know it is a cliché but it is not offensive to you. India is rich in history and has many things to offer. If you think it is poor it stays poor, but if you can write better English, more people get jobs and India becomes rich.
1046	If you listen, they say "You have the right to remain silent." It is simply their right not to say anything. Also, when you are being questioned, you are not always a criminal, but you are first innocent.
1047	If the person is mentally handicapped and can prove it, then I do not suppose the person should be prosecuted. However, if someone is supposed to be taking care of or has guardianship of the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. I also think Hunger is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue. If it is not, it should be.
1048	You are using the equipment provided for you as an employee, and the school has the right to ensure that it is not being used for illegal purposes. If you do not like the terms of the contract you sign so that you can use school computers for e-mail, then you should stop using it. Additionally, they will monitor the web sites that you and your pupils visit.
1049	We are not taught from a young age to respect alcohol. If we treated it more like Europeans it would not be considered taboo. Also, those stupid ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You aint sexy when you get drunk.
1050	I would say 18 years old, but you should be finishing high school and have lived under your parents law long enough to be able to go fight wars and vote. As for drinking, let me tell you it is not that hard if someone under the age wants to drink.
1051	I think that a president of his country should be born here, because any other job can go to anyone else with legal status but not the presidency.
1052	I certainly do not fear "the competition" - besides the fact that my husband gets it good at home, most of the prostitutes I've seen are far from "very hot chicks." Most of them are drug addicts who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized they could make money off their own twat. In addition, in most places where it is legal, they are tested for diseases on a regular basis, which obviously solves a major problem.
1053	I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty.
1054	I am in a position right now where I am between jobs and in a general transition phase in my life. Dealing with societal strife is meaningless. I should just withdraw from society and live out my days surrounded by cats or something.
1055	The "be yourself" attitude hurts people who have it and everybody around them. It's an excuse for doing all sorts of stupid things and not improving yourself.
1056	I am a supporter of equality, but I do not fully understand how the goal is being achieved. I have come across people who support it, but I am looking for proof of progress being made recently or how aggressiveness pays off.
1057	You have no control over where you are from, like you have no control over what color your skin is. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they are from and not how they play.
1058	I believe the two countries should be united and the South Korean system should be accepted. This coming from a Pinko commie is a difficult thing to state but I think this would be the better outcome than continuing the way it is going.
1059	I do not think the whole #bringbackourgirls is effective for the reasons stated above.
1060	I think we should conduct research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun or space in general. It would disintegrate before it even arrived at the sun. Perhaps we would be able to do it once or twice a year where we could be certain it would land. Or perhaps we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. It is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years.
1061	I know that most people are now able to have children, but I feel it is selfish. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for adoption, and to spend over $3000 just to get a surrogate does not sit right with me. Also, the most successful surrogate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little in order to use their bodies. Childbirth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking, so knowing that a woman went through that just to give birth to a child she will never see again does not seem right.
1062	I have read the comments on these articles and they do not tend to be positive. Some people tend to tend towards "Nope" or "Ick" type comments.
1063	All of my grandparents were born somewhere between the late 1920's and the end of the 1930's and according to most of what I've heard, marriage was just "something they did". Society, for whatever reason, just expected them to get married young and have children. Divorce at this time was unheard of, so if your partner changed, (as most people do), then you were just kind of stuck with someone you didn't like. I don't believe that someone is cognitively ready to make a lifelong decision at that age.
1064	I personally feel that the amount of money they're being paid is too much. I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it. Yes, this may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.
1065	I feel that companies who use cartoon or clown characters as part of their marketing strategy to kids are unethical. They establish an early link in developing impressionable minds that these products are fun and safe. When a person reaches adulthood, the link becomes permanent -- and they still consume these products out of a sense of childhood nostalgia.
1066	I am an avid sports fan and I love watching all sports, even the Winter Olympics. However, I cannot understand the massive following for baseball and American football. I've tried to sit through full games, but I find there is a severe lack of fluency and action in both sports. I feel like I am missing or not appreciating something about these sports. Please change my view, as I would love to get involved.
1067	I never tip because it reinforces the notion that employers can get away with paying substandard wages to people based on their chosen occupation. I think tipping should be abolished and employers should be legally obligated to pay a realistic and survivable wage. I've never understood why employers are allowed to pay two dollars an hour and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage. I do not feel anyone should be guilted into paying X percentage on top of the bill at a restaurant to pay the servers wage when it should be their wages.
1068	I have been in Florida's major metropolitan areas for over 30 years, and I know why my friends keep leaving the area, since it is nothing more than God's waiting room.
1069	Many communities and books have popped up in the last few years attempting to combat a potential AI doomsday situation.
1070	Increasingly, the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but it has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Implement personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If I smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police than from anyone or anything else.
1071	I am unsure about the differences between the two controllers, but I believe there is a superior layout, which one I believe is, is irrelevant, and one company simply cannot budge because of stubbornness.
1072	I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
1073	I believe that the first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference. However, the second factor is the head-to-head results between teams. I think the order of the latter two should be reversed.
1074	I do not agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, but it is the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have.
1075	Everyone knows the war on drugs is a failure. It is fine if you do not think people should be able to do drugs but you cannot say your solution is prohibition. I know a guy who can get me some pot, who can get me some acid, who can get me some meth. Squares would not believe how easy it is to buy hard drugs.
1076	I cannot see anything good in Narendra Modi in the long run. Although it may be true that he has a good economic record in Gujarat, he will destroy the religious toleration for which India is famed. It would be far better to retain Congress, who although they are corrupt as all hell are not responsible for the massacre of Muslim pilgrims.
1077	I think that could be a contributing factor. Additionally, our media does not show all the true horrors of war. For example, refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc., and the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form.
1078	I agree that legalizing marijuana would be beneficial, as long as it is not used while operating automobiles or heavy machinery.
1079	Yes, it is safer than alcohol, it is nearly impossible to overdose, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition. When it was illegal, people still did it, as did weed, and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies, which could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When prohibition was removed, organization returned to society as well.
1080	I want this website to get some attention. It has been weeks since I actually learned something or read something worthwhile here. This needs to change.
1081	This debate is not about whether kids should eat candy, but whether governments should ban ads for kids that portray candy-eating as good. It is legal for kids to eat candy, so why should it be illegal for people to tell kids that they should eat it? Besides, kids naturally like sweets, and the ads only convince them to choose one brand over another, not to start eating candy. We need to bring responsibility back to the parents instead of letting them use the government to babysit for them.
1082	There have been dozens of cases in the last 100 years where countries have invaded other nations and the world has caused uproar and rose up against it. If a stupid Texan does it and gets away with it, then he and Tony Blair should be tried for war crimes.
1083	Well, truth be told, truth is different for each and every one of us. My truth is that when I flush the toilet the water goes counter-clockwise, but for someone in Brazil the water goes counter-clockwise. Who is right? Well, in a sense we both are, scenarios define truths. Then again I could give the typical Christian answer and say Jesus is truth, The Way, the Truth and the Life.
1084	In the NFL, it is safe to say that not every position that is played is created equal. For example, kickers are not paid as much as running backs and running backs are not paid as much as quarterbacks. Consequently, quarterbacks are being paid more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions made by the quarterback.
1085	I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he understands that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill goes, but understands that the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.
1086	I would like to begin by defining what wrestling should be. Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two unHARMED persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other. Is this what we are seeing on television today? No! The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today.
1087	We all know that men want to have sex to impress their friends and show off that they got some. Then they will leave the girl after he has had sex with her and then go on to another girl. And so on. We all know that when a man comes to it, he pressures his girl to have sex when she isn't ready, and if he wants it badly enough, he will break up with her and go out with another girl. That does not make any girls feel confident about themselves, and it makes him a selfish person.
1088	We should not have to pay for education, as it is vital for society to function. If people are unable to afford the price of education, consequences will occur such as many children's futures will be destroyed. Education is what gives people the power to achieve goals and success. What right does anyone have to refuse to educate someone simply because they are unable to provide the funds required?
1089	Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." I believe that the law is eternal, and I believe that Heaven and Earth are still in existence, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happened.
1090	It is a good thing for the economy in the long run. China has been keeping its currency really low so that it can continue to provide really cheap goods to the US. If the dollar gets low enough in comparison, Chinese goods will become more expensive hurting American consumers in the short term but ultimately strengthening the domestic market for US producers.
1091	I went to this place for dinner on my last night in Montreal. It seemed to be popular, and was full on that particular night. We got a table and ordered food. There were a lot of wrong orders, and the food was not what we ordered. The sushi was good, but I felt they charged us more than what we had ordered.
1092	We had the rib taco and the brisket taco. The food was excellent. You may want to call ahead for a reservation as it gets busy.
1093	We went to Zeta's for lunch. My husband had the gyro and I had the meat shawarma pita. Both were great. They served pita bread and olive oil at the beginning. It was definitely homemade.
1094	I was very impressed with the food, drinks and the patio. I found the service to be a little slow but I like that at times. The nachos were delicious and my fish tacos were full of flavor and authentic tasting. The Caesar was one of the best I've ever had.
1095	I went there at 10/20/2013 around 6pm with a group of 6. Ordered hummus as appetizer and the main entrees were potato pizza, lobster gnocchi, roast chicken and burgers. All of us experienced diarrhea during the night, some with acid reflex and gas disturbance. I will not be returning there again.
1096	There is not much else in Mesa for wine bars, but D'Vine has always been a pleasant refuge when wanting to stay in town. It is right around the corner from my house and saves me driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale. The food has always been tasty and the staff friendly. The live music has been great so far. I wish they would stay open a little later on the weekends for us night owls.
1097	I am so in love with this place that we haven't been back in a while. We tend to forget about it a bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food is consistently excellent. Chicken, beef, and shrimp are excellent. Rice, beans, and plantains are also excellent. My only disappointment was that I tried dessert and it didn't taste like what I thought it would. Perhaps I am used to an over sugarized American version of it.
1098	I wish I would have gone to McDonalds for the same experience, if not better. Now I am enjoying a fresh bowl of salad because of the extra calories I sacrificed for nothing.
1099	I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?! The main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked,IE required you to get up a whole new browser in order to search two websites at the same time. It's pointless.
1100	I have FireFox and it is the best browser.
1101	I would not turn in my husband if he committed murder. I am going to be there for him no matter what. I know he made a big mistake and should pay for it, but I do not think I have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be there for each other no matter how bad it is.
1102	I do not think I could turn my spouse in or my family and friends if they committed a murder because those people are too close to me and I cannot imagine my life without them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, especially if you live with them?
1103	I think books are better because they have you use your imagination and the more you read the more your imagination improves. Also, I hate commercials and Spongebob.
1104	Books help reduce our electricity bills, which uses up much of our spending money.
1105	Books make you smarter and they can also tell what people are thinking.
1106	Some people who can't read are absolutely idiotic to say the people who can't read would always run away from them. I can't sleep if I won't read a chapter from a novel each day. Actually sometimes I feel reading books all day becomes boring. I watch TV and those two news channels. By reading books I can pass my time and improve my speaking skills.
1107	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literate, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. India does not have the potential and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
1108	This is not an easy question to answer because both are similar to me. I would have to say fatherless because I would rather have no man in my life than have someone that is not concerned about your life at all. That is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
1109	A father is someone who always is there for you. He is the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball and comes to all of your baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world.
1110	I think it would be better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I was always taught that a true man should be someone respectable, honest, and hard working. If he is not that kind of man then he does not deserve to be a father.
1111	I believe that both are bad, but I would rather go without a father.
1112	Raffles founded Singapore and Farquhar was just a subordinate for him. Therefore, it was normal that Raffles gave the duty of turning Singapore into a successful city and left the city to Farquhar to handle.
1113	I read that people who watch pornography are not normal. It is abnormal.
1114	This not only degrades morality, but also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women's empowerment because women are viewed as merely toys which will ultimately lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception.
1115	I think it is wrong, it goes against women's rights, and those girls are underage and abused. It is also sick in a way. What freak would film people having sex?! I do not understand. I do not understand what is so good about it.
1116	PORN is wrong, why would you want to watch people have sex? Maybe everyone feels differently, but if you want to watch people have sex, look at yourself first.
1117	Jarman is wrong because it should be in 4-D with surround sound and special effects. It would make it much more pleasurable.
1118	I am not sure how that argument works.
1119	If evolution is true, then why are people not still evolving?
1120	You must know nothing about debate because what I am doing is called "Cross Examining" and it is a very common tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position. Additionally, calling names never won a debate. You just cannot answer my questions and I am sure that is frustrating for you.
1121	Why do people think you look like monkeys?
1122	I believe that Microsoft's Internet Explorer has the best virus interface in the world, so why should you not use it?
1123	FF loads faster than IE, but 9 times out of 10 people who just installed FF will experience slower program load times than loading IE.
1124	It is an indisputable fact that the average IE user gets laid 2500% more than the average Firefox user. Sorry Firefox users, game set match, cry about IE somewhere else.
1125	If physical education is not true, then you would be a couch potato.
1126	William had to think of a solution for the many pests that were bothering the people at that time.
1127	William had legalized gambling to make Singapore prosper, but Raffles refused to do so, leaving Singapore to prosper alone.
1128	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start the colony. He offered money as an incentive for people to hunt and exterminate rats and centipedes, while Raffles did nothing of that nature.
1129	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with ideas that would or would not work. Actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas.
1130	Farquhar was exiled by Raffles, even though William had done a lot for Singapore.
1131	I do not think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. However, she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being or not.
1132	People can make the choice for themselves. It is not up to us or the government to decide to have more unwanted children.
1133	A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her stepfather and gave birth to twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout Catholics. That's three lives lost. One of those children did not even know what life was.
1134	Abortion is okay because a fetus is not a human. To be human, you must have both the following criteria: you must be human (homosapien) and you must be able to contribute to society. Therefore, abortion is not murder.
1135	I have an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life begins at conception" rather than birth. America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. Perhaps if you truly believe that life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, correct?
1136	I have to say in this issue that there is actual evidence to support evolution.
1137	Is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? Why would God have to tweak anyhow? The man is all-powerful, so he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." That all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.
1138	How come people are not still evolving? How are you so sure we are not? Could you please show some evidence that we are not evolving? And do not say, because we would notice if we were. Solid variable evidence is key to proving your point.
1139	My wife and I enjoy sharing and expanding our love in the bedroom. As long as it is legal and everyone is of legal age, then it should not be a problem.
1140	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out it's more likely that everything will come out great. You get to become a role model by helping someone that needs your help.
1141	I believe that advancing the common good is better because it not only makes you feel better, but it also makes you feel better.
1142	If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There is no other way around it.
1143	Advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit.
1144	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not selfish. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people, there would not be any use of common good. You are the only person who knows what you feel, think, and believe. If you want to change, you would change yourself.
1145	I think advancing the common good is better because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you improve the world in any way, it will also help you out.
1146	It is a good idea to separate students from other people for at least increase garment job. Why do we use soldier uniform? For separate from civil. Why terrorist not use soldier uniform? For harmonious with civil and easy to attack enemy.
1147	School uniforms do no harm to students' lives. Now imagine one bully wearing shirt, tie, pants, neatly ironed and well-polished shoes. Will not he look good? Remember, dressing sense is also part of your interview.
1148	I think it would be better to have a lousy father because at least you have someone there. Just because a father is lousy does not mean you cannot change that. Perhaps you could teach him some sense and he would change his ways. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.
1149	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to have none. It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you may become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad, because he is always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father.
1150	It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think I need it. He wouldn't care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys.
1151	I do not want to be here. It is like punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare, and then it falls apart. Bright lights turn me clean. This is worse than it seems.
1152	I think TV is better than books because you can switch between different informational channels and documentaries on different subjects. When you are done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a funny show or whatever you want to watch.
1153	If you are only fluent in a language, but you move to another country, most books are not in your language, but television is in many languages, and you can hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
1154	Same sex marrage can cause a lot of conflict, it puts people's lives at risk in extreme cases. Gay marrage has caused so much trouble that it has resulted in murder and suicide.
1155	I remember the only country by whose fear Alexander's army was afraid it was India. After sixty years of independence India is looked as the country to become the sixth member of the security council of UN and it is also the country with a great development rate. And I know that none of us are unknown to the great contribution of India in the discovery of God partical then from where the matter comes from that India is not having the potential
1156	India has the potential to lead the world, but I do not see that happening anytime soon.
1157	We have scientific evidence that the flood of Noah could not have happened.
1158	I think it is better to try a different option besides spanking, which can affect a child's way of thinking and may make them sad.
1159	I believe that spanking a child should not be tolerated. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what is right from wrong.
1160	Some parents spank their children for everything, and that is not right. They will always be scared of them.
1161	In my opinion, spanking children when they are misbehaving should never be a common occurrence.
1162	I would not marry someone who would murder someone.
1163	If my spouse committed murder, I would have to turn them in. I do not think I could continue living knowing that they murdered someone. The relationship would not be the same. It would change because now you view them as someone other than your spouse. You do not see them as your spouse anymore. You see them as a bad person who could do something to you.
1164	If my husband murdered someone, I would bring him in for the consequences of the crime. I have learned that there is a consequence for everything, and he will have to bear the consequences.
1165	I would definitely turn her in. It is murder, and she might be insane and kill me or someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house because of her killing. But it would be sad because she is your spouse and you love her, so I prefer that she never tell anyone. That makes my life easier.
1166	The vast majority of abortions in this country are performed for convenience. If I were allowed to kill someone whenever they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of corpses behind me when I walked down the street.
1167	Physical Education should be education, not punishment. It should teach students how to eat right and live a healthy lifestyle without making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track. It should show them that eating right and exercise can be fun. It should not make obese kids be bullied because they cannot run as fast as someone else.
1168	I do not care if it is called "marriage" or something else. Gays should have the same rights as a married couple. Civil unions, marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it, gays need to be recognized on that level. It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court will not take a case on this because they are leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is.
1169	There is an argument about whether gay marriage is acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most people in Britain would say it is wrong. However, I think anybody should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love. I think it is acceptable because how come we can get married to the other sexuality. A man can't express his feelings to a woman or a man and a woman as gay sexuality. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like!
1170	Firstly, homosexuals have the fundamental right of equal happiness. Secondly, they are still part of society. Thirdly, it would make the government look better if we allow the third gender to have the same rights as the first.
1171	It is a personal choice whether or not to marry a person of the same sex. However, it should not be limited to other religions or cultures. Gay people marrying do not affect your marriage to the opposite gender.
1172	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. Additionally, I believe that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others, you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself.
1173	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I am more of a selfish person. I prefer to do something that will improve my life, but sometimes it is better to do something that is going to help me.
1174	I do not think that he killed his exwife and her friend, but this book is in extremely poor taste and offensive. I think he has lost his mind and since he lost his civil court case, the revenue from his book and other gain ventures should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
1175	The first amendment of the Bill of Rights states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievance." The act of desecration of the United States flag is legal, but it is still pending further approval through our legal system.
1176	I don't think it is a harm to my rights, but I can't afford the fine.
1177	There are Scientology schools, where most kids who were born into it go. However, I have never heard of it being taught in public school. Thankfully, you wouldn't attend these schools unless you were a Scientologist.
1178	I trust all police departments and the city I live in is no exception. There are some great officers there and they try to do the best they can for the community. The chief is awesome and supports his officers.
1179	I would file a complaint with the U.S. Attorney General's office, the FBI, and your local police chief. Additionally, I would contact every media outlet I could get my hands on with the detailed story. Additionally, if you have the extra money lying around, I would file a civil suit against both the officer and the business owner. You have clearly been wronged, and do not even think about stepping down. Fight back. I've won 3 lawsuits against the police in my lifetime already, and I'm only 21 years old. We cannot stand for this outright ILLEGAL behavior by law enforcement.
1180	I would say, sentence them to life in prison and place them in our worst supermax prison and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads, "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terrorist. I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves. It may not deter anyone, but what will?
1181	It happens all over the world, even bad countries aren't held accountable. For instance, Israel was caught breaking the law (occupying another people's land) why was it protected by the US through Veto Power and not militarily kicked out like any normal country would have been? (ex. Iraq out of Kuwait etc.) In conclusion, the proper answer to your good question would be that the world isn't fair and just because some people have guns and "protection", (like some states have big guns and "protection"), the law is lenient with them.
1182	If someone in my family had been killed, I would want the person responsible to pay. And if it met going to the gas chamber or lethal injection, then so be it. It may not bring that loved one back, but I would have the satisfaction of knowing it could never go and do it to anyone else.
1183	Lets see Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945 which makes him dead. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006. Unless one of them can time travel it is impossible for them to be the same person. I understand about the different parts. I may never get to level 4 by answering all these types of questions but it is starting to get less boring.
1184	Regarding the property, if it is in your home, no one can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. Since it is unlikely the gp will falsify a police complaint, I would not worry too much about the property. Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home or property without a warrant in the majority of cases.
1185	No, we would not have to factor in unwanted people if legs would be kept closed, and there are plenty of people who want but cannot have. If self control was practiced, we would have a lot less trouble with this topic. There are a few that get raped and whatever the other excuses are, but there is adoption for that. As for health, my child has a right to live more than I do. Abortion is not really great for a woman's health, you know?
1186	If a minor is under twelve years old, I would say "No," but at twelve, I think you are pretty aware of the things you are doing and the effects of them. And there have been a couple of murders in the U.S. that were very thought out, planned, and committed by twelve and thirteen year olds. I think they should not only be tried as adults but punished as one too.
1187	I agree that liberal Democrats have made it ok to do all these things. If drugs or alcohol became a problem, they would IMMEDIATELY demand that the law be "unconstitutional." I heard that they took the picture of George Washington praying out of a school because they said that it was "unconstitutional." He was our founding father. They just took his picture out because they thought it was suggested the Christian values in the school. But they teach the kids about hinduism and judisum, but when it comes to Christianity, it is ILLEGAL to teach the kids about that.
1188	I am a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that defended liquor licenses. It is not entrapment to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol. The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors. If the decoy just says, "Oh, come on!" and the clerk agrees, then it is not entrapment.
1189	There is a reason that you have to be an adult to serve on a jury. Teens do not have the intelligence or maturity necessary to make objective decisions based on evidence. They tend to follow what their emotions are telling them, which cannot be done in a court case.
1190	If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus. There is nothing wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a "bad" place which clearly was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street. What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter, the daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street, and the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex crime crazed society.
1191	Please give up and try to accomplish something other than this useless pursuit. The chances of marijuana legalization are slim.
1192	Polygraphs use a baseline and go from there. If your friend was nervous from the start then that would be his baseline. It measures changes not overalls. The would have to be extreme for him to fail. Even if his English was not par it should not have any effect. I know you want to stand by your friend so do what you think is right. Have him volunteer for another polygraph from a different reader.
1193	I believe that affirmative action promotes reverse discrimination but is necessary in some cases. The biggest problem we are facing today is that the playing field is not as leveled as some people may think.
1194	I speak as the ex who is owed money and knows how hard it is when a jerk does not pay what he owes. Are you my ex? If so, they are looking for you. Best wishes, Sue
1195	What difference would there be? Violent career criminals will continue to be released back into society to make room for nonviolent first-time offenders like deadbeat dads, drunk drivers with multiple misdemeanor convictions (but no accidents), recreational marijuana users caught with a single joint in their possession, scam artists who prey on the wealthy, etc. Prisons should be for the long-term incarceration of major drug dealers, robbers, rapists, and murderers in order to protect society from these violent sociopaths.
1196	First drugs are illegal so punishment goes there. Under the use of drugs an act of crime occurs, may not have occurred if the accused was clean. Consider priors he/she may have had. Then put together a jail term and a drug rehab program. I would suggest a three to five year sentence and less time for good behavior. Yes, you are right about a killing being less time. That really stinks.
1197	What is their choice really? Either they do what China tells them or they offer nothing to the people there. There is no way for them to improve conditions for the people of China if the government blocks and removes them.
1198	I agree with part of the above answers. It is usually during those years children go from concrete to rational thinking. That is why some subjects are not taught until children are older. Some kids on the younger end do not know the difference between right and wrong in many cases. They can have a hard time to know what will happen, or the consequence of what they do.
1199	Well, for one thing, Walmart has one of the worst ratings in terms of how they treat their employees. I know people who boycott them and encourage me to do the same. Why would Californians want to encourage a store to treat its employees poorly? Why would they want to pay when the full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their bennies, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans (I'm assuming; I'm from NY)? Why would they want to pay when the full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their bennies, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans (I'm assuming; I'm from NY)? Why would they want to pay when the full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their bennies, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans (I'm assuming; I'm from NY)? Why would they want to pay when the full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their bennies, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans? Why would they want to stay around at all when the related stress and worthlessness comes with the anger and worthlessness of being in such an environment so many hours a week? Why would they want to stay around at all?
1200	I work for an insurance company and have seen people lose their lives because they did not have enough or the right type of insurance.
1201	Well, it's certainly not going away anytime soon, is it? Ironically enough, in our ultra-capitalist society, you can give sex away for free, but you can't sell it. Yes, primarily it's for moral reasons. There are arguments about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it currently stands.
1202	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed. However, the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe, but it is not. Those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. Therefore, I oppose it, lest I or someone I know face the fate of the unknown amount of innocent people sentenced to death.
1203	I lost a friend to drugs a year ago, and it was very sad. Drug use in general is psychological, and there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness.
1204	If you get caught later on, you will get fired, and then you will have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history. If you are going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work history so that you can't afford to get fired. Find a short-term job if necessary, and then find a better one. Be reliable, especially at short-term jobs, because you really don't want to lose that reference. Good luck.
1205	I am not sure that is a good idea, but something has to be done because the crime rate is out of control.
1206	Not really, because you didn't fill out an accident report and your work will argue that you did it at home and you have no proof that you did it on the job. If you told anyone that your back was hurting before you left work, they would have to sign an affidavit that you did hurt yourself on the job and risk losing their job too. If you did, it's best to get to the chiropractor and keep your job.
1207	I am not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial Profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit. But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.
1208	If he is a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau and the city for code violations. If he has the cops and law enforcement in his pocket, that is shameful! There is not too much you can do. I would recommend staying away from him if at all possible. A better idea is to contact your local news agency and expose him on national TV. They love to expose people like this. It's good for their ratings and it would cause him to stop (hopefully) or at least lose his business license, etc.
1209	Can they sue you even if they cannot find you? Yes. The court will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are. So, if you do not appear in the suit you do not know about can they win a judgment? Yes. But now they have a judgment in a US court for US money. How will they enforce the judgment? If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the US, they can seize those. But if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought) it will be a nightmare for them to collect the money. It will have to be taken to a foreign court and have it translated. It will just be a mess. So you are probably safe. Not 100% definitely safe but about 87% safe.
1210	Race should not be a factor within a "diverse" community. Everyone is unique because of their race.
1211	Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win. You will never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there is some innovative idea out there that could change the world, if only it had the proper funding.
1212	I believe there is a stigma in society toward marijuana despite the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable. In fact, many scientists believe caffeine and maybe even sugar are more dangerous than marijuana.
1213	I understand the point of having someone to hold accountable in the case of spreading disinformation. That is a great point. I guess I asked the wrong question though because obviously, statistically, there will be more lies seen online than in publications just because it's easier to spread. Thank you for the posts.
1214	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but it doesn't matter. That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said, I don't want to see statistics about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positions of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how they are actually discriminated against.
1215	I am aware that there is room for interpretation but I think the world would be a better place if people made their own moral decisions instead of being prescribed them by their religion.
1216	My vote is for PROMOTING COMPLEX SELF-ORGANIZING MATTER as our ultimate purpose.
1217	I am well aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting should not be. Am I correct in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly biased against them? Because of this, I feel like I am closing my mind to a lot of good, right-suppoted ideas. Fox News has singlehandedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which I do not like.
1218	I would like to begin by saying I am generally positive. However, there are times when I feel as though the world is just one small step away from a global disaster. Please help me change my mind.
1219	College is a place where you can build important social skills and promote self discovery and development. Social interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities, and sororities is an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age. Going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. As such, graduates, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went a more traditional 4 year university.
1220	If there is high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would there be an influx of more cheap labor? Swelling the ranks of labor when the labor market does not grow just creates more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least.
1221	If the government seeks to deprive me of the means to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then the burden of responsibility to protect me falls on the government.
1222	The usual argument is that anything that can be invented needs to come from previous knowledge. However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental.
1223	I think the killing of the palestinians in Israel is taking the form of genocide. The casualties on the side of the palistinians massively outnumber the ones on the side of the Israelis. It starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from Palistina. If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly killing them.
1224	I understand that tattoos and piercings are not for mature people, but I do not think that showing them at work is a problem.
1225	It is like having the freedom to use whatever perpetual motion machine you prefer, because those are not real, guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful. Worse, it subtly legitimizes it.
1226	I keep hearing about this as a hot button issue in the media. I feel that having to present a photo ID to prove you are the person you claim to be voting, and to prove you are in fact of legal voting age is a fair requirement. Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for (car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling on an airplane, etc.) requires ID, so why not something as important as voting? There are even some that call it discriminatory even going as far as comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crowe laws. I feel that it only discriminates against people who have bad priorities.
1227	I don't see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like "am." It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00 PM).
1228	I honestly think that Fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation and its people if it is done correctly with a great leader such as FDR. Of course it doesn't work with horrible people like Hitler or Mussolini, but what about Hideki Tojo? He was a pretty good leader with his people's hopes in front of him, only to make bad choices by supporting the Axis. Though he still knew when it was time to give up and even stopped causing the blood of his people to be shed after seeing the destruction of the Atomic Bomb.
1229	There should be no laws regulating how we choose to clothe ourselves or where we engage in consenting activities, so long as we are legally allowed to be there.
1230	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employee** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employee** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then." **This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc.**
1231	Do you agree or disagree, and why?
1232	I would have to vote for Thoughtprocess's mother. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the more he is challenged. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o) Anyway, back to the subject at home. TP's mother (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk.
1233	I am not retarded, but I am a very athletic 17 year old who recently joined the army reserves. I am a straight A student who might occasionally receive a B+. I am not a lazy fat ass. Thank you very much.
1234	The Dark Knight is a grand epic, but Year One is more of a crime comic than a superhero tale, where Batman fights dirty cops and the mob with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli's realistic art matches the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less revenge driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they should have made more than four issues.
1235	I think we should. Consider this. If there were terrorists in our homeland, would you not want help? It is the same for Darfur. They want help, but they are not getting it. Also, if we lend a helping hand, it will put a good word for the United States.
1236	I can easily guarantee that most people who say this have a weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Furthermore, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not yet finished his term. People fail to look at history objectively and only assess it in the context of their own generation. I am not a fan of Obama at all, but I can reassure you, we have had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse than Obama is.
1237	If you were rich you could live at whatever standard you chose, go on vacation, feed your interests and hobbies, and live whatever life you wanted. If that didn't work for you, you could give a lot of money to the poor, and people would like you anyway.
1238	I think the consequences are fine. People having to register as sex offenders, serving jail time, paying fines, etc., were created for actual pedophiles. If teens and younger people who so-called "don't deserve it" are being subjected to this, they do deserve it, because they choose to act like these criminals, and they need to be taught a lesson. Things are being taken for granted too much within this generation.
1239	I believe that killing innocent children should be illegal. If you know you cannot support your child then you should put it up for adoption.
1240	As a brief introduction to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it.
1241	There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
1242	Opera is great. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the least recognition.
1243	"Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious "war" in history." The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same *number* of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war.
1244	Who is to say that teens cannot fall in love? At least for a period of time.
1245	I do not know the story, I am not familiar with the details, I do not know what constituted the slap, how heavy the slap was, or to what part of the body. There is a lot of information here I am missing, but I truly do believe that to turn one's back on a hostile situation like that and note that it is the domain of policing or child protective services deprives us a little bit of our humanity.
1246	We have to accept that steroids were common in Major League Baseball for 20 years starting in about 1985. Will some of baseball's records be broken and changed because of this? Probably. But it is crazy to let one person into the Hall of Fame because we 'don't think' they took steroids, but prevent another from entering because "we think" they did.
1247	This debate has no moral value. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality between men and women. Women choose who they would like to raise children. If the mother is mentally unstable, then who is she to raise children with?
1248	I still love the food, but I stopped going there because of the service. I went there today with a small group and the place was not busy at 1pm. The waitresses were rude and kept acting like we were an inconvenience. I still over tipped because it was a holiday.
1249	This place is terrible. We walked in and no one acknowledged us for over five minutes. The employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally they told us it would be a 10 minute wait. We waited a few minutes and then they said it would be a 15 minute wait. There were plenty of seats open too.
1250	I love this place. It is next to Gen and Hwaro. We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. The beef brisket is good too. There are a lot of sides and the steamed egg is always good when it is cooled down. I wish they had gyoza or other appetizers but overall, I will keep coming back here.
1251	After a year I have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. I have tried many different foods and always find them to be my favorite compared to anywhere else. I have had nice conversations with Steven (hope it's the right spelling) and he wants to open a store in Peterborough so I can enjoy the food more often.
1252	I was not disappointed by the reviews about this place but I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the service.
1253	We had a wonderful time here. Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington was a great choice.
1254	We went to Tim Horton's for breakfast and had heard good things. However, we were not able to find the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. The coffee was so hot that you could not hold it more than 10 seconds. We were already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.
1255	I think it is bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look unattractive and you cannot express yourself enough. Band school uniform is fine.
1256	I do not like FF, it is better for my needs in every way.
1257	It all depends. For example, if she killed someone who deserved it, it would still be scary to sleep with them. Therefore, this is a possibly or possibly not a sure thing.
1258	No, I cannot imagine turning on my spouse in that manner. I know if I were to do such a thing, she would be right next to me without speaking a word. Additionally, if she were to kill someone, it would be for a good reason.
1259	Books are better than television because it is cheaper to buy a book compared to buying a television. You also have to buy a television license. Books can help you learn a lot of things that TV does not teach.
1260	Books will always be great, no matter what new technological developments emerge. They have a fixed place in every human's heart.
1261	I strongly believe that India cannot lead. You people talk about the 7th, 3rd, 2nd rank of India in area defense and arable land respectively but here we are talking about the supreme power we cannot rely on 2nd or 3rd rank. Furthermore, people are lazy and do not have the time to think about the country's development. They are happy at their home.
1262	Well, India is finding difficulty in managing itself first, so there's no question of leading the world so far. However, if we compare it with the present situation, we can see that almost 90% of India is illiterate.
1263	India has the potential to lead because it has the second largest man power and the third largest army in the world. It is a country full of hopes and aspirations and we are proud to be Indians.
1264	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that knowing your father is there is enough, but to me, having a father who does nothing is an absence. He knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather he never exist than come in and out of my life.
1265	I think it would be better without a father. I have never had a father in my life, and I think that if you have a lousy father, you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their children, not just laziness.
1266	I would rather have a Father who would pay attention to me and actually support me.
1267	You should research Farquhar. He did not do anything to help Singapore while Raffles was away. Instead, he created a big mess and allowed things like vice, crimes, and gambling dens to continue.
1268	In the past, children could roam around as they pleased. Now, however, there are child pornographers and sexual predators online. This has opened the door to new crimes.
1269	Even though humans have sexual desires, it does not mean that people you do not know should watch pornographic content.
1270	I apologize, I meant the creationist version of evolution.
1271	I can prove to you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history.
1272	That does not make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys are not? Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? If it happened billions of years ago then why is it not happening today? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
1273	You attend school with me and are 14 years old.
1274	People are sitting all day playing video games when they need exercise. People who are obese go outside and play football or something, while people who are not obese stop playing video games and get their energy back.
1275	I think we should have a gym because kids get fat and tubby. It is not okay for kids to get fat and tubby.
1276	Faquhar solved the problems in Singapore using cash from his own pocket. When Singapore was once infested with rats and centipedes, he rewarded the people with coins for every pest they caught. This solved the problem quickly.
1277	The problem was that there were pests like centipedes and rats all over the island. These pests hurt some people and destroyed the food supplies. The problem was that tigers were also a threat to the people here. He solved the problem by giving rewards to those people who killed these pests.
1278	Farquhar ordered his men to go to Malacca and bring some food back. The traders in Singapore also brought some of the necessities back.
1279	It is not yours, nor anyone else's, but the person involved's decision as to whether or not they want an abortion. It is ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.
1280	Hitler's mother wanted to abort him, but it was not a bad thing.
1281	There is no need to argue, since the entire scientific community agrees that evolution happened and is still happening.
1282	Everyone has their own desires and women are degraded by pornography, but it is their choice to choose that career path. If they want to be in that business, it is their choice.
1283	The reason there has been an 85 percent decline in rapes over the last 25 years is because people have easy access to pornography.
1284	It is not the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
1285	Some people say God is against porn, but we will not know that because the bible does not mention porn, nor does it mention it being a sin.
1286	I believe that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason is that it is better to help others than to think about yourself.
1287	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport and everyone has to believe in each other rather than in themselves.
1288	I believe that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because most people tend to look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before looking out for others won't do a lot of good in the long run.
1289	It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want, they will be teased and feel less equal to their peers around them compared to uniforms.
1290	It is a good idea. Children should be equal and not compare clothes. If they see something new from their classmates, they want to buy it even though it is not necessary.
1291	It means you do not have to worry about what you have to wear. It is less awkward when people say you wear school uniforms and you wear mufti.
1292	With uniforms, there will be less of oh you don't wear this and you wear that. Then everyone is wearing the same thing, which looks nicer, and you do not have to spend forever trying to figure out what you are going to wear. And there will be less drama because everyone is wearing the same thing.
1293	I believe that it is better to have a lious father than no father because growing up without a lious father would have a major impact on your childhood. Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also, growing up without a lious father would mean you cannot prove to your father that there is greatness in him.
1294	I like television because you can watch pornography with your family.
1295	TV can be better than books because it shows characters' faces and action, which is hard to decipher from a book.
1296	I love the television, but you get more information than you think in it. Examples include news, baseball, Spongebob, etc.
1297	TV is better than books because you can watch TV in one sitting, whereas books take a whole day to read.
1298	I recommend that you watch television. It is great to watch anything.
1299	The American water companies are Aquafina, Pepsi, Dasani, and Nestle.
1300	Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake in this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day and it is helping the economy come out of this recession.
1301	Why are you arguing about a US decision while you are in Canada?
1302	Yes, that is true if they continue to manage the positive and effective economic agenda. The first thing they need is to promote their economic policies to all investors and their tourism. Regards, Jerwin "consultant of poster printing san francisco."
1303	India's international institutes like Nalanda where students from various countries came to study. It was the discovery of decimal and 0
1304	Indian culture and languages were established centuries ago, while other countries are now discovering their languages.
1305	The NDG has always been powerful. Why are you forgetting about its ancient glory history?
1306	I believe India has the power to lead the world.
1307	I am sad to see the way this turned out. With not so little respect and so much spam. I choose atheism over Christianity because there is not enough evidence to soothe my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
1308	I have yet to see one logical reason to believe in Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence against the contrary. Once you have discredited all evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity using empirical fact (or a solid priori argument). Once you have done this, disprove all logical arguments against Christianity. Until such a time as you have done all of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible crap.
1309	Science has proven that there is no god. It was an excuse made so people from simpler times did not have to think too hard on the big questions.
1310	No war has ever been waged in the name of atheism.
1311	I strongly agree that spanking children is an effective way to discipline them, as it is painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
1312	Yes, they need to learn so that they remember that if they do something wrong, they will get hit.
1313	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. It is like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and children. It may do its job, but abuse is never good.
1314	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What harm does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ is a better example than any atheist. For an ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.
1315	I do not believe in Christianity or atheism. I am a Muslim, that is the best religion.
1316	All this debate proves is that the internet is full of atheists who are totally bigoted and intolerant of other people's beliefs and can't leave people alone to worship or not worship as they chose.
1317	Science has proven the existence of God, but it is only a question of which one.
1318	I support the underdog. The membership of atheists here is much larger.
1319	Christianity does offer hope in the world.
1320	God helps those who help themselves. So I will go and heal myself on school laptops, then will God help me?
1321	Spanking should never be the answer. It should be the last option.
1322	If the child is young, they do not know what is wrong and what is right. The parent needs to teach the child from what is wrong and what is right.
1323	I do not believe it should be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not a solution, because it hurts the child emotionally as well as physically. Children would not learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They would not do the wrong action again next time, not because they have learned their lesson, but because they are scared of their parents hitting them.
1324	No child should be hit. There are different punishments you can give your child.
1325	I would not love a murderer.
1326	I am all about the no snitching rule, but when it comes to murder, I don't think that it should be done. In fact, I would turn my wife in if she killed someone.
1327	I have always been pro-life and I do believe that abortion should be illegal.
1328	No one has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid yourself of moves away at the first sign of pain without you feeling it, then that is no longer yours since it feels outside your own.
1329	Gays are human beings and should have the same rights as we do.
1330	I think that the egg and spoon race is a bad idea. And maybe we should have the royal family breed some more uinterbred children to participate in the war. Imagine what it would be like if there were no ewapons.
1331	I do not think it is at all charitable of you to donate your old clothes that you no longer want and then expect to receive financial compensation in return. Do you even know the meaning of charitable? Perhaps you could sell the clothes to some homeless people who can make money from begging.
1332	A good proposal for an amendment to the Constitution would be to change the requirements to be president. You would still have to be 35 years old and be a resident of the United States for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part. Instead of being a natural-born citizen make it be a United States citizen for 40 years. This way people whose parents move here when they are kids; these would be the only ways that they know and know as much as any other kid here. I think this would be a grand topic to talk about in your paper and could easily be elaborated on with examples. Remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
1333	If a citizen commits attempted murder, he goes to jail after the investigation has been completed and probable cause has been found. Additionally, he does get bail for an attempted murder charge. However, people also get bail in murder cases, so I am not sure where you are going with that. If an officer gets in a shooting on-duty, he was probably faced with a direct threat to his life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed. It seems you want to convict the police before all of the facts are investigated. Remember, innocent unitl proven guilty.
1334	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor. This is a good thing as it allows you to invest the money instead of letting it sit in your bank account. If this is a testament, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor. Apart from investing, what the person wants to do with the money is up to them. There really isn't any other steps to worry about.
1335	If you are serious about donating, consider donating to a worthy cause. A young family struggling to make it and going to work everyday. An elderly person living on social security and can't afford their electric bill. There are many things you can do with it. I hope you find what you are looking for.
1336	If he does not already have a competent attorney, you need to hire one immediately. These types of cases can be especially complicated, as there is more at stake than you may realize. For instance, a conviction on a drug charge may mean reduced or little eligibility for federal student aid in college. Although it is against the law to give anyone a drug that is not prescribed for him, there is always grounds to review this with the prosecuting authority. I recommend you contact a skilled criminal defense attorney in your area. Be prepared to pay a sizeable retainer. For a referral to a criminal defense attorney, contact your local or state bar association.
1337	If it says that there is a mandatory court appearance, then you need to go. I would not listen to the cop. If it is printed on the ticket that you need to appear, just pay the fine or whatever it says on the ticket. Or, ask your husband. He may know the city's counsel and can get you out of this whole thing.
1338	Prostitution should be legalized, let local governments decide if they want it or not, and deal with it either through ordinances or zoning laws. The same is true for drugs. Decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades. There is no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.
1339	He is doing exactly as he should. These cases can cost a firm a fortune to pursue and he needs to make sure that taking this case on is a good financial decision. He cannot do that without an informed opinion on the facts involved. What more are you expecting him to tell you? He will either agree to represent you or decline based upon the others opinion weighed against his risk factors. And even if he declines to represent you, it does not necessarily mean that your case isn't worth pursuing in general. It just means that it isn't worth it to him. If he feels that you have no case period, he will also tell you that.
1340	If that person was under oath and was "giving himself in", I'm sure that they would accommodate the person. Seeing as how you said that there was a court involved, they would certainly ask the bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served. It would be a time-consuming process as are all arrests, but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime, especially murder, then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork. Anybody who would testify in court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow.
1341	We are required to pay income taxes. We actually overpay each year, and then in the Spring we receive a partial refund. That is always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas or to do a home improvement project. However, many Americans end up having to pay in even more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year.
1342	Even if there arent any minors, the language you use should attract the people and not distract them. There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep'I dont care'attitude. They think that you cannot catch them. They do not even care to see your reaction. They do not wait for one. They know well that their answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care? Just vomit and earn few points. Moreover it takes some brains to answer a question which they dont have. Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in their approach. Come on...'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term. The ethics, values etc are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. You have plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one cant find them and starts using fowl language. Therefore I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and keep on sharing your knowledge with us. I hope to hear from you soon.
1343	Is it legal to push your religion on those that do not believe in it?!?!?! I think that answers your question. Better yet, if it was Islam they were pushing in school, would you want your child present? Not only is it moral to remove religion from schools, it should be mandatory. Children are in school to learn, not pray, not to learn about God. God cannot get you a job or pay your bills. If you insist on God being present in schools, send your children to the seminary for an education.
1344	Well, strike the third answer down, dude. False imprisonment is something that happens more than you think, especially in states that do not have discovery laws. In my opinion, they do not have those laws for the simple reason they want to be able to manipulate the poor and innocent and "falsely imprison" them. The southern states are real good about that. As long as there is no discoverly, the prosecution can hide facts that downright prove the charged person is innocent. And yes, they knowingly do this just to embellish their conviction record to help further their careers down the road. The part that kills me is not only are these low lifes still able to sleep but, the Law lets them get away with it and when it is, (usually)discovered, there is nothing the innocent person can do to get back the freedom that was taken from him.
1345	Your odds are not good getting beyond his limits. Your attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case you would have to go after him for garnishments, etc. If he does not own a paid home or other material goods, the attorney probably will not bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance. That will usually cover for uninsured motorists if you carry that coverage but he would have to determine if you could use it since you were not driving at the time. Since you say you have $170000 in medical bills I am guessing you do not have any personal medical insurance either. Your attorney should be able to tell you what to expect to receive after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
1346	It depends. Both are given due to obvious and extreme criminal offenses. However, I would agree that the death penalty should be abolished. I am not talking from a legal point of view, but on a moral level that no one has a right to take another person's life. The punishment should be ''corrective'' and something where the criminal should go through repentance. Entire life in jail, made to rot in jail, or made to work, is better than putting someone to death.
1347	If a criminal has committed a crime against another race or ethnicity, he should not be allowed to vote.
1348	The U.S. cannot afford not to be friendly to China, a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc. So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
1349	You have missed the point. Confidential sources within the Government that leak classified information are not covered by the freedom of the press.
1350	I think it is time for the people of this nation to take our government back. There are many conspiracy theories floating around concerning Bush and a few other members of our government.
1351	Scott Peterson was a typical Caucasian man who killed his wife and hooked up with a psycho who was having an affair while his wife was pregnant. It was a warning sign to others not to lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your wife and hook up with a psycho who was having an affair while your wife was pregnant.
1352	I disagree. The death penalty is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore. It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.
1353	Be careful. If you keep making sense, they will start listening to your phone calls and reading your e-mail.
1354	The concept that people have this *right* is an ethical question and I support the position that all people have this right. However, whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive. India, on the other hand, has domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights including that of information.
1355	I hate the people that got into college with low test scores/gpa just because of their race. And on top of that they get money for being their. Congratulations R.D. You have made me a racist.
1356	Blame the sanitation workers who fought for better wages, benefits, etc. instead of fighting for an education. Blame the unions, and blame the employers for falling for their diatribe. Americans are doing themselves out of jobs.
1357	Marriage is a business, and the license makes it legal. It is there to protect women's interests as far as property is concerned, and for raising children. It is a protection. If you do not plan on staying with someone, or having children, or creating a property community, there is no need for it.
1358	No, any society that values the value of human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include floogging and capital punishment in their justice system.
1359	The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself when it sees fit, on whatever matter might be. I do not see where this would be any different. The idea that the Church is not flawed and is the body of Christ is something that it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since its conception. If it shows flaws, misjudgment, mismanagement, or any other type of flaw, can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections? Yes, I feel that it does exonerate itself.
1360	If you have the right attorney, it can certainly happen.
1361	I have been black all my life and I have listened to my mother and father say it, but I never really used it. Sometimes by mistake if the people that I am with say it a lot, but I ALWAYS correct myself. I hate that word and its use. I think people use it because they are afraid of saying something else and looking "corny".
1362	Annie Red: I am unsure about religion and I am a woman. I have yet to hear a logical reason why abortion should be allowed at any time for any reason other than to save the mother's life. Partial birth abortion is not only murder, it is murder by torture.
1363	Money is not the root of all evil. The root is love. People put money above the Great Spirit (God, Buddha, whatever you call your higher power), before family, friends, and all they care about is getting more money. Greed is the greatest thing in the world.
1364	It depends on the crime. In general, I believe if you are grown enough to commit a serious crime, then you need to spend time in prison.
1365	If you have a lawyer, you should inform him or her immediately. If you do not have a lawyer, you should contact the court to determine if there is a hearing scheduled for Friday. Even though you might not have been served with papers, it would not be a good idea to ignore this situation as others have suggested. For you all, your ex might have gotten someone to falsify a proof of service to show that you were properly served. You might have to request a continuance and prepare for the hearing. If there is a hearing and you do not show up, the court might make an adverse ruling against you that could be difficult to undo.
1366	If Youtube were to take over Twitch, they would help a lot with the servers and so Twitch would run faster. This is just my speculation though. Also, Youtubers could get help with streaming and this would help promote their channel. Youtube could also be catering to a wider audience, thus making it bigger. In the past, I was against some of the things that happened to Youtube, such as the Google+ integration. However, I can't really see many downsides to them taking over Twitch.
1367	The government does have the right idea that teenagers should not be drinking, but in my opinion, nobody who has passed their teenage years should be denied. Obviously, it should not be 18, because that would give easy access to high school kids.
1368	In the UK every few years the government's 'cabinet' has a reshuffle and the minister in charge of education moves job to become minister in charge of transport. Surely it would be more sensible if every few years elections were held where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position?
1369	I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I feel lazy all the time. I have to remind myself that the world humans created does not work that way, that we must work for everything we get. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in 3rd world countries work their whole lives to just survive, but we have grown up on video games and easy high school.
1370	My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat the entire school must pile up in our stadium and wait until police and a bomb squad come. However, a smart terrorist could easily find this out and plant a bomb in said stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to just run to my car (off campus) and escape. It is worth saving my life 100% of the time.
1371	Why are most people okay with this? Are they just ignorant of the mechanism of this political machine?
1372	I do not understand why anybody cares about how parity can best be maintained or enhanced. The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there are a handful of titans ducking it out, not a mediocre field where anybody can win.
1373	I have never had a problem with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the latter of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained in a certain way). The argument is that it's considerate, but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And in a large building or household, the next person to use the toilet could be a male and need to urinate, which he now needs to put the seat up again. Finally, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
1374	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. However, in my opinion, the death penalty is used primarily as a form of retaliation, similar to the use of putting someone's head on a pike. Should we not want as many people as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to the public about what execution in the United States is actually like.
1375	I believe that the public has a right to know about stabbings, robbery, etc., but should not disclose the names of the perpetrators to the public unless it is a matter of security.
1376	At this early stage in the evolution of climate science, we don't know enough to predict what life will be like in 2100, and until that picture becomes more clear, we should be operating under a much more pessimistic M.O.
1377	It is not feminine for men to do it, it is just a way to have morning wood and not have to urinate.
1378	I am a young male who is considering having facial and jaw augmentation. I believe that once I have the procedures done, I will be significantly more attractive and attractive to girls who will approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face and a strong body which I am going to build, will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.
1379	Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that rival the majority of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead.
1380	I have a problem with the "rape culture" thing. We live in a safer time than ever. The odds of being a victim of a violent crime are lower than they have ever been. On the flip side, though, with the power of the internet, we have the ability to hear about every single violent crime that takes place on earth at any given moment. As if rape is something that is hard coded into the Y chromosome.
1381	I am 30 years old, and I think that the military industrial complex used September 11th as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so that the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world.
1382	I am a casual smoker. I usually buy a pack maybe 5 times a year when I am stressed out. Am I fooling myself by rationalizing that American Spirits aren't so bad because they don't have additives? To me, it is just tobacco so it is the harm of smoking which isn't good but there's no FSC or arsenic and all that. It's a decent option when I need to unwind, no?
1383	I have been to four methods of schooling and I understand that some classes are needed but others are not. Schools should not use the same routine for every student. Some students will never be good at certain subjects and never wish to be. For these students, schools should take those classes out of the schedule and replace them with something they plan on having a career in. Also, economics should be in the prime schedule.
1384	Having been through the Illinois Court System, I now know that getting what you want legally is based much more on who you know. It is very much about connections. Connections between prosecutors and defense, defense and judge, etc.. Such is life though. The best way to be successful is to have an advantage over the other guy, in my opinion.
1385	There is no physical continent, but rather a cultural realm. There are some arguments for the Ural Mountains as a barrier if you look at it from a satellite view, but no other continents are divided by a single mountain chain. Continents are divided by vast oceans and seas. Powerful Europeans did not want to be associated with Asia and wanted to be considered their own physical continent.
1386	The impeachment of a president in this state would be disastrous and catastrophic.
1387	You cannot, at least in America, legally tell other people what they can and cannot read, write, or listen to as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, if you are reading, writing, or listening to a direct order to kill someone innocent and intend to follow that order, it is illegal. You certainly have no right to tell people what they view in their own homes away from you and impressionable minds in society.
1388	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient life forms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if it was slower it would still be inferior to us.
1389	I believe Kurt Cobain was murdered because he had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult three times over.
1390	I believe that "That's What She Said" is better because "Yo Mama" is just your mom and (that) has not been around as much as "Yo Mama" but it is as clever. (That's What She Said) goes with everything and can be used for a good laugh every once in a while and it is a joke. Unlike "Yo Mama" is more of an insult to people's acual mothers. There has been a television show on MTV called "Yo Mama" which has major success on MTV and MTV2, but the show is nothing but lots of retarded people making up sencless jokes about each other's mothers and they are all different. But as to where "That's What She said" can be said to everything and anything! And it is alot more entertaining than "Yo Mama."
1391	The US can't do anything with China, they can't stop them from doing anything. You just have to hope the Chinese can talk some sense into them.
1392	It is a kind of oppression to define to people the way they should think and express themselves.
1393	Pascal's wager is not the best argument for the Christian faith. In fact, I would not call it an argument at all. It is logically coherent, but does not provide any good reasons to believe. However, it has persuaded some people to believe. If the Christian faith is true, then it is good gambling to place your eternity in the Christian faith.
1394	Euthanasia should be available to those who would like it. Euthanasia allows the patient to leave this earth on a happy note, for both the patient and their families. Euthanasia can be a way that people in tremendous amounts of pain could go to and be put out of their pain instead of waking up each morning thinking that tomorrow you won't.
1395	Trapper was a pretender, a goofball who got out while the gettin' was good. While he was back in the States starting his private practice, BJ was with Hawkeye until the end. As the war dragged on and Hawk was starting to lose it, did Trapper call to see how they were doing? No, but BJ was delighting his comrades with home films of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over surgery while Hawkeye was seeing chickens on buses.
1396	I have learned from the "convinceme" pro-choice debates that living cells in a mother's womb, though possessing Human DNA that is distinct from the mother, is not human life. The fact that an unborn may have a distinct blood type from the mother, does not mean it is human life. The fact that an unborn may have a distinct blood type from the mother, does not mean it is human life. Do not distinguish between living cells and those that are not living. I wonder if none of those things are human life? (take a pass on sentient being and souls and self awareness and all the other quasi mystic nonesense that science and the law don't concern themselves with) We have reasoned ourselves away while rationalizing the atrocity known as abortion.
1397	I would rather be deaf because they can practically cure deafness with a pretty awesome device.
1398	Debates are based on convincing evidence. However, there is very little evidence supporting creationism, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
1399	The Cold War is over, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, commuist and dictatorship countries. There are many US bases agricultors and companies wanting to trade with Cuba which will help open Cuban society as US business take hold on the island along with increased tourism making contact with Cubans.
1400	I think it is a little much. On top of the religious aspect, I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools. School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accommodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination. So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs. The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any atheistic references either). Furthermore, I think issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
1401	I think the worst problem can be when debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating trivial things, such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion, don't we?
1402	Jon Stewart has a much more sophisticated humour style and tends to cover more important issues. He always has great interviews and the special reporters he has are great too. Stephen relies too much on gimmicky things and has a less sophisticated comedy style. The whole arrogant act he puts on can be irritating and he is generally not as genuinely funny as Stewart.
1403	Yes. Say that you only get your news from "fox news" and no where else. They put on wrong statements such as labeling a congressional republican sexual predator as a democrat and never make a correction. You now believe that the sexual predator was a democrat congressman, your reality has been altered. But that is just a factual reality and can be easily remedied.
1404	I have visited this location four times since it opened, and the staff has always been courteous and polite, the chicken was fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits were perfect, and the dirty rice was excellent. I'll be taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and I am considering picking up a large box of o'bird to share with the teachers.
1405	I was on a business trip in Phoenix and decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The hostess was very unfriendly and seemed to be eager to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell onto the table from the lamp shade overhead. The chips were greasy and the margaritas were straight sugar with very little liquor. The enchiladas were not very good and I was up all night running to the bathroom. You cannot pay me to go back there.
1406	I ordered a ruby burger and was not able to finish it because the staff was not friendly and the food was not very good. I will not be returning to this establishment.
1407	My husband and I came to celebrate his new position. We had excellent service and our food was great.
1408	We had a wonderful pizza from Inizio. The pizza was excellent and the sauce was also very good. We will definitely be back.
1409	This place is not 5 stars, but with a few tweaks, it could be. I hope management is reading these reviews as most people are spot on.
1410	I like Jardin Panos. It is not special, but it is a typical Greek restaurant. The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time. What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse. It is very cute. Like many people in the area, this is more of a summer destination rather than a mid-winter spot.
1411	I am not a homosexual, but all the kids at my high school are trying to get a petition signed for uniforms.
1412	Another reason against school uniforms is that they deprive children of their individuality. The stress of a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.
1413	Kids do not want to wear the same clothes every day. I know I would not like that.
1414	I think that school uniforms are not a good idea. Adults are always telling us to be our best and express who we really are, but we cannot do that while wearing a ridiculous uniform to school.
1415	I do not think it is a good idea to keep restrictions because that is going to make students more hungry for fashion. It is better to feed them than keep them hungry. And once they are away from these restrictions, we will see the other side of them which is way worse with no morals. So allow people to be free with their personalities instead of stopping them.
1416	I would say you are a fanatical zealot fanboy.
1417	It is better than Internet Explorer because it alerts you that it has blocked pop-ups, and it automatically updates the older version to the latest version. Additionally, it downloads very quickly.
1418	Internet Explorer has a lot of memory problems when running multiple tabs. It could spawn multiple SVCHOST.exe instances and use those as blind.
1419	I would advise that spouses of people on this side of the debate, "Do not confide in your spouse and inform them that you killed somebody; they will turn you in. And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!"
1420	While there are benefits to television, I believe books are better for learning as they require more focus.
1421	Television and books are almost the same, the only difference is that you have to move your eyes for books.
1422	When the United States fought the British for independence, they would yell, "The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming." If India ever tried to take over the United States, they would be forced to yell, "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming."
1423	I think it's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I would rather choose no father than having an uncaring and lousy father in my life.
1424	I would rather be "fatherless" than having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example for the rest of the family. Therefore, if I look up at a lousy father, I may become a bad person, but if I had no father, I would set the standards for myself and step up to be the man of the house, especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
1425	I think it is better to not have a lousy father than to have a lousy father.
1426	Farquhar was a subordinate of Raffles who did not sign the treaty with Sultan Hussein.
1427	The Singapore Treaty was signed by Raffles, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong with the commander accompanying the seven ships witnessing the event.
1428	What is it that evolution is true and mankind is not evolving? And how is it (for those of you who have religion), that Adam and Eve were the first human race to walk on this very planet? In Arabic, the name of the tribe of Adam is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of Adam.
1429	I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. However, I'm using Firefox because I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
1430	Children are overweight these days, p.e. helps one and it will help them realize that health is important for their future.
1431	I think it should be mandatory. Kids playing on the streets are often overweight because they eat too much and do not get enough physical exercise.
1432	Farquhar did all the groundwork to improve Singapore, while Raffles only dreamt of what to do.
1433	Without William Farquhar, Singapore would have perished. William was there to govern the country, so Singapore continued to exist while Raffles left to govern another country.
1434	You do not know these women's stories, so you cannot judge what they can or cannot do. Until you have walked a mile in their shoes, then you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other people's opinions on the subject matter.
1435	You can actually see evolution happening. Fruit flies are useful for this experiment since they breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive than the others.
1436	Were we created in a few days or an outcome that was processed throughout billions of years? Which is more realistic? Which is more likely to happen?
1437	It is impossible for evolution to not happen. The weak die, the strong continue to breed. This strengthens the species. Argument over. However, creationism and evolution are not exclusionary. I do not believe in a god simply because of the extremely minute chance of a god (or gods) existing.
1438	I bet you all know that all the people who say that porn is wrong are virgins.
1439	Porn is not wrong. Some people think it is wrong, but it is not. Come on, how would we have children if there was no porn and sex?
1440	Advancing the common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example, there are those who want to help others, but a personal pursuit is only for those who only care about themselves.
1441	I think that advancing the common good is better because it helps the community. However, personal pursuit will be better because I know that if I do not go to college after high school, I will not go at all. Therefore, I would choose my personal pursuit.
1442	I believe it is best advancing towards the common good, but it does not really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only cares about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone has a small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are more important than anyone else in the world.
1443	I think it is good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. It prevents people from showing off material wealth and making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff. However, it can be taken too far. For example, we weren't allowed colored socks, which was ridiculous.
1444	It is good to follow school rules and express emotions, but it is not necessary as we have come to school for learning.
1445	I believe that uniforms are good and should be worn in schools. In this situation you do not have to constantly worry about what you will wear every morning. You will be able to do something important which will help you in your lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes, but it is less costly this way. You do not have to go on shopping trips so frequently.
1446	I think that uniforms are a good idea. They make students equal in terms of wealth and social status. This can prevent envy and jealousy.
1447	Having a lousy father would be better than being fatherless. You can look at his mistakes and avoid them. Also, being fatherless would be hard on you and your mother. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. At least you have your father to lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.
1448	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless.
1449	It is costly, wasteful, and distracts from the important task of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems.
1450	Water bottles are bad because they cause pollution and some people sell water battles that have bacteria in them depending on where they get the water. Water bottles also cost more than tap water and there are hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.
1451	Can people say some points on TV is better than books? At our school we are doing a debate. Can you please help me understand?
1452	Why would ban a product that more than a million people buy when we are in a recession?
1453	When the most interesting man in the world is not drinking Dos Equis, he is drinking bottled water.
1454	I do not know about you guys but water bottles are convenient for me. What happens if I am at the beach on a hot summers day and I am getting dehydrated and my only option for water is the ocean. I have two choices; pass out from the heat and lack of water and waste the rest of my day sick or in the hospital.
1455	The last comment was put on the wrong side.
1456	Of course it is wrong. Why do you think that Aids exists?
1457	Is marriage really just about love? I don't think so. It involves societal norms, legal rights, families, generations, example, commitment, tax breaks, and parental roles.
1458	I think that the original argument the person was trying to make was that unprotected sex can increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission. That might be true, but it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
1459	I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/woman and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them.
1460	Yes, India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states of 28 ways, culture, geographical and language, it can certainly lead the world.
1461	I am a Christian and very religious, but if the description of this argument is the qualifying factor, I will choose Atheism. God is not a Christian.
1462	If God loves everyone, why does he hate homosexuals? The Bible is just a book. Have you ever wondered why the cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "God" look good?
1463	After a spanking, I made sure I never did it again to avoid punishment because the second time is always worse because you were told not to.
1464	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline, but there is a limit to everything.
1465	As this debate has heated up, it is better to conclude that this trend of atheism has not gained that much ground and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
1466	You would rather die believing in a god than not believe and find out he exists.
1467	It is mostly out of anger, and can be for more than what your kid did. For instance, if someone else made them mad, they let it all out on them.
1468	I do not think parents should spank children because there are other ways to teach them how to behave.
1469	It is unnecessary and unrelated to how a child develops into an adult.
1470	Does this make sense? If you steal a candy bar from school, your parents steal your favorite toy. You stole something and were disciplined by getting it stolen. The same thing applies to this. If you hit someone, then you get hit.
1471	I would turn them in because that is crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that must be punished for their crime. I do not care who you are to me or what you mean to me. I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person, they may also go to jail for the crime as well. I am not going to jail.
1472	I would definitely turn myself in if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone. Murder is premeditated and intentional, so you never know if later on they will turn on you.
1473	I would turn in my wife because it was wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident but it was still wrong. The police will find out who killed that person. I do not want her to leave me for a long period of time so I would tell her but I would not.
1474	I do not want to be involved with the murderer or an acomplice. Additionally, if my spouse murdered someone, she would be too crazy for me so I would break up with her.
1475	I would say that I would turn my husband in if he committed murder because I do not want to marry him. Additionally, if he killed someone else, then he may be unstable in his future relationships. Obviously, I am not who I want to spend the rest of my life with.
1476	Sport should not be compulsory. Children get bullied in PE because they are overweight, and others are more unfit. Bullies pick their victims each day in PE. All the guys on the affirmative team are wrong.
1477	I am in school and P.E. makes kids unhappy. A lot of people get sad because they are chosen last. They cannot play. For example, I suck at P.E. class and I hate it. It is not cool. There are many obese adults who did P.E. and did not help in anything.
1478	P.E. should be optional in eighth grade, if students want to participate. However, that time may be better spent studying.
1479	The purpose of this restriction is to reduce the amount of unintelligent jokes so we can maintain the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
1480	It is simply too tiring. That is the reason why physical education should not be compulsory. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
1481	Some children simply cannot take PE. For example, some are already in athletics and are training like crazy.
1482	I am not pleased with the idea to increase the P.E. requirement. First, I think that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. I believe that students have the responsibility to choose whether or not to exercise. Second, I think that there should not be any P.E. requirement in college. According to me, college is a place to train our brains not our bodies.
1483	Personal pursuits are better because it is easier to help yourself than it is to help others. Additionally, not all people want to be helped. A person's needs are more important than others' needs, so you need to focus on your personal pursuits first.
1484	In my opinion, if you are not helping yourself, you cannot help anyone else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, you will just slow you down. Do not get me wrong, helping people is always right. In the long run, if you pursue your dreams and achieve your goals, you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
1485	I believe in personal pursuits. Human nature is for someone to pursue things for themselves, not others.
1486	The person who threw the cup away should not have a leg to stand on unless there was an agreement made between the finder and the person who helped roll the cup rim down. If your neighbor asked for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigarettes, and lottery tickets, do you deserve half the winnings? No, so I would have to say the finder deserves the prize.
1487	You need to try and get the money. The hospital bills can be paid in full by the hospital's billing department. All you need to do is put a statement in writing stating you cannot pay the bill and most hospitals have to clear the account. That is not all but most hospitals will. It is worth it. If you have no means to pay for it, then you do not. My father just passed away and he had not a toilet to use, and I thought once I went to the showing they would try and get me. Well, they did not, because most states (if you look into it more) will grant you so much money to lay them in the ground. My state here in Ohio gave my father $6000.00 for his. They have to do something with the funds for tax write off reasons.
1488	If you do plan to sue, make sure you have receipts for everything. It is not unethical to sue if you are only in it for exact compensation and not greed.
1489	You have the right to ask for sole custody if you feel he is doing more damage than good by being involved in her life. This can be hard to prove, especially if there has never been a court order in place as far as visitation. My opinion, the judge would order specific days for visitation first. If he did not follow the visitation dates, the judge will assume that is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. Again, this may take some time. As for child support, definitely. He will be subject to back child support from the day she was born unless he can prove that he was paying. You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support payment/custody documents. The more information you have about your daughters father the better.
1490	Yes, the effects of "weed" are far less than the effects of alcohol. If it were legal, it would free up a lot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime, and I believe it would cause a lot less people to use harder drugs. Additionally, people who need it for medical reasons would not have to go through all the garbage they need to now for relief!!!
1491	I am not sure I understand the question. However, petitions are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it. However, a petition itself is not an actual "legal document"...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that does not mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing.
1492	No, looking at a naked woman is not against God's law. However, in Matthew, Jesus states that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you had sex with her.
1493	If your father's insurance goes up, you should pay it. It will probably get reviewed in six months. However, the good news is this is just life's lessons learned. You got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. She got a ticket because she was half to blame at least. Lets assume there is a big doctor bill. You are probably insured on your father's policy had you been at fault. Your friend has the problem and he is not insured because he did not list you as a separate driver and he might have to pay out of his pocket. This is his problem, not yours. I do not see this as an ethical problem for you because you are insured.
1494	Wow, that had to hurt you a lot. I cannot imagine the thought that you were holding back someone you loved, but I do not think you are. If he is not worried, I would not either. It sounds like his boss needs to get with the times and realize that homosexuals, interracial couples, lesbians, and most relationships are common. I am sure if he keeps pushing your boyfriend, he will make a decision to find another firm rather than lose you. Good luck.
1495	I attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these statistics. Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up. This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Reagan, mostly). It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution. To really properly analyze these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations. We also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point.
1496	There is no requirement to videotap your FST's. Since most departments do not have in-car cameras, I do not think they "forgot" to tape your FST's. After your license is issued, the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you were not drunk, you should have taken the breathalyser. However, people do not usually make sound decisions when they are drunk.
1497	It sounds like you want to teach this person a lesson. However, those are not good legal grounds for a lawsuit. You will never find an attorney to take this kind of case on contingency. Therefore, if you really want to pursue this, you will have to do it out of pocket, which will be obscenely expensive. If your reputation was not in fact harmed, then I would suggest that you have a talk with the person, their boss, etc. and then let it go.
1498	Do not let them do this. A person listed as "payable on death" has no interest in your account while you are still alive. They just get any assets left WHEN you die, they are not on the hook for any liabilities -- certainly not while you are alive. Let them know you will get a lawyer if they do not change their mind -- and that it will cost them a lot more than $800. Bank stealing money from innocent children? Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.
1499	It is very difficult to get sole custody. You have to prove that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail sounds bad but since she is in jail she cannot be doing anything harmful. In the courts point of view, fighting this will be tough. You would be better off trying to change visitation. Try to get it that it has to be supervised. I would go talk to a lawyer. The first consultation is usually free.
1500	I am sorry to hear of your tragedy. It sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that needs immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesn't help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse. Best wishes.
1501	If you purchased the dog in Florida and you have lived here together or separated for over a year, then the courts in Florida would have jurisdiction over this case. You can retain an attorney to file your claim here in Florida and have her served with papers in California. I do not see a problem with you getting the dog back. Good Luck and Take Care.
1502	I am also for lowering the drinking age back to 18. I am 31, mother of 2 girls, and a health teacher. I would definitely vote it back in.
1503	I do not know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that people that were born south of the USA may speak the same way because Spanish is their native language, so when they move to speak English they may have a similar accent. Culture should not be an excuse to do something wrong. When you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
1504	The only problem with this form of punishment is it does nothing to remove the mental drive of the perpetrator. He will still have the same thoughts. Perhaps a combination of frontal lobotomy and castration will work, but I cannot see any State passing this into law. I am more in favor of the two strikes and your shot method. Bullets are much cheaper than surgery.
1505	Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?
1506	The bad thing about this is that there are still a lot of innocent people that are displaced, looking for jobs, and have no place to call home.
1507	I am not sure, but I think that people lie in court all the time. People are either honest or dishonest. I do not think that swearing to tell the truth will automatically make a dishonest person want to tell the truth. It just means that if they do not tell the truth when they swore to, then it is illegal. And hey, if they are already on trial for something illegal, it is probably not going to bother them if they do something illegal else.
1508	Yes, fight for your rights and do not give him any sex (charge him, just kidding, had to say that in the moment), the most important thing of course is the welfare of the children, and remember, documentation, documentation, I hope you have paperwork on everything that has happened in your life, and witnesses. He has to pay child support no matter what, he is their father and has to support them (like it or not/wage garnishment). And do not question yourself if you need financial help, you do and you deserve it. Good Luck and I hope things work out for you and your children.
1509	I believe that when you get to a point where you cannot move to get something or do something yourself, or have a very hard time doing it, you are too fat. My father weighs 600 pounds and he can't even walk anymore, but it is not a criminal act. No one else can be held responsible for someone eating their way to death because even if someone else is giving them the food, they pretty much have to feed them til they are full or it won't let them rest at all.
1510	If I walk into my home and my only child is lying dead on the floor, and I discover that the killer has just attacked my beautiful wife, he drops his knife and tells me he is going to kill him because I have a gun in my hand, then he will kill me. Why should it be any different if he gets hurt several months later?
1511	This is not an easy question to answer, since in most states, there is no simple answer.
1512	Why don't we just legalize murder, fraud, robbery, and rape? Even though millions of people support the 911 attacks, does that make them right? Crime is crime and people who commit it should be punished.
1513	People these days are too busy to see what is going on in the world. I do not know everything, but I think people are just stupid to just watch what Bushy (please do not sue me because I just said "Bushy" instead of "Bushy", I just like the name "Bushy") is doing. Also, people are sometimes too poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper, or they are just too lazy too.
1514	It grates on the hearts and minds of the families of the victim that their loved one will never get another holiday, another birthday or even just one more day, with their murderer still alive. It is a measure of relief to families.
1515	This type of question only reinforces the view of anti-gunners about how they view legal gun owners. Your question should be, "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?" or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?" See how that's more diplomatic and more inviting to a intelligent discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hositlity and open biases into it?
1516	You can do a few things: 1. Do not cover his hatemongering on the daily news. 2. If you are at a funeral or event where they are present, either tell them how much their actions hurt and offend you, or stand in front of them with your back to them. You have the right to do this from the 1st Amendment, just like they do. 3. Support organizations, such as PFLAG, who work against discrimination, bigotry and homophobia. Support the same causes yourself.
1517	I am still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non smokers have had their non smoking areas with fans, was that not enough? I guess not. People just want to dictate what others do so they can get their way. If a smoker's right were seemingly violated they would and do get their way. How about smoker's rights?
1518	I believe that the entire United Nations was against the war in the first place. Bush made this unnecessary war. It was an unnecessary war. I do agree though, that if all the world helped, the insurgents and terrorists would be eliminated. But that is not going to happen because I believe 90% of the world hates the United States, especially now.
1519	If someone wants to be racist, then let him be a racist. There are worse things a person could be.
1520	If you are asking for yourself, I would say that is pathetic. You want to sue a bar because you were arrested for public intoxication? What did they do to you? Hold you down and pour tequila down your throat and make you turn into a jerk? I would love to sit on that jury one day. I hope you are able to practice some personal responsibility.
1521	I believe that if a person is doing something that affects another person or group negatively, then it should be permissible. The government works for society, not each individual person. We are allowed certain freedoms and to do most things the way we want to, but there are limits on everything. If protecting society by limiting one person's freedom is the best course of action, then the government should have every right to do so.
1522	I am having trouble finding anything positive about this decade. I am grateful that I have food and shelter and a good job, but I find that there isn't a lot to look positively on.
1523	In practical terms, our basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Everything in society, such as wealth, income, education, and so on, is just there to make our lives seem meaningful. They do not exist in the physical world.
1524	I don't understand why people with degrees in historical studies do things like teach younger people or write historical texts. It is all for our enjoyment.
1525	If we stay around here for the next 11-12 years it might end up being a Dodge Charger or a Crown Victoria. It will have a roof-rack shaped like their siren lights, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram-cage on the front and maybe some numbers on the back and maybe the side too. I think writing something close to Police on the side would be too far, but the color will be the same and I will make sure I slap on everything I can. We do not live in a dangerous city/area and we never plan to be anywhere near one, so I do not see him taunting Fuck-The-Police types messing with him. I think he will bring intimidation to every neighborhood he goes to and people will drive carefully and slowly around him. CMV?
1526	I am a college student at the University of Houston. I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm three times now. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drive off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry.
1527	As simple as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched.
1528	I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. But let's take a look at the frontmen. Kurt Cobain is good looking, blonde blue eyed, looks like Hansons uncle Eddie Vedder. Scott Weiland is a very handsome man. Chris Cornell is not so sure...think he is good looking? Ladies? Layne Staley I think he is probably the least but still not ugly. They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen? I mean even outside of grunge, have you seen younger pictures of Michael Stipe?
1529	I watched the Spider-Man movies when he was probably six years old and saw absolutely nothing wrong with them. When I watched them again 10 years later I thought maybe at times Toby could seem a little bit mopey but I do not understand why there is so much aggression toward the actor. He was decent in the great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? People on the internet constantly complain about his various faces. I have only notice the one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please elaborate as much as you can on this subject please and thank you.
1530	I'll add some arguments here, but please do not feel obligated to address them in detail. There are plenty of things I've probably missed/gotten.
1531	I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important. I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person. Then, a famous politician began to spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication. I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong. Thank you.
1532	The Arizona Iced Tea has 24 grams of sugar per 8 ounces of Coca-Cola Classic and 27 grams of sugar per 8 ounces of Pepsi.
1533	I find it puzzling how Special Education students (at least in New York) get one or two teachers that personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. However, many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while Special Education students each have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reform, but if anyone can refute this argument, I'm open to thinking differently.
1534	At the moment they seem to be like petulant kids that are biting the hand that feeds them.
1535	I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. The protesters were praised instead of criticizing them for property destruction. In my opinion, Tesco is acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs who should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I do not see a problem with the spikes if they are done to protect their customer base.
1536	I am generally against the use of the death penalty on moral grounds for practically every reason other than crimes against humanity, as I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I can understand why people here have the opposite opinion, so I am willing to change my mind. I'm hoping to hear something new though, and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.
1537	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes that a woman should have the option of terminating her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one is not advocating abortions. Similarly, one can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice and still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.
1538	I am against pirating content online. Most people seem to think it is harmless since you are stealing from big companies like Fox or EA, but those are just the producers, not the actual companies that created the content and deserve the money they worked their asses off to earn. The Pirate Bay is not trying to hide that it's purpose is to circulate torrented files of copyrighted content. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his involvement in both creating the site and developing methods to make it harder for the site to be taken down is wholly justified.
1539	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "your honor," or "Captain." However, it is my opinion that nobility never deserves to be referred to by their honorifics. Why? (1) Nobility is completely unearned. It is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns their title, a duke does not. (2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society.
1540	It is not that our generation puts money over people, it is just that our generation has learned from its past that people are not forever. People die, people leave, people change, and most importantly, people can't always be there for you. When that happens, all you have is yourSELF and your goals, hobbies, and interests to keep you going.
1541	Opera is great. It has all the best features of the other browsers, but it has the least recognition.
1542	Although I believe both baseball and football are deeply rooted in America's history, I believe baseball has to be America's number one pastime. It is the popularity of baseball in the days of Babe Ruth that all sports strive to achieve. It is with that type of popularity or attention to one specific thing that brings people together. Baseball definitely has to be America's favorite pastime.
1543	I care about it exactly as much as I care about the regular flu. Which is to say, "not at all." As is so often the case, normal precautions such as washing one's hands regularly with non-antibacterial soap, sneezing into tissues or handkerchiefs, and simply staying home when you feel sick would go a long way toward ending this "epidemic."
1544	There is no rational way to argue against that, as it is simply the fact that they issue the statements. However, whether or not they would be bombing, attacking US interests in the Middle East and elsewhere is more easily arguable because of US support for Israel and meddling in Mid-east politics.
1545	I am sorry to say this to all the eagle fans but this season I think I recall that the Eagles won 23-11 or maybe I just can't remember. Also, with Brian Westbrook and Donovan Mcnabb healthy with their helpers like Desean Jackson and Kevin Curtis, the offense will not be stopped. Also, with their dominant defense with people like Asante Samuel and their new additions, it will be like pick paluza with the eagles.
1546	Sadism is the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfill some sort of personal or sexual gratification. In my opinion, this is the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil". However, where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. This is an oxymoron, but if you pursue pain and violence and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (as opposed to assisted suicide). Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
1547	I wonder how it is possible that you think that photosynthesis evolved, something as complex as that process occurred by evolution/accident? It is things like this that make me wonder how we can't all believe in a supreme creator, whether it be God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other god that people choose to worship. It just seems that somebody/someone had to design it all at least in the beginning.
1548	Yes, the fix is in, just like in boxing and wrestling. The same goes for the NFL because of the billions of dollars in gambling money it generates. The same is true for baseball. Let us not forget that all sports are a business first and foremost and entertainment second. WNBA, NASCAR, and the Olympics have allowed sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys. College sports is the biggest revenoo for them too, and unlike so called pro sports, the atheletes get shafted with very little pay and no contracts which is why they are jumping to the pros from high school.
1549	I do not understand the point of buying one box and then having an "Xbox", "Playstation", and "Nintendo" station for it. I do not understand why the three big competitors in this industry would be strapped to one box.
1550	Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education is forced to have fees the people in poverty would not be able to afford it. This would put us in a society where only the wealthy prosper.
1551	Elvis is still popular and popular even though he has died.
1552	The engineering process category in SPICE is more beneficial for designing or assessing processes of typical projects developing software-intensive systems. Additionally, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.
1553	I think it could reasonably happen. Just look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect it has. For instance, when Tianamen Square happened, there was a reaction all over the world. There were not mass riots but there were really strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports. The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these.
1554	Trucks are better than cars because they are more useful and can carry things.
1555	I wish my President would have specified where the 200 or so prisoners were going to go instead of Guantanamo Bay. If he had, pending where they would go, I would be more inclined to agree. However, with the waterboarding incidents that a lot of people call torture, and the whole "Its Cuba's property not ours!" business alone, I think the base should stay open. However, what do I know? I'm only 19 and I've never been to Guantanamo so I don't know the exact happenings of the place. I've never been in the armed forces or personally dealt with terrorists so this opinion of mine isn't based off of much.
1556	I believe it is justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in its scriptures.
1557	I am a newbie at this website, so please be gentle with me. Saga was ahead of its time, that is why it never really took off like Nintendo or Playstation. The Saga Dreamcast was the coolest system ever, and it went cds before any other system. The Gamegear system was also wicked and before its time. I would love to see Saga to make a comeback and bring Sonic back home where he belongs.
1558	I have received three debates in one day criticizing my views on upholding convinceme's seriousness. Convinceme is the sole administrator for this website, so I am able to follow his rules. However, he has left us as a community to make our own decisions. I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community. If he strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it. I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve.
1559	The credit goes to the troops. Yes I know Obama signed off on it, which I guess you can screw up in that respect, but besides that he had no involvement in it.
1560	I do not like the Vegas but I cannot avoid it for work. It's restaurants like Mesa that make it bearable for me.
1561	The food was good but the second waiter we had was a total let down.
1562	I have been to this place a few times and I cannot figure out why it is so popular. The service is slow and the staff is very attractive. The food is not very good. I have had mediocre hummus with pita not cooked enough, a dry bean burger, and a spicy chicken wrap that had no flavor at all.
1563	I was pleasantly surprised to find that my coworkers had raved about this place. The food was decent, the service was satisfactory, and the price was high, but I think it is a chain.
1564	Our food order was lost and after 2 hours, our food finally arrived. However, management was very accommodating and comped our meals. However, the gift cards I was using would not allow them to use the last 10% on each of them. Hence, they stole $30.00 from us. Be careful if you use a gift card.
1565	We experienced the same experience at lunch on a weekday. The staff was all young and did not appear to have any customer experience. Perhaps they need someone older with some customer experience? The food was excellent. The bok choy was outstanding. The chili pepper symbol on the menu was not spicy.
1566	I like fried fish so I gave it a try. It is a cheap meal for sure but not very good. Think frozen fish square on a bun. I got the deluxe which added mayo, lettuce and tomato. No tarter which is incredibly stupid as it may have salvaged the bland sandwich. Especially since they barely put on any mayo. I will not be back.
1567	School uniforms are not a good idea because children will not be able to show their colors.
1568	It is very bad, though I know I will miss the days when I wear a uniform.
1569	I have always maintained that it is a good idea to wear a uniform to school because it looks nice and respectful. It also shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school because I felt like a girl and brought up.
1570	Very persuasive arguments as to why IE is supposed to be a better browser.
1571	I love the skins that come with the Internet Explorer. They allow me to modify my browser and provide spell check as well as other features that I like. I cannot beat them.
1572	I do not like the idea of having separate stylesheets for Internet Explorer.
1573	I would not turn them in because it would be too weird for me to turn them in to the police. I would hope that the police catch them but I would not say anything. I would tell them to turn themselves in.
1574	All television shows are written down as scripts, a form of book, first.
1575	I want to tell you that books are better than TV because they have each and every detail quickly. We get to read books like story books, fairy tales, ghost stories, etc. These books help us in bringing imaginary power in us. In TV, only some points are explained and sometimes we can't remember it easily, but in books, we can remember everything that we have just learned and then read it again.
1576	Having a lousy father does not just leave bumps, scrapes and scars on the outside. The damage goes deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad father isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, but it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unsuitable parent are poisonous.
1577	I would rather be fatherless than have a lousy father because I would not want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It is just how I am.
1578	I think it is better to be without a father because a bad father cannot do anything for the family. Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats his mother. You have no meaning of having a father. He creates violence and terror in the house and you feel ashamed to call him a father.
1579	Before Raffles left Singapore, he left some important plans and policies that were important for the development of the settlement.
1580	The definition of founder was discussed in class that day. The founder was not the person who discovered the place, but he was the key in the development of the place and raffles came to Singapore and established it on a global level. It may have been Farquhar who suggested this to raffles.
1581	Pornography is wrong because it is not good. If it were really good, then it would be wrong.
1582	It is wrong, but it can become an addiction that destroys lives.
1583	Yes, porn is wrong. I mean, film naked girls to publicly distribute it on the internet so jerk off's can jack off to them. If it is not wrong, then try watching it in front of your family, friends, or younger youth. You would feel uncomfortable and you know why? Because common sense and our conscience deep inside us know it is wrong.
1584	What do you see in porn? - sex, what is sex for? - baby making, why should you watch others make children? - pleasure, what causes pleasure? - temptation, what do you do to control temptation? - then do it.
1585	You cannot argue with the theory of creatoinism without getting into an extremely dumb argument. Anyone who believes in creatoinism is arguing with anyone who doesn't can say that God makes them think what they think. Take a hint everyone this argument is morons.
1586	I prefer the browser with better security architecture, as both Firefox and IE are internet facing applications with occasional security issues.
1587	Yes, some children do not understand anything except physical education, especially rich children of rich parents.
1588	Farquar stayed here all the time and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much compared to Farquar.
1589	It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one to develop Singapore to what it is today.
1590	William took the initiative to understand the locals and to communicate with them. He even learned Malay so that it would be easier to converse.
1591	It is not illegal to commit suicide anywhere, but it is not illegal to kill yourself in Oregon. Choosing to abort is a choice that women have to make for themselves and not the government.
1592	I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was that you prove that we are not evolving. I have not once said that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So I say again, back up your claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, not Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
1593	The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. However, there is a lot of evidence to support evolution.
1594	Radiometric dating can be done in many ways. Today there are over 40 different techniques to do it. It is the fact that they are independent, observable, and falsifiable that make it scientifically rigorous.
1595	Pornography kills nobody, but it is profitable source of entertainment for some. Can anybody really tell me what is wrong with it without putting their moral standards into the argument?
1596	I do not feel degraded by porn. If you do not like it, then do not watch it. There are more important jobs in life than to be my personal morality police.
1597	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task, but having a chance to improve the common good only comes around once in a lifetime. You have to consider that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself.
1598	I think it's a good idea so the student doesn't have to worry about what they wear. They'll be more focused with their study so it's more efficient. If others say they can't express themselves, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. And uniform indirectly gives thought to how to dress correctly. If we let them dress their way, they could wear inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. That's not good for their mind.
1599	It is better to have a lousy father because he is not only a provider but also a protector. Almost every father is lousy because he goes out and works without giving much time to his children. Some children grow up without a father and do not remember him.
1600	I say lousy if you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad. However, if pops is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc... Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.
1601	There are direct links between drinking bottled water and certain types of disease, including cancer.
1602	Television is superior due to its wider variety of activities. Some people say that television is incontinent, but now you can watch television on a smart phone, which is very convenient.
1603	A picture is worth a thousand words. TV lets you see and hear a story or information.
1604	Without television, actors/actresses would not have jobs, and you would not know what is happening around the world. Newspapers cannot fit all that in.
1605	Many claim that this is due to European culture, since the continent has had very polluted waters due to agriculture and industry dating back to the Industrial Revolution.
1606	Craig is a hypocrite with bottled water and should not be taken seriously.
1607	It is not bad for the world because after you have finished drinking your bottle of water you can re-use it several times to make new bottles using less plastic. Plastic is also recyclable and can make new objects such as more plastic bottles. It will not be bad for the economy if we figure out how to reuse properly.
1608	The Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together to develop a set of National School Beverage Guidelines. This was prepared to reduce the calories delivered to schools by beverage companies and in return promote healthier school choices for children. A survey was conducted of parents, pediatricians, and family physicians. The highest supported choice for each group was bottled water.
1609	The real issue is, why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it. Then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
1610	Gay marriage is wrong. God created man and woman to live on earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously not.
1611	I think homosexuals are overrated. They are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal awakening. If you homosexuals would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1612	I am a christian and I believe that homosexual marriage is wrong.
1613	I am surprised that people from your country knock their doors in India for gaining peace and getting rid of depression. Why do most of the named firms of the world have the highest number of Indian employees? We are geniuses and we are actually intellectually superior. In the past we have led the world and we will surely lead the world again in the near future.
1614	India has the potential to lead the world. It has natural resources, full of spiritual people, and country with diverse tongues and races. India has the potential to flourish.
1615	You are saying that only India has this, other countries do not have this, do the Americans who seem to be leading the world do not have bad qualities? They eat less and waste more, the amount of food they waste can be utilized for feeding the entire Indian population. It produces more pollution and blames us. What about it?
1616	Intelligence Design is a theory that is based on Christianity masquerading as science, but there is no science behind Intelligence Design.
1617	Religion has caused many wars and prejudices us. It is time to end it.
1618	I believe that it should be used as a last resort. I was a sibling of three who was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined. On the other hand, our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 years old than we were.
1619	Yes, so they can give the children a reason not to do it again.
1620	Yes, because then they will not do what they did in fear of being spanked again. Additionally, there is also a line a parent should not cross.
1621	It is okay for a parent to spank the child if it is not often or if they do not use other things such as a belt.
1622	Atheists rely on proof even though they have none. So if my religion has no proof so that gives your religion proof atheists? It makes no sense. Where atheists have nothing to back themselves up with, when Christians do. And the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a bad idea.
1623	I strongly believe that parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their children. Children will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained respect.
1624	Some kids do not learn by spanking them. Why waste your time on that when you can always take something valuable away from them.
1625	I would kill someone, no matter what. It is not right to kill someone and then say it was a mistake.
1626	I would turn him in because killing someone is wrong for no reason. If he can kill one person, why can't he kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones, so they can rest easy that the person who did it was paying for what he did.
1627	If my husband killed a stranger, I would definitely turn him in. That considers him a psycho, and I am afraid he will kill me as well. However, if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us, then I would consider it.
1628	I would turn my husband in because that is just wrong.
1629	If you kill someone, you should turn yourself in rather than wait for someone else to turn you in. It would be difficult for me to turn myself in, but they committed a horrible crime and should be held accountable.
1630	If a person is raped and ends up having a child, they should have the option of terminating the pregnancy or not. If people are irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions.
1631	Adoption There is absolutely no reason to receive an abortion if you could continue to have a child and then place the child up for adoption. This is a commonly ignored fact in the abortion debate, but I believe it is the best choice.
1632	Statistics show that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the child and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously have not been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
1633	That situation is very rare and can usually be remedied with a contraceptive if the woman seeks medical attention following the assault.
1634	Core classes are more important, children should be more focused on learning, and competitiveness can cause bullying.
1635	Students should start to be responsible for their actions before they are in high school. If they are responsible for a car, then they should be responsible for their health. Tax payers also do not realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play for an entire hour.
1636	If students do not have a physical education class, the obesity rate will increase even more. Physical education reduces heart failure, improves physical fitness, weight reduction, self discipline, and stress reduction.
1637	Why does it matter? If two people love each other to the point where the two marry, should that not follow what the Bible teaches us? All you bible nuts by the way are making me sick.
1638	Just because they are gay does not mean that they do not have a right to be happy. How would you feel if you were denied? We live in a 21st century, and everyone else is allowed to get married, so why should they not?
1639	It might be against the teachings of the bible, but only because a homosexual relationship bears no children. It was also seen to weaken the position of men. Time has changed, it is time to accept.
1640	I believe personal pursuit is better because it is your job to decide what you want to do with your life. You will not always have someone by your side telling you what is right or wrong. It is all on you to reach your goals. It is also a good thing to help others reach their goals.
1641	I believe it is better to do both, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal goals.
1642	Although we have free speech in America, if our speech incites a riot or if it is reasonable to assume that what you say could incite others to do harm or break the law, there can be legal repercussions. However, this rarely happens because it has to be proved that the actions of others were the direct and sole result of the words or actions of another, which can be hard to prove.
1643	If this is true, then you are probably okay. However, it also depends on how you say what you say. If you chose a hurtful way of expressing your thoughts, it could be viewed as an unjustified verbal assault, and depending on the circumstances, that could be actionable.
1644	Prostitutes have been abused growing up at home. They know they can be murdered any time and they still do it. It is an issue of being stuck in a bad life for them.
1645	I think that if Britain were to compensate pruely for war losses, then America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of King's peace. I think there would be a indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today.
1646	I think you may be a Marine. Crimes are crimes, and some can be forgiven with hard work and a change in attitude. I have seen troops grow up and take their duty seriously. You can always choose the right path, just hope it is not too late, like when Tookie Williams chose to change too late.
1647	Since it has been eight months, I doubt you will get anywhere with it. Not only that you have to prove that they knew about the damage, the court does not side on just assumptions. If you buy a used car, take it somewhere and get it looked over if the dealer ship won't allow it, and sign off that there is no damage, then you should seek legal help.
1648	What you describe is sad, and the system we have devised is the best that human beings have come up with so far in the history of the planet. However, they are far from perfect and mistakes happen all the time. What is important is that you never quit. Even while imprisoned, a person can use his or her wits, and study the law and work actively on the appeal. Deadlines are critical. Bad things happen to good people. And life is anything but fair. Instead of focusing on what happened, sometimes all a person can do is look to the future and make the best of every day.
1649	The bill should pass because this is a sovereign country of law and those laws must be respected by all.
1650	It really cannot in a common law jurisdiction. The concept of common law is that decisions made by courts are binding authority on lower courts. Therefore, it can't be illegal for courts to do what they are designed to do. However, civil law systems (such as France and Lousisana) work differently, and there the court holdings are not binding in the same way as under common law.
1651	I always make sure my checks are not printed on rubber because it is just too expensive and not worth it.
1652	It is legal since there is no overtime for salaried employees. However, there is one caveat however, minimum wage law still applies even to salaried employees. So calculate how many hours you work each year then divide your salary by that number. If the result is less than federal minimum wage (5.15) or your state minimum wage (7.63 being the maximum in Washington), or even your local minimum wage (9.50 in Santa Fe), then your employer is in violation of the law.
1653	Web Master has a point. This is unethical and resembles the workings of Stalin during the Cold War. He seems to make bad decisions.
1654	I am writing this because I am a white man, so I am not complaining about the fact that police brutality exists in the U.S.
1655	It is President Clinton and though people are going to say it is just politics, it is the same issue. If it is wrong now it was wrong then.
1656	Yes, and most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it is okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. The whole town knows about it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. We watched the cops pull him over one night and give him a ride home, but how can you fight it?
1657	The death penalty is not revenge, it is the punishment assigned to a person after having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers. This may not be a matter of "revenge" by the state, but might feel like it by the victim's family.
1658	Certainly not, unless you are a licensed real estate broker and you have a written agreement to do so signed by all the beneficiaries of the real estate transaction. As a realtor, you can seek additional commissions as a realtor for services related to the sale of real estate that the beneficiaries expressly consent to in writing or that a court allows on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on such factors as additional time and liability over & above the routine duties of a realtor, not on a percentage of the sale price, which would constitute a commission.
1659	What about my right to live? The best medicine should be available to everyone, but perhaps procedures and treatments arising from stem cell research could be optional.
1660	You should separate from him. He seems to not be able to change or want to change. He was sent to rehab to give him another chance but he messed it up. Additionally, he gets caught driving on a suspended driver's license. If they find out about the driving violation and being kicked out of rehab, he may face some jail time. I highly suggest you separate from him.
1661	The person above is wrong. Property is property. He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and mortgage. His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. The government cannot take it away just because he is here illegally.
1662	If someone has legal ownership of a work, then they are perfectly entitled to grant permission for anyone else to make copies and distribute them. Additionally, many works are either public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement (such as non-commercial use only). These are again not in violation of copyright laws. There are plenty of legal ways that software like limewire can be used. And as long as there are legal uses, and as long as the software maker does not intend or support illegal use, the software itself is not illegal. However, using it to make illegal copies is still illegal.
1663	I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an expired ID from another country and the consulate refused to give him an ID. The DMV refused to give him an ID. We just asked the DMV what we should do. They suggested official school records, you request them and keep them sealed and let the DMV open them. They just want to make sure it was you.
1664	You are either very young or new to this country. If you have money or you are famous, you can buy whatever judgement or law you want enacted. If you are poor, you are just out of luck. Attorneys will not take your case unless it means a lot of money for them.
1665	Conservatives are against any social upheaval or change. They feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society. Moderates agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.
1666	Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison. You have to actually read the stuff you Google before you jump to a conclusion and post an answer here. Although she is listed as the first female to be executed by electrocution, on 3/20/1899. Louisiana has executed several women, the first by electric chair was Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/42. 64 years ago today, good question considering the date today.
1667	I think he has every right to ask the woman to remove her veil because it was not long ago and she was fighting for someone in court.
1668	I do not believe that terrorists should be given equal rights. However, I do believe that terrorists should be treated as humans. If they can't be peaceful, then they should not be allowed to walk the streets. If terrorists can not be reformed, and continue to be destructive, NO government should allow that. Terrorism is costing lives and tax dollars. I would not think it was a bad thing if they were executed for their crimes!
1669	I am not sure, but ask if there is a youth court or teen court system you can go through. Those are systems where teenagers learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. Typically, if you go through teen court, you end up doing community service and the offense does not stay on your record. My one preachy point is that drink if you want to drink, but do not ever drink and drive. It is moronic and inexcusable.
1670	It is not the reaction times, it is the crime itself you are punished for.
1671	The laws need to be changed so that a parent is not able to just throw out the towel on a whim and leave the children with the spouse who is leaving them.
1672	I believe Bushy Bush desecrated an American flag by signing his name to it for a "fan" (I call fans of Bush "traitors"). He is a traitor to this country, and should be tried and condemned as such.
1673	I understand your situation. You should be careful not to confuse other feelings for love. You should try to avoid him. What about the other woman he is with? Has he spoken to her yet? If I were you, I would try to avoid him. I do not know about the law and deformities. I would say no to both questions, but think of the people involved in this tangled web and how your decisions will effect them. It is tough, I know. Good luck.
1674	I think you know what it is and are probably trying to grow it from the way you are speaking. Marijuana seeds do not fly out of birds. Any dumbass knows what MJ looks like just from the leaf. You can get in trouble for cultivation, but not that much if you only have one plant and claim you do not know what it is. They will not believe you anyway. You will not get caught, and your friends are not your friends.
1675	Using illegal drugs is criminal, but a more severe punishment should be imposed on a woman who would subject her child to illegal drugs or alcohol. Sure, I would entertain the idea of institutionalizing the mother until the child is born if she is using illegal drugs. After that, she should go to prison. The problem is, who is going to pay for that? That's right, the taxpayer. Accountability is the number one lacking quality among many Americans today.
1676	Unfortunately, not likely. Even with the new Chief Justice and Associate Justice, it is not likely that the court will alter the existing precident. Hopefully, though, the court will see fit to uphold such things as bans on late-term abortion, will require parental notification for teenagers, and will require these "doctors" to become required reporters of abuse like all other medical professionals.
1677	Why not? People complain it is against God, so those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays. There are religions where a man can have many wives, do you hear anyone complaining? Anyway, marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day. A Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain. Atheists get married. What's the big deal? So all the people who think this is a sin would leave the "sinners" alone, after all isn't it their God's job to judge them? and to "punish" them, do they believe their God gave them "free will" do they not?
1678	I think ADHD and possibly some forms of autism are not a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math science or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be their own unique awesome person, advancing human towards the next step in our history. Please cmv!
1679	Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard. Many self-declared liberals, libertarians, and conservatives rarely listen to each other on how to better society. Liberals see government as the only solution to all of society's ills. Conservatives and Libertarians find government as the mere deterrent to social ills and adhere to free market fundamentalism as holy. It's as if the free market makes everything a Utopia. These differences in dogma often resorts to divisive politics. How is that any different than religious differences?
1680	I am in my 20's, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow. It costs between a third of a million dollars to $800,000 just to transplant my marrow into someone who needs it for free. I would jump at the chance to sell my liver for at least 100k. If I am not allowed to, I should not be allowed to use that as a defense against abortion.
1681	I think the proof is in the pudding. Take something you consider yourself knowledgeable about and look at the news coverage. You'll find that it is partial at best. You'll encounter people who "read an article" related to your field and understand how naive they sound. Journalists can only provide so much context and it's usually never enough to give a layperson a foothold in the subject matter. This is not to say that news isn't valuable. It does mean that if you read the paper every day and gravitate toward the Ukraine stories while having virtually no historical background, having never been to the Ukraine or Russia, never done any research or met people from the cultures involved, you should speak, think and feel with in an extremely humble tone about the subject. In fact, it would be more wise to ask questions than to profess any opinion at all.
1682	I think that stopping at train crossings is much more risky than not stopping at train crossings. I stop because I have a problem with my car and I cannot move at the speed of light.
1683	Lobbying is prohibited. No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are perfectly fine.
1684	I have never kissed a girl, nor asked one out. Part of it is that I know they will say no. I am not an attractive person by any means, I am very fat, and have poor hygiene. And even if they said yes, the relationship would not last longer than a day at most. I consider myself to be a weird dude. I have weird songs on my iPod and I watch weird videos and have no hobbies other than playing video games, browsing the internet, and watching movies. I feel that I am not meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman. I feel that I have to find some meaning in my life beyond passing on my genes.
1685	The Lion King was a very predictable movie, and the characters and songs were not anything more special than any other Disney movie.
1686	I feel that it should be a person's right to choose whether or not to inform the public about their winnings.
1687	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his shit in front of our building this morning.
1688	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur around 2 hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline offering a full refund or changing bookings to a later date. I now have doubts about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy.
1689	I do not understand how Bungie's next game is going to be such a revolutionary game. It looks like Borderlands with a different setting and tone. But otherwise it is a solid looking FPS that focused on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas. How is this so revolutionary?
1690	I am Canadian by birth but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I think this was a good thing and clung onto it myself for a time but discovered I do not need to define myself by a single nationality/nationalities.
1691	I believe that children owe their parents everything because they brought them into this world and gave them life and kept them fed and sheltered and relatively healthy during their childhood. Kids should stay at home (or as close to home as possible) for their entire lives so that in case a parent needs help, the kids can drop what they are doing and help the parents because they owe them their lives.
1692	Men such as me do not have half the balls to make a pass at a woman, let alone the balls to ask a woman on a date. All the things SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about is something that most men do not do. It is a stereotype.
1693	I think the Japanese need to protect themselves a lot better against China. The Chinese are becoming stronger both in their economy and military. I'm sure they have plenty of generals just aching for payback from all the atrocities committed by the Japanese during World War II. And the Japanese won't even acknowledge the genocide. On the other hand, I know Japan is being protected by American forces, but how much can they trust on the US? Would the US go to war with China over Japan? (Or South Korea for that matter?) I think it won't happen, and in a tight spot, they would just choose to abandon those allies.
1694	The purpose of Affirmative Action is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter their background. However, basing this giving on skin color is not in line with that goal. Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a person, but given at birth by parents. Why should this unearned, pre-decided trait determine the scholarship a student receives?
1695	I understand that the Democratic Party collects the most money from PACs. I understand that unions provide a paltry amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital.
1696	I am not sure what the popular view on reddit is about this, but in the real world, I hear arguments from both sides of the political spectrum regarding what the founding fathers would have thought. I do not really think it matters because the founding fathers were not gods who could prepare for any problem or know everything. We live in a different time than the founding fathers, and even if we didn't, it isn't like the founding fathers were infallible. I do not think a view deserves any more merit just because it was one of the founding fathers. I believe political scientists should focus on what would be the best solution to an issue instead of interpreting what the founding fathers would have done.
1697	I have long struggled with this and I would like to hear some strong arguments from the other side. I know the benefits of abortion to society, but I cannot justify them simply because the net gain is positive. That's opening Pandora's box to me.
1698	I want to thank all the people who replied. I do realize that I may not hold the majority view. I should have used the word overweight rather than fat. Humans do require a percentage of body fat to be healthy.
1699	The fossil record shows that ancient clams are in layers below giant land sloths. If all organisms lived at the same time, how did a giant land sloth which moves at 1 mph or less manage to outright and outlive an organism that thrives in water during a global water flood? It seems to me that such a question is preposterous and that the flood never occurred. That evolution's time line is correct.
1700	The reality shows are not realistic, and they influence our children in a negative way.
1701	I am embarassingly ignorant on the status of this project so perhaps some of you kind souls can fill me in. I'm wholly convinced that a useful stipped-down laptop can be manufactured for less than $100. I was always issued this super-handy Asus EEE which cost about $300 USD. I'm also wholly convinced that access to information infrastructure is an essential part of nation-building, but Microsoft Powerpoint is not. (In fact, that inspires a new debate topic!) Perhaps somebody can clarify for me, will these laptops have access to the internet?
1702	Friends come and go, but my family and I have lived together my entire life. They have been the most constant presences in my life. We share the same blood, look alike, and have similar strengths and principles. Even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than any other creatures on this planet.
1703	I am not entirely sure if the creator of this debate had a specific event in mind when they posted this but I am willing to take part regardless. I don't feel I can vote for the "well of course" option. However, I can say that at least 5.3% is stupid for voting for the BNP. Speaking of stupid, there is a capital 'L' in London!
1704	I have never been married but have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw so I will consider it the same thing. As far as sex comes, it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage or long term commitment. It seems when you are new all your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new/different. After a long time having sex with the same person the quanity and quality both began to subside. It seems after a long time it seems like a routine with less experimentation. Same positions, same girl, same everything. I find the excitement of having sex with someone much better, constantly being turned on, not being able to keep your hands off each other.
1705	The man was clearly an Islamic extremist and this was clearly a terrorist attack. Why can we not admit it?
1706	Death should be celebrated as a part of life. The empty space you see is a reminder of what the deceased was to everyone around them. Funerals remind everyone that the deceased will no longer be what they were to their survivors. It is selfish, celebrate the dead, everything about them, remember and be happy.
1707	We are not talking about killing for fun, we are talking about putting the animal out of its misery. Your argument is not relevant. What we are saying is that it is not worth much to put a sick animal through an ordeal just so its mate wont pine for it. With humans, the case is different. Besides the emotional trauma which is much more complex in a human than in an animal, seeing as we r much more complex beings, humans bear a responsibility to those around them, their wives and especially kids who depend on parents not only for food but for education among other numerous things. Reptiles, on the other hand, desert their offspring as soon as the eggs hatch.
1708	I am not sure you can. Since video games and movies are all we have to go on, is it really possible to kill something that is already dead? We do not really know. I think that if something possessed the undead, they would not be able to return to the land of the living.
1709	Yes, and no. Art is art, and that is true. If it is placed in the correct area, i.e. one's neighborhood, nightclub, etc. It is part of the culture and a good thing. However, no, because if it is defacing public buildings, historical sites, bridges in public areas and otherwise beautiful landmarks of the city, it is wrong. Those things are intended to look professional.
1710	Runes were discovered magically after Odin hung from Ygdrassil the world tree for nine days. In his agony and delirium he saw visions of runes on the ground below him. Later they evolved into a kind of writing system The Iranian writing system of today (not sure what its actual name is), the characters look incredible and I think that that writing system is the most beautiful modern writing system to look at.
1711	Animal testing should be allowed until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing.
1712	Absolutely not, because everyone's sense of morality is different. For example, if a pro-choicer was engaged in an abortion debate, the pro-lifer could call them moraless all they wanted but still not change the fact that the pro-choicer has valid points. Indeed, in many cases, morality is extremely subjective and thus saying that someone "lacks morality" is about as valid an argument as "you suck".
1713	Isn't barely helping better than not helping? And if I am going to buy an iPod either way, isn't it better to buy a red one that sends a tiny fraction of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green one that goes better with my wardrobe but doesn't raise money for anyone but Apple? Gestures like those ridiculous Livestrong bracelets are weak, but when it's something you were already going to buy, it is refreshing to have a philanthropic option. The previous options weren't at all philanthropic. If it's no worse and it's not the same, odds are it's a little better.
1714	The maps are too big for Bad Company and MW2 is more intense because you always know what is going to happen.
1715	School uniforms take away the individuality that makes us unique. For example, some people get into fights because of what they wear, but that is just high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we would not notice who is who and we would still get made fun of. I believe that school uniforms are another way for the government to make money.
1716	I found out that if you park at the shopping center in Mandalay Bay you get free valet. It is ridiculous to complain about this.
1717	I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries. The menu is large but it seems to be very chain restaurant-like.
1718	The sushi was excellent and fresh, the service was excellent, and the location in Vegas is perfect for a quick lunch or dinner.
1719	Down South Blvd, right off the road is a really cool little place called Vietnam Grille. Yesterday in Charlotte it was windy and damp and cold, perfect for Pho. We went at lunch time and it was very busy. We ordered some Crispy Spring Rolls and #26 which is the Beef Pho. Spring Rolls were delicious and all the sauces on the side of the table went on to my plate to make a delicious dipping sauce. The soup arrived-Huge Bowl! It was piping hot and delicious. You have to try it. I will be going back again and again!
1720	Our waiter was fine and very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal. I was very disappointed in the food here. It was not very good. The lasagna was horrible. I don't think Chef Bernardee is better. I would not recommend this place.
1721	I love this place. The sandwiches are always quick and the staff is always friendly. However, I do not like that they do not have cheese on them.
1722	I was in the area with four other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for four and when we arrived with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress. She sat us and we sat for ten minutes without any acknowledgement. We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes and then left. I will try again on a busy night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I think our odds of being acknowledged will be greater.
1723	Schools should not create dress codes. On the one hand, uniforms help students focus more on their work, on the other hand, uniforms help with keeping order in a school. However, kids are allowed to have their own creativity.
1724	Another reason to wear a school uniform is that it will always be decent. The uniform will cover all parts of the body that the school does not want the children to show, and the students would not be concerned about what they are wearing.
1725	School uniforms are useless and wasteful once the child leaves school.
1726	There are many reasons why people find FFIE to be unsatisfactory.
1727	The one feature that closed the deal was TABS. I noticed that in version 7 it copied IE.
1728	I do not have an exact yes or no answer to this question, depending on the situation. If it really got out of hand and the police knew it was my man who committed the crime, then yes, I would turn him in. If they know it is him, then it is just a matter of time.
1729	I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. However, it depends on the reason behind his killing someone. It cannot be some random killing because I would turn him in for that. I would think that I would be next to get killed.
1730	It depends on what happened. She would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I could sympathize with her about why she committed murder, then perhaps I could forgive her and not turn her in.
1731	Murder is an unforgivable mistake, but love is not.
1732	If I do that, who will cook and clean the house? Who will have sex with me? I am too old to go back to the dating scene.
1733	I would not turn him in unless he killed more than one because it is not possible that it was an accident more than once. However, if I loved the person enough, I could hide the facts and pretend it never happened.
1734	There is very little that can compare to the world described in books.
1735	Books are cool, while television is not. I think Black Ops is better.
1736	Reading books a lot can help you with spelling. Reading books a lot can help you write better. Reading books teaches you to read, while watching TV does not.
1737	It is better for young kids that have to do school work and it is healthier for their eyes. When kids need to do their homework they need to do more reading than watching television.
1738	I think India is not ready to lead the world for many reasons.
1739	I do not agree. China will dominate, if not the United States will, India will never get the chance to ruin the world.
1740	This debate is ridiculous. They do not. They are practically a 3rd world country.
1741	India does not have the potential to lead the world because the country is full of corruption, corruption in politicians, numerous religions, fight between various religions, and many more.
1742	He has a boss, he has to follow raffles and not go about doing anything else if he is fired.
1743	On 28 January 1819, Raffles came to Singapore and he agreed with the Sultan of Johor on behalf of the British East India Company to use the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post and settlement.
1744	I am sorry, but your name and your speech convinced me that you are my husband.
1745	I think that pornography is not banned in most developed countries because they are facing an aging population.
1746	Porn is wrong, mainly because they are not doing it right. In three years it will be in 3D.
1747	You are just as brainwashed as I am, except you are on the other side.
1748	I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. However, I'm using Firefox because I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
1749	Physical education is not worth the time and should not be taught in schools.
1750	Farquhar set up a small police force to deal with crimes such as robbery and fighting.
1751	Farquar was a man who dealt with everyday problems in Singapore. He also attempted to get to know the people and understand Malaysia, whereas Raffles did not communicate with them.
1752	Your argument does not hold validity since in the cases you mentioned, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness. You will need to find a better answer. I apologize. Try again.
1753	Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by removing the need to illegally abort a child and kill themselves at the same time.
1754	This is a common view of the creationist argument. None of what Sean said has anything to do with science. This is a theological view of the world.
1755	Is pornography wrong? Absolutely not! Everyone has a different definition of morality. If you do not believe in it, then do not look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they enjoy it.
1756	Whether you are doing a good deed for yourself or others, you still affect the people around you. When asking someone why they decide to help, the answer would be, "It feels good to help out."
1757	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run.
1758	Even though your father might not be the best or always there for you, he is still your father. Every father has a connection with their children, which shapes and molds their character and personality. I believe that our parents play a major role in determining who we are, even if they are lousy.
1759	It is better to have a father than not have one.
1760	I would rather have a lousy father than be fatherless, because I would have the tranquility of knowing who my father is rather than spending my whole life wondering who he is.
1761	Water bottle usage is not worth the environmental damage it will cause. These bottles will not start to decompose for another 700 years.
1762	People drink water every day and are oblivious to the fact that they are destroying our own planet.
1763	The high price of bottled water is not the water, it is the cost of packaging, shipping, marketing, retailing and transporting it around the world.
1764	Water bottles are good, but they pollute the land and are not necessary in an emergency.
1765	He won the World Series of Poker using Uno cards.
1766	Plastic can kill many types of fish. For example, there have been 26 pieces of fish found in one single fish. Fish are vital to the environment as a food source for birds which eat bugs during the cycle of life.
1767	Unless the brain is used, no human being can understand any medium, be it television or books. By watching television, people can create a make believe situation and think, "What if they would go left? They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?" Even viewing television requires brains, and we can watch television in the dark, while reading a book requires the lights on, which wastes electricity.
1768	I think TV is more helpful as you can watch and listen to something being explained. For example, if we read about budding or spore formation we have to create an image about that in mind, but when we watch the animation of budding then we could understand better. Some people can't even imagine so T.V. is helpful.
1769	People who are against television keep saying that it causes obesity. I am not going to go for a run and bring a book to read while I am exercising. I think it is much easier to exercise watching television than reading a book. In gyms people do not have books in front of them, instead they have televisions. Studies have shown that television is even more stimulating than books.
1770	I would say it has you relax in case you are tired, but you can also read to relax. Also, have you ever considered how annoying the commercials are?
1771	Marriage evolved for moral and religious reasons, not just because it was approved by the state. To degrade marriage just to accommodate the base desires of gay couples in disguise if a right is simply stupid.
1772	I believe that India is becoming a hub for international trade and investment. India has provided a huge opportunity to enhance trade and investments in sectors such as mechanical and electrical engineering, food processing, automotive, tourism, and banking among others.
1773	Christians are also fun to watch because they waste half of their Sunday going to church.
1774	I do not believe in all religions, but I would rather call myself an atheist than a Christian, because it allows for more logic in my mind.
1775	Ever since recorded history, we have believed in sky spirits, for which no evidence exists at all.
1776	I think you should hit your children if they did something really wrong, like crash your car or steal. That way they will know that they should not do that.
1777	Yes, if they fear getting hit, they will not do it again.
1778	Parents should use spanking only when necessary. If the child does not behave properly after several warnings, then that child deserves a spanking.
1779	I think spanking should be used if it will teach the child in the long run. However, each child responds differently to different punishments. For example, one child may tell them no or ground them, while another child may receive a spanking to teach them right and wrong.
1780	I believe spanking a child is a good option to punish them if nothing else works.
1781	I support this because I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter.
1782	I would also like to point out that atheism predates Christianity, which was wrong to begin with.
1783	Parents should not use spanking as an option to discipline their children. It only makes the child angry rather than letting them know what they have done wrong.
1784	You should talk to the child with love and understanding so that they will understand what they are doing wrong.
1785	I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is crazy, poor, insane, and I am not trying to be her next victim. Murder is illegal and not right.
1786	I understand some people are crazy in love, but that is not my point of view. Taking someone else's life is not the solution or acceptable.
1787	Murder is a crime that cannot be overlooked, sleeping next to a person who has committed this crime makes you as responsible as that person.
1788	There is no excuse for killing a fetus, a baby, a child, or anyone. If a woman was raped, it is not her fault. The woman with the baby should speak for the baby and know that the baby would want to live.
1789	I really dislike PE. I have to run so much and I really don't like it.
1790	P.E. does not help overweight kids. The overweight kids just eat too much and will eventually become normal.
1791	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriage are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, then law should never change. We should revert back to tribals & slavery - why challenge any assumption?
1792	What is wrong with it? If they want to marry, let them. If you were your child or adopted mother/father, you would accept it.
1793	I believe that personal pursuit is the best option because it is human nature to think of oneself first.
1794	Our animal instinct is survival, it is what makes us flinch when we see something approaching us. It makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In today's post modern world, our instincts have changed to keep obtaining money to keep us alive. Times have changed, but our desire to survive above other is still strong.
1795	I have always been interested in pursuing a personal goal of mine, to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned so much about being more responsible and more obedient while trying to achieve this personal goal. I believe that pursuing personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person.
1796	I think that everyone should be less selfish and do things that advance the common good. But, we live in a real world and we are going to do things that benefit us.
1797	I think that personal pursuit is important because you need to help yourself first to accomplish your goals because how can you help someone if you don't help yourself first?
1798	The case would be based on the words of a convict against the words of your neice, her mother, and her grandmother. DA's do not prosecute cases they know they cannot win.
1799	I think that law enforcement should be duly empowered in writing to take the necessary actions, including use of force, to carry out the duties of that job. Additionally, I think that citizens should be more involved in community policing. Neighborhood watch is a great program, but if there were more people out there doing it, there would be less demand for police, etc.
1800	I do not think there are any victimless crimes, by definition.
1801	I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious life threatening conditions, because the quality is supposedly questionable. However, for other drugs I would do it if I did not live so close to Mexico (where I can just go over the border and buy cheap prescription meds).
1802	Although the previous answers are correct, I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and do not pay him. He sounds like a rogue, and if he is a crook, you will not be seeing the whole amount of your deposit back. You are moving out at the end of December anyway, and he has no power to just throw you out. He would have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal procedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc.). So, I say sod him!! Good luck x
1803	I went to Prague and they are a lot less tight about sex in general. The local bar had strippers and you could have an escort turn up at your door within minutes if you wanted to. I do not think that is true though, they are not that bad, I found it a bit seedy, but I am not into that kind of thing being a girl.
1804	You are correct that it is a matter of belief. It is a philosophy of life (and death?) that is ingrained in us generally as children. Sometimes our parents teaching does not take effect, or like a child, we decide the rules our parents set down for us are not for us. At other times, our parents do not teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and rules are made (hopefully for the good). Sometimes, those in authority get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler. Legislators try to take the middle path. And who knows better than our legislators on how to straddle the fence?
1805	I agree, the government already grows it and distributes it to terminally ill patients, and they can tax it to bring this country out of the defisant. Besides, how many people die from pot related accidents, none are doing 10 miles an hour. You can't kill no one at 10 miles an hour. Besides, Canada has a man named Mark Emery, named the (Prince of pot) he has brung the country of Canada some much in come by selling pot seeds that they have no debt. Plus, the U.S.A. would not have as many drug related crimes, and if it would help sick people to ease the pain, then I'm all for it. With the pain Busch and our government put the American people through, we need something to help us cope.
1806	I lost my brother due to an accident involving a gun, and knowing that just anyone nowadays can purchase a firearm without even obtaining a license in some cases makes me cringe. I recently saw a report on the TV news that claims that even owning a fake gun such as the now-famous 'paint-ball guns' can lead to serious violence and even death. In some cases, people were accidentally killed or seriously injured while playing among themselves. In other cases, they were mistakenly shot by police who believed they had pointed a real gun at them.
1807	You should not bother consulting a lawyer on this one. It would cost you too much. This is exactly what small claims is designed for -- someone like you with a case small enough that lawyers should not be involved. Go to court. On the complaint, state the facts of your case and then ask for alternative relief.
1808	I took a look at the statute and it says that the county can seek reimbursement "for any expenses incurred by the county in relation to a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail." The statute is clear that a conviction is required.
1809	If you are interested in the field of law, you should consider becoming an immigration lawyer.
1810	Civil marriage is not religious in any way, shape or form. It is in its very nature controlled by the government and it thus has the right and responsibility to define it. I do not think it should do so in a way that blatantly discriminates against a group like homosexuals, but it is most certainly within the government's prerogative to define marriage.
1811	There are many programs designed for felons to get their life back on track. For example, you may be able to go back to school and get the taxpayers to pay for it. You should contact your local Department of Human Services or Public Services Office to find out more information. Good luck!
1812	I view everything that comes out of the White House as propaganda. There are facts that will never be known and there are too many discrepancies on both sides of the argument to make an informed decision.
1813	It is my belief that it will take a while to eliminate all the terrorists if the same procedure continues.
1814	It is disturbing that so many people are saying your brother could let the police in without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger.
1815	The truth is that there is no "one man one vote" and that has not been since the beginning. It is more obvious now that our government is really about "one dollar one vote." Such is the way of a republic. So save up your money and become one of the haves.. that's the only way to win. Our government has no power. It's a facade.
1816	Why did you accept it in his stance? This isn't like a prize or a package from UPS that you can accept on someone's behalf. A supoena is a very important document sent by the courts, with the specific destination being the person in question, not the person's dog or girlfriend or coworkers. By accepting the slip, you made it easy for the server to nonchalantly say he "served" the document to the destination person, when in fact it was not. To make an analogy, would you have accepted someone's document if it were a lawsuit? Are you that nosy for someone? The fact is, that person can deny that he was served because you have no real authority to give subpeonas. He can say you burned it and he never received it (no signatures that he himself received anything), and you could be in deep water for that court offense, including possible jail.
1817	He does not realize that his job is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. He thinks his job is to do a variety of other things. If you watch him speak for long enough, he will tell you what his job is. It usually consists of, "to lead" or "to tell people what I am thinking" or "unite Americans behind my common cause" or some other rubbish. Honestly, he does not know what his job is.
1818	Assuming such value could be reasonable calculated, then I would have no problem with a legislature passing a law like this. It meets the intent of the 5th Amendment Takings Clause, and if the state decides they want towns to behave in a civil manner, that cannot be a bad thing. The only potential downside is the cost of litigation if many people start suing the towns and counties to recover what they think they might have potentially lost, based on what some zoning code did in another part of town.
1819	I believe that it is not morally right to abort. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion. I know that in my heart it is wrong and not an option for me. However, I would much rather have these women who have their mind set on doing it go to a clean sterile facility and not some rusty shack and not their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, etc.
1820	In any event, these are questions you should ask your lawyer. It is his job to help you understand the consequences of accepting any settlement offer. Write down all your questions and then meet with your lawyer and ask him.
1821	It would be thoroughly unfair to force people to pay for things they cannot afford.
1822	It sounds like you need a different attorney and a bail bond agent. First of all this is enough to bring charges against the attorney, the notary, your mother, and you. If you want to correct this situation, I would certainly be the first one to speak with the authorities about this. Deeds are recorded by the state so it will not be difficult to find out what has happened. If I were you, I would take cover.
1823	Your "question" is incoherent and contains mainly opinions stated as fact.
1824	Of course they would if they got in a position where they did not want a child. When a lot of those pro-lifers do get in that situation they will try to say something like, "Oh I'm not like to the other females, because this or that happened, so this is why I'm having an abortion". It is usually okay for them, but their anti-abortion when it is someone else.
1825	What they are talking about is not right. There are current laws on our books that would allow our government to fine that illegal alien $250,000, plus incarceration, then deportation. Additionally, there are laws on our books that prohibit employers from hiring undocumented workers. They all need to follow the current laws.
1826	That depends upon whether the person was sent to a professional in the field where the evaluation took place. In some cases, the judge may send the person for a reevaluation if he or she determines that the person is biased against the evaluation. However, a person cannot be re-evaluated simply to satisfy the wishes of a judge or another person.
1827	You need to confront them privately and tell them to stop. Threaten to tell the whole family if they do not repay what they took. Do not fall for sob stories. What did she need the money for? Gambling, drugs, etc. Then demand that she gets counseling. If this was for a legitimate reason, then you need to be firm but fair.
1828	Marijuana is a simple natural herb that provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many medicinal properties. It is also beneficial for asthma and Alzheimer's patients. The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media, who were profiting from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as part of the tax law, so that no one would realize that they were restricting the use of marijuana.
1829	I do not think separation of church and state said anything about being tax free. If a minister teaches bible, that's one thing, but pastor's like Rod Parsley, who for years has flaunted his political views and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should lose his tax exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he's a millionaire many times over.
1830	The federal government has no delegated power to make laws concerning clothing except in those geographical areas under direct federal control. States and localities have power to make such laws within their jurisdictions. During the last 30 years, the existence of such laws and the application of such laws have significantly loosened.
1831	I do not know. As an American I find it hilarious that the UK keeps pissing away so much money into that royal family thing. Granted, I would not be so amused if I were English, but since I am not, I am not. And let them keep talking about Bush all they want. At least we elected him. What do they call it over there? Divine Right? I am glad my tax dollars do not go to ski trips, drinking binges, designer clothes, torrid love affairs, expensive cars and castles and God only knows what else.
1832	The problem is that until these people have actually been charged and convicted of some crime, they cannot be removed without a supermajority vote of the House.
1833	It is only to assuage our own guilt that they are given a last meal. In reality, we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing with death in retribution. What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising their usage more? It really makes you wonder about the cruelty and the overall lack of compassion in our society.- "You kill someone in the state of Texas, We'll kill you back" Ron White-- Food for Thought
1834	It seems that the fruits of theology are rotten and few; the few theological thinkers that are notable have only produced works of worth under the umbrella of philosophical thought. Theology is third rate philosophy, as it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims. It is less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy because of this presupposition.
1835	I do not think it is worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world. I would rather have a normal life inside the simulation. Of course it could be a terrible and rough life, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world.
1836	I am a heterosexual male, and I can find no reason to condemn it as immoral. Though I do believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the bible is true, so I am unsure about the reasoning behind the act.
1837	Cosleeping should never be encouraged.
1838	I believe businesses should not (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and the armed forces. However, does reaching the arbitrary number of 65 and serving a tougher by nature job entitle you to get a discount at the movies and at a restaurant? Is it just a way to say thanks? Armed forces seem to already get thanks with tax free goods on base.
1839	I believe that not only will this hurt Europe more in the long run, but it will help Russia. Because Putin may use this to rein in his corrupt officials and tax skating billionaires.
1840	I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they would go away and dissolve. I disagree. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I believe we should study extremism more. It pushes people to do the craziest things and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they're right and we as a society are wrong. If we study the extremes, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things.
1841	My father is 28 years older than my mother, who he met when she was 17. I have a half-brother older than my mother as well.
1842	I have read the "Limits to Growth" study written in 1972 and other popular books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and others who were talking about the problems and limits of capitalism and consumer society. Today, I do not hear our leaders in business, media, and heads of corporations discussing any fundamental problems with our system of capitalism. At best, I hear people talking about solving inequality and climate change through innovations in technology and a sound understanding of economics. However, our leaders today are much less open-minded about possible solutions to global problems.
1843	I understand that sour cream is available in a squeezable container. However, it is usually sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to ketchup or mustard. Most of the time, sour cream is used as a topping, which would be much easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm.
1844	I believe teenagers at that age are a danger on the road because they are not able to consistently operate a car safely. Raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use. Car accidents happen all too often and keeping kids off the road will make things safer for them and for the adults that need to use cars.
1845	I do not believe that this is a biased CMV. I feel that saying "Guns don't kill people, People with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people." I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect.
1846	I am not sure why, but I feel that if you make a lot of money doing the worst job on earth, you should be content.
1847	Lately I have been wondering about this. Jimmy Page recently spoke on /r/ledzeppelin and he said he would fail at a 256 kbps bitrate or higher. I like my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold cd's or LP's but my ears probably can't catch much difference. And certainly I hugely love plugging an iPod full of mp3's into my fancy vehicle audio system.
1848	I believe politicians don't have the knowledge and know-how on how to run a country. We have seen over and over again multiple cases of corruption, bankrupcy all over the world, and countries failing to maintain a positive economy. Most of the solutions come from an assembly where politicians reunite and discuss those solutions, but most of the time they fail to implement a good one. In the early 1900s there was a movement called Technocracy movement which wanted to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they running (e.g. education would be run by someone connected to it that has spent a majority of her life studying education). I believe our political system isn't run like it should.
1849	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health were a bigger issue and looked at more closely then the shooting potentially would not have happened.
1850	I have watched the news recently and it seems that the cracks in the EU are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Dissolving the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasing nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war. I hope I am not being too doom and gloom with this post, but I would really like to hear more about what might happen and possibly CMV. Thank you.
1851	Why did the "true" gods of today's religions not see fit to make themselves known to early people in the Mesopotamian region? Wouldn't the Christian God, being jealous, have made himself known earlier than he did? If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wonder around so long worshiping "false gods". Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions?
1852	There are many more needs to be addressed than just communication.
1853	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them content where they are.
1854	The drinking age should be 16. There is strong evidence that casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age.
1855	I caught this forum early, whoot - another colour forum. Well done to the person that made it! Red. I'm guessing you said excite. I never really used to like this color, since when I was little it reminded me of the color of blood/murder. But as I got older, I started to appreciate this color more. Yellow just reminds me of the sun or something.. which makes me happy. But red comes to me as much more striking to look at and possibly, exciting. It is also the color for fire trucks and letter boxes and... rosy cheeks. And... COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1856	I am not one who supports no sex before marriage, but sex before you even really know what it is.
1857	Adam had the choice of doing good or evil. He chose evil and damaged his relationship with God. Now man still has the freedom to do what he wants to do. The problem is that man only wants to rebel and do evil.
1858	I do not understand how humans are different from the rest of the animal world, but I do not understand how this elevates us in any way.
1859	This piece is a call to action in the UK to put a stop to the government's big brother program. London's Westimister Council are further compounding the problem that people don't trust the government and their surveillance of British people by taking away something that most people love and want to keep. Additionally, Banksy has made what was once a boring ugly wall something interesting, engaging and poignant.
1860	A recent survey shows that majority of children see Christmas as gift day or the day where you get anything you want from your parents, which should clearly not be the case in status quo. The meaning of Christmas is supposed to be the birth of Jesus Christ, and when Santa Clause is moved into the picture children and even adults see Santa Clause as the Christmas symbol and it is no longer seen as Jesus. This is like a person's birthday party, where everyone gives attention to a different person instead of the birthday boy/girl, so it is clearly not right.
1861	I agree that legalizing performing enhancing drugs is an obsurd thought. One of the reasons performance enhancing drugs are illegal is that they do harm the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the players health because they are too young to see the consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models to many young kids. Do you want kids walking around pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending they have boobs? This will encourage the use of steroids for younger kids because their favorite athlete is on them.
1862	Japan was fighting in the jungles in smaller bands, and their navy was stopped pretty quickly. Only their loyalty to the Emperor stopped the entire country surrendering a couple of years earlier. Germany on the other hand were one of the world big boys, new military tactics and equipment, new scientific advancements, and an economic power world wide (before the war).
1863	Well, it is a very contentious issue. Much more touchy than most non-Canadians might think. Yet, the French nationalists are not objecting to his performance based on artistic merit, which they would have made a valid point, but on the basis of his nationality. Frankly, I think the best way to celebrate Quebec City's 'birthday' would be to build a huge statue to the father of Canada, General Wolfe, on the plains of Abraham.
1864	This is a difficult decision to make, but I believe Queen is the better option. Pearl Jam is good, but their music is not as good as Queen's.
1865	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. This way, precious tax dollars do not end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people.
1866	Ocarina of Time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT. OoT was one of my first gaming addictions, and the game that got me interested in the Zelda series.
1867	I would consider ending my life if I were suffering early onset Alzheimer's or similar mental decline. The ability to maintain a continuous consciousness is what makes me who I am. At the point where I lose my grip on reality, forget who I am, forget what I am, and believe, then I cease being myself.
1868	The average salary for an American is $32,000. The average salary for a teacher is 53,000. In Wisconsin, the salary is 75,000. 4.5 billion is spent on teacher salaries and 1.6 billion is spent on their insane amount of benefits. I believe that this is a huge amount of money for someone to receive, especially since all mediocre teachers are practically impossible to fire.
1869	Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct? Just because one man has a feeling that all matter warps space-time doesn't make it true. Think about it. Get ready... this is the theory... all matter sucks. literally!
1870	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the world. We have a total of 366 military ships in commision as we speak. And we have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively.
1871	There is no disagreement, but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also, people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests. They are one in the same.
1872	My husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi we had ever had, and he would then add that he had had a lot of sushi.
1873	I own a business on Craig Street and I am sometimes forced to eat the food there. Yesterday was the day. The people were rude and the food I received was not fit for my dog. I would advise you to avoid this place.
1874	I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro without the cheese and it was delicious. The server Alyssa was very helpful and friendly. I will definitely come back to try the other dishes.
1875	Slow service, too expensive, weird chairs with wheels on. I ordered a selection of Sashimi which tasted OK but not worthy of the price tab. Also had a beef noodle dish which was very mediocre, small amount of beef with huge lumps of tofu. Wine was $13 a glass! We ate there for six people and nothing extravagant. Two wines, two beers and $174 before tip. Don't bother.
1876	I have never really had a bad experience with Jack in the Box. I have come here twice and it took me about 15 minutes to get a single jumbo jack last time. It wasn't busy. Today it took me three minutes to get my order. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. Five guys will continue to dominate my business over you because they seem to take less time than you do and they are a walk in burger place.
1877	The atmosphere here was very nice and a good date spot. The menu was a bit confusing because it was in Italian, but the waiter was happy to help. I got the seafood linguine as recommended by the waiter as a popular dish. The food took quite a while to arrive, but we did get free bread with olive oil, but it was quite hard and dry, so I did not really like it. When we got the food, we were quite disappointed by the portion as it was expensive for the small portion we got. We easily demolished the noodles in 5 minutes and felt hungry even after spending around $25. The noodles themselves were very tasty and flavorful, but definitely not worth the price. Overall, I would not come again due to the high price tag and the small portions.
1878	The food was very bland, the selection was small, the salads were wilted, the gravy was congealed, and the "roast beef" was the size of my fist. It was also extremely expensive at $19 on a Tuesday night.
1879	I think school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is a gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wear plain clothes every day, they concerned about the brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior.
1880	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms, students are given the occasional day to remove their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.
1881	When they are young and trying to find themselves, there is no need to get rid of their independence. I vote against this.
1882	I think that school uniforms are a bad idea because it takes a lot of work to clean them and it's a pain when you have to put on a lot of stuff in the morning.
1883	I like this website, but it is not very clear. The worlddebating.com is better.
1884	I can reconfigure Firefox easily to meet my needs as my life changes.
1885	The user-made extensions make it better than the commercially available Firefox.
1886	I would not turn my spouse in. I would simply be like, you told me I had a part in it and we are going to go our separate ways. However, in all honesty, I would not want to know in the first place.
1887	No, I would not tell him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person, or it could have been for self defense. If people come question me about anything, I do not know anything. I have no doubt in my mind that he has my trust and I would not let him down for no reason. Additionally, his secret is safe with me.
1888	I would not turn him in if my husband committed a murder. My feelings would be stronger than the fear of having a bad husband. I am not sure of my exact answer, but I am sure that I could not look at him everyday and act like nothing has happened. I believe that feelings are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
1889	If it was the person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it is definitely not. Although it is a major crime to murder someone, I would not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means I am part of that murder by not saying anything, then that is my choice.
1890	Books are better than television because they have more knowledge than television does.
1891	Well, books are better than television because television makes you eyes bad and kills imagination. Read Television by Roald Dhal and you will know it all.
1892	I think India cannot replace other developed countries like the United States, London, and other countries because most people are not educated here.
1893	I think it is better to not have a lousy father than to have a lousy father.
1894	I believe it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I have friends whose fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish their father was not around. I would think the same thing if my father was like that.
1895	Raffles conceived a town plan to redesign Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and land for government buildings.
1896	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population.
1897	For us to understand God is like your cat or dog trying to understand your income tax report. Evolution and creation go hand in hand.
1898	Was there a historical record of man evolving? I must have missed that.
1899	Our world could be a giant hologram. It is extremely likely that we live in a simulated universe.
1900	I used to use Firefox, but I have limited memory and I like to use more than one program at a time. Firefox takes up too much memory to justify the one or two advantages.
1901	Physical education is rewarding for both students and teachers if taught and encouraged properly and with the right attitude.
1902	How are we supposed to curb childhood obesity if we do not start at a young age?
1903	I think it is a great idea to make physical education mandatory in school because it will help students to become healthy people and reduce their risk of obesity.
1904	Farquhar earned affection and respect from the people. As a result, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left Singapore.
1905	William Farquhar spent more time in Singapore than Raffles, so he had more time to get to know the people there, build trust, and solve problems.
1906	So you are saying that if a woman were to get an abortion right afterward it would be fine?
1907	Ahora en mi querido idioma, lo diré: "Eso a lo que llaman un "bebé, un ser humano" no es más que una planta, menos, me atrevera a decir Lo nico que hace es chupar recursos, al igual que la planta, aunque la plantas nos dan oxgeno. No hayamos nido que sea una vida, pero no puede sentir ni pensar en lo que es lo que suelen decir que hace más a los humanos que a los animales.
1908	It is not about what you choose, it is about who decides.
1909	I choose pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro-life. If I choose pro-life, I have no choice.
1910	The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe.
1911	It is no more wrong than any other form of expression that is used for exploitation.
1912	Pornography is not wrong unless it is sick, such as child, animal, or rape, but other pornography is okay as long as it is viewed in a discreet manner.
1913	Usually my decision in the end is yes or no, or goes both ways. Today, however, it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for the moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it, we all want the world to be a better place, and personal endeavors have gotten us into some not so happy predicaments.
1914	Personally, I believe advancement of the common good is better. I do not really know how to back this up, but I feel that way. I am not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So, if there is something I have to sacrifice personally for the advancement of the common good, I will do it.
1915	Who in the world wants to get rid of Catholic school girl outfits?
1916	School uniform is a great idea because it makes it impossible to hold the race for the fashion among pupils. For example, one pupil is richer than another and they can begin to show off in front of those who are poorer. This action will create a negative atmosphere in the school and can start a row between both pupils. As a rule, it often occurs between the girls, although it is not rare between the boys. School uniform eliminates all conflicts.
1917	I think school uniform is a good idea because there is a gap between the rich and poor. If they wear plain clothes every day, they concerned about the brand and quantity of clothes. Teenagers are sensible so they can feel inferior. Also, school uniform is very expensive, but it is cheap better than plain clothes.
1918	Yes, I believe it is nice to have a school uniform. Each school's uniform signifies its goal. For instance, I wore a white shirt and blue skirt in my school days. The white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships. Additionally, identical uniforms remove the wall of status. It also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class, they all are treated equally under one roof.
1919	A lousy father could teach you more than no one at all. Perhaps he could teach you what not to be like, how not to act, and how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all. He could toughen you up. Also, you will at least know who he was and you will never wonder if your father was a saint or a lousy. You already know.
1920	Plastic bottles are of high quality and in demand by recyclers, but over 80 percent of plastic bottles are thrown away.
1921	I like television. TV is cool and it is great. It is like the sun in the morning is like the cool brisk air on your first day of school. It is like the day you get diagnosed with cancer. It is like the day you realize you wasted your time reading this.
1922	Plastic is good for light weight and durability.
1923	Based on the bible, it is definitely wrong. Marriage is intended for man and woman, it is one way of saying to reproduce.
1924	I am not homosexual. I am married and have a daughter.
1925	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together. However, this idea has been corrupted by society's morals and society.
1926	If everyone had a gay marriage, society as a whole would not benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Therefore, gay marriage cannot be ethical.
1927	India is surrounded by water on three sides, something that most other nations do not have. This is an advantage for India.
1928	India is moving forward and becoming a world power everyday. Concerns shown by other countries say it all. Yes we have some internal problems which country don't have but time is river water and it brings changes. We have the 3rd largest army in the world. We produce most number of doctors and engineers every year (count in your own country). We do not like to compare ourselves with others because we do not believe anyone is stronger or weaker than us.
1929	Christianity is in conflict with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational and impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is more logical.
1930	No one has ever said science is perfect. That is the difference between science and religion. Science admits it doesn't have all the answers, while religion is so dogmatic it doesn't even recognize facts.
1931	The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says. And we wouldn't be wiser.
1932	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice. Therefore, I would spank my children out of love and on the butt.
1933	Yes, because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it hurts. I know this from experience.
1934	I believe that spanking a child only when they know they are wrong is the best way to teach them not to do the same mistake again.
1935	Faith is a key component to Christianity. Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there. Gravity, for example, you can't feel it, feel it, or hear it, but you know it is there.
1936	I love Jesus, so I am on this side.
1937	I assume everyone on this side of this argument was raised in a Christian home. Grow a pair and ask yourself, why do I worship a man who wears scruffy sandals?
1938	Why are we fighting? Right now, those scientologists are running rampant. We need to unite to fight them.
1939	I do not think spanking should be necessary. It would only last a minute, but punishing could last for two or three weeks or more.
1940	No, because if we hit our children, they will think that we do not love them.
1941	I do not think they should be spanked because I do not think it works. Maybe it will once in a while, but as they grow up it is not a good technique to do.
1942	Not all problems begin with violence. Parents should not hit children for discipline unless it is necessary.
1943	I disagree with the use of spaking as an option to discipline children because the children are not going to be scared of what their parents are doing to them. Additionally, if you do that to your children, they are learning what their parents show them, and that is not going to help that much.
1944	I would say yes to some circumstances but not to others. I would not turn them in if they killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person out of cold heartedness, for money, objects, or simply a pure dislike of them.
1945	It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse, but it is something you must do for your own safety.
1946	Murder is not right under any circumstances. A person who commits the act knows the consequences and knows that they are guilty. I would not be able to look at my spouse the same again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. I would turn them in.
1947	We did not create the child, we are not the ones who gave it life, why should we be the ones who put it to death? We have no authority to do such a thing.
1948	Reagan once said, "I choose life." You may notice that everyone who is pro-choice has been born.
1949	We should all be fine with it, as long as it is not disease.
1950	Does the Declaration of Independence say that we have the right to life, liberty and happiness?
1951	Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you might have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal.
1952	It is better to help yourself first, than to help others. For instance, if you are not in a stable situation, how are you going to help someone else? If you are still living at home with your mother and you do not have a job, you cannot help yourself.
1953	It is easier to get most people to pursue personal pursuits than it is to get most people to pursue advancing the common good.
1954	Yes, it is illegal. The consequences are going to be you and your friend going to each house and cleaning it up. Just like when people use toilet paper. A few years ago when I was a minor, my brother and I went around drawing on people's garage doors in chalk. We were caught and had to go around and clean every single garage. Have fun.
1955	When the Nazis came to power, they banned the private possession of firearms. There is a reason for this. When they wanted to shut down the door and carry people away without due process of law, they did not want anyone to be able to fight back.
1956	You have a good question. In our real world, it is much more likely for a poor person to be convicted of a felony than a rich person. Thus, when EX-felons are denied the franchise, poor communities are denied equal representation.
1957	If the landlord does not make the repairs, the tenant can do the following: Take the rent when it is due to the local clerk of courts. The tenant must be current in their rent with the clerk of courts (called rent deposit). The court can order the landlord to make the repairs. The court can also lower the rent until the repairs are made or give the tenant some of the rent money so the tenant can have the repairs made. End the lease or cancel the rental agreement and move.
1958	Although adultery may be against the law where you live, and although you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is mislaced anger. This woman was not coming to your home. She was invited to your home by your husband. He was not having relations with her. And she did not get pregnant. Your husband got her pregnant. This woman did nothing to you. Your husband did. Make sure to divorce him.
1959	It depends on what the contract says. It may call for mutual satisfaction or give you a right to ask for them to be redone. Most likely you have to pay anyway. However, the issue may not be best approached through your "legal recourse." If you have not done so, tell the designer how unhappy you are and why, and ask that the designs be redone. It may be in the designers' best interests to see that their customers are happy with the design.
1960	That is an odd question, because the word was used by certain people precisely as a term of offense to describe'some other people.'
1961	It is due to the large amount of people living in a small area of Manhattan. Most other cities that are more spread out will clean the streets less frequently.
1962	He is an adult, but I assume that you are a minor? First of all, he should not have put you in a criminal situation. Obviously, he did not care enough about you to keep you out of possibly going to jail, so I would just let him sit in there and think about what he has done. If he is a man at all, he should be the one apologizing to you.
1963	I do not think so, not in a civilized society. I guess you are asking this in relation to the impending trial verdict on Saddam Hussein. If he is sentenced to death, there will be further violence, hate and bloodshed. For serious crimes, I think a life sentence in prison is the appropriate punishment. I do not understand how killing someone solves anything.
1964	I believe that the age limit is a common excuse for not being able to drink.
1965	Yes, and they need to be reduced now. The Child Protective Services in my state make an awful mess of families with no real proof of any reason. They do the children more harm than good by ripping them from famlilies with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families, and basically terrorizing everyone, including babies. I have seen many families destroyed, and there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play their God games and bowing low each time.
1966	Regardless of individual court cases, the trick is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist. One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape in which the so called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I do not know of any specific court cases.
1967	Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. But what about the baby? No baby would decide. I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I COULD live outside my mother's body) be stabbed in the skull and have my brain sucked out. How selfish are the women who think it is all about them and what they need or want?
1968	Is it possible? It depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge. Many federal courts require individuals with cell phones, pagers, blackberries, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service. If a judge has a standing policy against such things in his courtroom, whether on or off, you could be held in contempt. However, I've personally seen a person's phone get confiscated b/c there was a concern that the individual was attempting to take photographs of witnesses with it in a drug case (i.e. witness intimidation).
1969	The whole thing sounds pretty dodgy to me. An extension without the proper footings is not legal and if it has been built without planning permission that too is not legal. The letter that you write should not be to help them make a sale on a property that has parts that could fall down in a gale and perhaps cause injury. It should be to state that it had only been built for the time that it has and that the building should be inspected as there are no proper foundations. If you knowingly write an incorrect statement and the truth comes out then you could be caught for aiding and abetting an illegal sale. The whole thing is a mine field so either stay out of it altogether or put the local authority in the picture. The estate agent should also be made aware of the problem as he could be in real trouble.
1970	I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
1971	You cannot export Democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government. Muslim countries do not have the Enlightenment background we had in the nascent United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic. Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran. Despite the attempts by some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience.
1972	My wife was severely abused as a child. We are happy in our marriage and she is an excellent wife and partner. The answer is yes, but it requires patience and understanding.
1973	I have had to deal with custody battles many times in my work and it is never a happy trail.
1974	Please note, there are quite a number of illegal immigrants in our prisons and jails for rape, murder, drug smuggling, and theft. Because they crossed the border illegally, it means that criminals also crossed the border. Without a system, anybody can come in, no matter how diseased or criminal.
1975	It is unethical and against Yahoo!'s rules to vote on your own answer.
1976	The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion should be legal as long as the First Amendment is not altered. It has nothing to do with when life begins, etc., as some would like it to. It is all about this great country's freedoms and constitution giving us protections over our personal self.
1977	I agree that if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless peoples' health and lives. It would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. I do not think that is a loss of money. It would only save lives and money. Besides, the cigarette industry deserves to collapse. I would love to see that day.
1978	I believe the system is now not seperate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice.
1979	You should not have a problem with them if you tell them exactly what you posted here.
1980	I know that in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of whatever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. Why do criminals have it made in this country?
1981	I believe that the main problem with the trust issue is mainly due to the iffy criminal justice system. In order for the system to function it must be swift, severe, and guaranteed. For example, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no punishment. Additionally, you can commit the same crime in two places, one gets probation and the other gets 20 years. I believe that until these issues are resolved, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone. Unfortunately, our justice system is unique in the world, it would literally let 10 guilty people go than send one innocent person to jail.
1982	If you are not injured and treated professionally, your case is weak. If you hire an attorney, it is likely there will not be enough money left to pay the bill for your care.
1983	I have lived in Texas all my life and I have noticed that the media seems to have a large affect on popular opinion. Why they have chosen this time to make it a major issue is beyond anything I can understand.
1984	Legally yes it can and has happened. The reality is that men like sex and if they are not in a relationship they have little incentive to avoid sex. A man weak enough to be "raped" would be a laughing stock.
1985	I heard about this on the news this morning. I believe that he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the child. Whether she says she is on birth control or not using a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe act is not to perform the act.
1986	Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "triple-dog dare," authorities said. The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pairs of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. They will not be prosecuted, authorities said.
1987	If you feel that it is necessary, yes, but are you still going to be able to work and make your own income? These semi truck drivers carry insurance, and some of them carry million dollar insurance, but not all of them go after the company he is driving for. He probably feels guilty about it every day of his life. I am very sorry for your pain. Good Luck.
1988	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts. The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues.
1989	I am moving to Singapore in the coming months and I discovered that they have a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries.
1990	The main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not. To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since it is our brain that makes us sentient. So, if a fetus does not show any signs of brain activity then it is not a living human being and could be legally aborted. This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially making the abort issue much easier to solve.
1991	I believe that if a person commits suicide, they can continue living. It is not necessary for a person to commit suicide, but rather, they have the ability to do so.
1992	I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level so that they are not bored in their classes.
1993	I feel that concepts of right and evil are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years. Because of this there are no objective morals and true 'good' and 'evil' do not exist. I am not going to respond to every reply because there are quite a few of them and I have stuff to do.
1994	If something is important enough to cover on a website, then it should be easily found within the core content of the site and not shoved into an FAQ section.
1995	Especially since it is shunned by everyone if someone other than a dark colored person uses the word. It becomes something that only one race can use and that is racist. If I am being too vague on why I have my opinion feel free to ask me questions. I am very interested in a debate. I am aware that **censorship** is very related to my question and is an **entirely different debate**. I want to know why my opinion that using the word is wrong and **not** about how **implementing a censorship would work**.**
1996	I have never understood this as no one who had a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or an actor from the film was in the audience, but for normal moviegoing circumstances it doesn't make any sense to me. Please change my mind so I can stop getting annoyed when a theatre full of people clap.
1997	The world is a chaotic system, so every single choice you make, even subcobscious ones, come together to create your destiny. The choices you make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child, and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through the butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
1998	Point 1 is that testing is the only effective means of objective measurement and is necessary to evaluate if a system is working properly. Point 2 is that education changes over time and requires ever changing curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life. Point 3 is that teachers must continue to learn these new methods and changing curriculum in order to effectively lead the learning process. Point 4 is that standardized testing prior to each school year would allow teachers to be moved where most effective, or removed all together if they are no longer effective at leading the learning process. Point 5 is that high performing teachers could be paid more if the underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.
1999	I don't think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of a planet with life.
2000	Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to cease-fire without retaliation. * Hamas declines/ignoring these opportunities of peace have left Israel with no options besides retaliation. * Hamas should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles out of civilian buildings.
2001	Since my apartment is lacking an elevator, I keep my bike secured outdoors. I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen as well. I am very angry now. There's no way I'm throwing another 80+ euros to buy a new one at a shop. I also refuse to buy a cheap one which was obviously stolen. It looks like the best option remaining is starting to steal bikes on my own. Why should I not do that? Please provide a better alternative.
2002	With how close the world has come to annihilating itself because of leaders who have been a bit trigger happy, I truly believe nukes are pretty much the only reason the world isn't in major conflict right now.
2003	I often see criticism of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts. In most places, women must cover up their breasts in public because websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images. Even if it is legal, it is often frowned upon by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly. How is this different than preventing women from exposing their faces or legs? I invite you all to CMV.
2004	I have heard the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of having a team named the Detroit N*****s. This is illogical. I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word simply on how the word is used in context.
2005	People who know nothing of it seem to be slightly disdainful towards it. It is seen as being like a form of hooliganism and associated with being immature and has generally bad connotations. However, I consider it a form of street art. If you are more in favor of a corporations right to take up public space with art than you are in favor of people's desire to rebel against that with street art, then fair enough I don't expect to change your mind with this and you won't change mine by saying it's against the law. But if you enjoy street art you should appreciate skateboarding on some level.
2006	I think the behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). In comparison, football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries do not occur, or that fouls should not be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off. Change my view.
2007	I don't think anyone ever 'asks to be raped', but I think if you dress like a whore you increase your chances of being raped. I think dressing more conservatively would reduce that chance. Women are always saying that they should not be treated like sexual objects, but I think that is not true. I have not been convinced.
2008	Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about the perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) consider bad, my mind tends toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say,"Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. Thanks
2009	Gravity is a theory, and should not be taught in schools because it is not absolute. A theory, as science details is not a law, and we should not be teaching our kids speculative notions about the world as fact.
2010	Religion is based on zero evidence and abstract ideas. It attacks the intelligence and mental development of human beings.
2011	We need to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to citizenship.
2012	Not even close. Owen Wilson's Kentucky Fried accent goes in and out throughout the movie, and the death scene in Life Aquatic pales to the suicide scene in Revolver. It helps that the needle in the hay is playing. And the funniest 15 seconds of any Wes movie is the tennis scene.
2013	Married life is about stability for the rest of your life, a partner who loves and adores you so much as to make a lifetime commitment to you, respect from family and friends, and happiness. Single life, on the other hand, is lonely, a level of immatureness, selfishness, ignorance to making a true commitment, stuck in the memory of the 8th grade class dance.
2014	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired, while a chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw. I would go down the block while spinning in a circle of undead carnage. (Although if there are only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
2015	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction. This is not the pretty part, but it is part of the package. And while humans have a moral responsibility to moderate their impact on the natural world, we are doing more right now than any species has before. Would it be "enough" if it offset our impact, which is hardly "natural"? Or are we supposed to save every last species, however unfit?
2016	I guess this sort of depends on what you are listening to. For example, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. I know I am going to get crucified for this, but when I listen to it just with speakers on it really sounds pretty thin and uneasy, while when I put the headphones on I am really seeing the whole vision and scope of a Wallace phycalic epic. But, as I said, it sort of depends on the album.
2017	It is hard to a day go by without a democrat politician complaining about the fact that we have not captured or killed Osama Bin Laden.
2018	It depends on the game genre. For example, I prefer PC gaming for FPS, RTS, MMORPGs, and racing games because I am more accurate with a mouse and keyboard than a controller, and my PC's steering wheel + gadgets make the racing games much more enjoyable than a controller does. However, most other genres seem to benefit from the console controllers, side-scrollers, action RPGs, RPGs, sports, etc.
2019	The execution of a small percentage of those convicted of murder is not the worst offenders but rather the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged showing mistakes had been made.
2020	The issue of muslim integration within Britain is currently a problem. Both sides of the argumentment (christians and muslims) are using the debate as a way to integrate more religious power within the country. This is why the Archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration.
2021	Cats are independent. You do not have to take them everywhere you go and have to watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities because they cannot on their own. They are amazing animals and pets. They are not always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference.
2022	Operation Eagle Claw failed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert causing damage to most of the helicopters attempting rescue of US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran. Carter would easily win re-election and Ray Gun would not have been elected.
2023	This is way too much of a blanket assertion, just being a "dictator" is no reason to dispose of, much less eliminate a so called dictator. Who determines who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees a nation's leader is a dictator, why assaniate him/her? There have been "benign" dictators, but there have also been "non-dictators.
2024	I believe 1984 could be the best because it is the most prophetic. I believe that 1984, like all the best products in the world, fulfills its function beautifully. However, I have to admit that I have not read the other three books on the list and therefore cannot give my opinion.
2025	To all those doubters, you are right, no building in the history of man kind has ever had a steel frame burn to the ground, it must have been that hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that fell, completely unattached to the tower must have imploded onto itself because of the... I forgot what I was saying, what did the Bush administration say again? Because I'm sure that's it. They would never lie to the American public, right?
2026	I am not saying it should be English, but there should be one official language we use to communicate with each other. We would be able to do business much better, understand everyone, and communicate ideas properly. The internet has given us all the ability to communicate with each other, all we need now is a single language.
2027	We have something against non-Christians here? People are voting against me opening my store to appeal to any client that decides there is something they need on Christmas Day.
2028	I found out about Butterblume through Eater Montreal. We arrived at around 1:45 on a Saturday and the place was full. We were able to get a table for five. The food was exceptional. It combines interesting ingredients together as well as different textures and the tastes and flavors are really good.
2029	This place is a dumpy neighborhood bar located in a not-so great strip mall. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as well as the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. The ranch tastes homemade and is very good.
2030	I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and had unlimited access to Rudy's. I loved their brisket and sauce, gas station setup and the fact they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to Phx for 4 years then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes we have Rudy's but they are not nearly as accessible as they are in ATX. I went on a Wkd trip to Phx at the end of July and low and behold what did we drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend had never been there so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately her taste in the sauce was not as good as hers but I loved every second.
2031	I visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered (6) wings and fries and the small wings / fries came in a cardboard box. The meal was over priced for the value. There is also very little room to sit and eat inside. If you are not interested in watching Fox News or listening to talk radio host Larry Elder, this may not be the place for you.
2032	We visited this restaurant last night and were seated on the lovely patio. The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to chat and enjoy the food. The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. My husband and I split everything and it was just enough for dessert.
2033	I understand that Kafein is a bar in the evening, but it does not appear to be a place for students to study during the day. Why play loud music that no one can concentrate on?
2034	Although the food I have here is generally excellent and delicious, I cannot give it a 5. My biggest issue is that it is so hot inside. I was sweating buckets and I've come here at least four times now and it continues to be super hot. Also, the service is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes we get our food super fast and sometimes it gets it super slow. It's weird that gyoza takes that much longer than my noodles. Everything is fresh though, so it's all right.
2035	School uniforms do not help a person in cold weather or in heat, as special clothes do.
2036	The children lose their individuality and it does not feel comfortable.
2037	Firefox is more respectful of W3C internet standards, while soft sucks by trying to force us to use their own standards to keep their monopoly.
2038	You are asked before anything is installed for the browser.
2039	I would still divorce the crazy chick though.
2040	There is no debate if those who have actually read a book.
2041	I am very impressed by your views. From where did you get these unique datas, I kindly request you to submit more pts. like all these please. Please do not mind my words, but all these special datas are accurate? reply me soon!
2042	I have to say just one word: conspiracy.
2043	Kill all the politicians first and India will be developed tomorrow.
2044	India is a poor country with a huge wealth gap and a language that the majority of the world cannot understand. India should leave that to the superpowers.
2045	I believe it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father.
2046	The Singapore Treaty was signed by Raffles, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong with the commander accompanying the seven ships witnessing the event.
2047	Sir Raffles is the rightful founder of Singapore because he increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade and many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
2048	Raffles led the expedition to find a new trading port, and Farquhar only accompanied him. Therefore, even if Farquhar did not come, Raffles would still have founded Singapore.
2049	Without Raffles, Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
2050	Raffles was responsible for Singapore's boost in economy. He increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
2051	God is abstract. He does not often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is hard to think about. Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to grasp.
2052	I think you are referring to a time of more recent Christianity, so creationism has existed in existence much longer than your statement.
2053	Just because you think your opponent has been tricked does not make your argument stronger.
2054	IE is a bad browser. It stole the idea of tabbed browsing from other browsers. You cannot get extensions for it.
2055	I like the little pop up windows, but you cannot get those with Firefox.
2056	Yes, of course. Apart from the health benefits, there is a greater respect for the outdoors, sporting camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation, and so forth. Now drop and give me twenty for your insolence!
2057	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds, while Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
2058	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because he had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is necessary to help Farquhar solve the problems faced by the people.
2059	Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other useful countries for about four years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. This shows that he was a bad developer of the country.
2060	William Farquhar helped more Singaporeans than Raffles did. William Farquhar was more of an innovator in Singapore than Raffles.
2061	Pro-life means that many more crack addicts and poverty ridden children are born.
2062	I do not want to say I officially have a position, but I want someone on the other side to answer this question because I honestly just do not know if a 14 year old is raped, and then becomes pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro-life decision? Is it then pro-life to have an abortion? I do not know.
2063	Would that make your argument weaker?
2064	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen? Who says that he did it himself?
2065	Porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs because some people do not like them? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? No. If you do not like porn, you should not watch it. It is your right to watch it.
2066	My parents spend all of their money and time on others rather than themselves.
2067	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity. However, we do not live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I believe that everyone has a talent that can be used to improve society. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our lives would be much smoother.
2068	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can create as a group. For example, that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference, but when you look at the whole population, the percentage is greater than those who did vote. So if you want to be down and win, you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.
2069	I believe that school uniforms are a good idea because students do not spend a lot of time choosing and buying clothes for school, especially girls. That is why they can use more time to study.
2070	I believe they are good because all the girls out there would not tease each other about fashion issues. It also makes all students look and feel equal, which increases their attention on school work since they do not have to think about whether they are wearing the most expensive clothes at school or whether they look the best.
2071	Fathers can sometimes be lousy, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Fathers are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them. You cannot have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what your height is, fathers are the people you look up to the most.
2072	This is a load of bull crap. These arguments are not factual and make your team seem foolish.
2073	You want money or would you like to live longer without water? Have fun with that.
2074	TV is better than books because the educational programs on TV are more convenient and easy to understand. Additionally, it is easier for people who cannot see or hear. Books are also more likely to be out of date with the latest information about a certain topic, while information on TV can be much more accurate and useful.
2075	Television uses electricity and books such as Harry Potter are made from trees, so it causes more damage to the environment.
2076	Banning bottled water would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. The reason is that water bottles are made from plastic and advertising on them is also big business. Compostable water bottles are also coming onto the market which can be used instead of plastics.
2077	The global bottled water industry has exploded to over $35 billion. Americans alone paid $7.7 billion for bottled water in 2002.
2078	We know that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.
2079	From a religious point of view homosexual marriage is not even possible. Let alone right. However, everyone is not religious or adheres to specific religious guidance. Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions however, are a different matter.
2080	I vote "Wrong" because it goes against human nature and, as other voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". And you cannot exclude religion from this argument, because that is what happens when people do not have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to guide us as to what is right and what is wrong. Without it, we are lost.
2081	Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage? Which country legalized homosexual unions which lead to a lower marriage rate?
2082	I do not respect other opinions, but I believe that homosexual marriage is against my moral law.
2083	I am a Christian, and the bible clearly states that homosexuality is wrong. I am not a pathetic, weak, or any other name you may call me, but I know for sure that the bible is the truth.
2084	India is a good country to live in. It has diverse culture but still unites as one.
2085	I do not want to show my country down, and the person who thinks that only debate will solve all problems is wrong because they also know what their country is like.
2086	India and China both have the potential to lead the world.
2087	Atheism is a very cool guy. He makes my logic work and is not afraid of anything.
2088	It is ignorant and idiotic to think that God exists. Any other argument is completely invalid.
2089	Yes, spanking should be used as a last resort in disciplining children.
2090	Yes, because sometimes it won't work, so they need a little spanking to teach them they were wrong. Don't always spank them for no reason, that is bad.
2091	I think that children should get spanked occasionally. I was spanked when I was little, but I definitely learned lessons. Do not spank your children with anything you find because you do not want to kill them.
2092	Depending on the punishment you give a child, it doesn't always work. Some children need that because sitting them in punishment is a possibility that they will do it again.
2093	I believe in Christianity and I am fortunate enough to attend a Christian school where I get to learn more about our wonderful God.
2094	I have found more peace in my belief and will continue to seek the Lord until I die.
2095	No, since they do not understand what they are doing since they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.
2096	No, because spanking might affect the relationship between the child and parents, and children can pick up on the parents' attitude by acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example, using other techniques.
2097	The child is young and does not know what is wrong and what is right.
2098	I do not think anybody would want to be spanked by their parents. Therefore, spanking should not be an option.
2099	Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause them to stutter.
2100	Murder is always committed with the best of intentions. It cannot possibly be a mistake if I stab someone in the leg with a sharp object and say that it was not my intention to make him bleed. My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman who is possibly schizophrenic.
2101	If a woman is raped and is left with the fetus, she should put it up for adoption. If someone murders a pregnant woman, they will be charged with killing the woman and the fetus. People have the misconception that a fetus is an unborn baby.
2102	The debate is not about whether murder is morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy. In addition, you may want to brush up on your etymology and vary your sources rather than simply paraphrasing definitions that fit your point of view.
2103	I do not agree. There are many people in my school who are obese and have two periods of urine a week and afterschool sports has not helped them a bit.
2104	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between the person and his/her love interest. Love is all that some people have. You cannot take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't choose to be gay either. Who would choose to live that way? It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be receptive to them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way.
2105	The "who gives a crap" button was your browser's back button. It baffles me to see people take the time to post a comment that says they don't care and everyone should stop talking about it.
2106	I believe marriage is ridiculous and should not exist. In fact, that is another debate entirely. To me, who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. I think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well. It would certainly be an entertaining ceremony far more so than any wedding I have ever attended.
2107	In my opinion, if you improve yourself in the long run, you can improve the world.
2108	If I say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then I am lying to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but there are too many bad things happening in the world and what you do won't really make a difference. A personal pursuit does more for you than trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.
2109	I believe that a personal pursuit is better because you can't help others if you can't help yourself.
2110	We need to keep our jobs at home, pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which wouldn't be near what it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along. Stop voting for self-raises for our political leaders, and stop trying to be the world's peacemakers, money controllers, both providing and then forgiving debt only to "loan" more. And realize that all the world has the same abilities and resources we started with, they just need to make a choice to utilize the resources they have and develop a work ethic and use it.
2111	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the death penalty. But you must also know, that Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so fast.
2112	I believe that freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer free of speech.
2113	If you are fired, you have to pay back all wages owed to you and any other compensation such as vacation pay, etc. On the spot. As a manager, you are responsible for those under you and the money. Your boss has to prove you took the money, but you might be able to get your job back. You could possibly sue for Wrongful Termination if your boss cannot prove you took the money.
2114	There are many aspects of reservation in India. There are many aspects of reservation. For example, there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness. However, there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people. It is taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class. Hence, you and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who reaps benefit.
2115	If he is unhappy about your dogs, then that is where your problem is. You need to find a good home for the dogs, train your dogs, or move out to a house to keep the neighborhood peace. It is really up to you.
2116	I would call the police and see what they find out. Since the girl did not do anything illegal, it is not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
2117	You cannot sue your company for a condition that you may have been prone to get due to poor health, eating habits, or laziness. Taking your pituitary gland out will not cause you to get diabetes. Sorry, but the company is only responsible for an injury you sustained while on the job. If you leave your job, your next job should provide you with health coverage.
2118	I missed the last change by a few months, so I understand how unpopular this sounds.
2119	I cannot find any good unethical arguments to rationalize his actions. You mean good unethical ones to justify his actions. Didn't Hitler think the same way? For the good of the many means violating the US Constitution. And it really isn't fiction. You just need some ammunition. Well you won't get it here! And there was nothing ethical about nuking Japan. Truman was led to believe they were military targets, when in fact most were women and children. There wasn't a military target in sight! And we didn't have to nuke two cities!
2120	I do not think there will be laws protecting white men. I do not think there should be any law that would protect whites.
2121	Unless you are in a private college where government funds are not used, your tuition is about half the cost of your education.
2122	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can say whatever you want, as long as it does not cause harm to others.
2123	If he drives too fast for you, speed up yourself as much as possible. If he is speeding or driving recklessly, then the cops can ticket him. There is no law that says managers must hold back pizzas just so you can deliver them. In fact, it goes against every cannon of customer service. The faster the delivery, the better (as long as nobody gets injured).
2124	It is ridiculous that generosity and guest treatment are abused by some Muslims.
2125	First of all, incest is not always "child abuse." Sexual intercourse between closely related adults is common. In the USA, incest is not common. There is a stereotype about the south, that it happens there a lot. This is false.
2126	Brian Doyle not only got what he deserved, he should have gotten it for the last time he did it. Without law enforcement being able to improvise criminals would run amok in this country. It is hard enough anymore just to get a conviction with all the legal loopholes created by liberal lawyers in this country much less anyone doing any serious time for such illicit behavior.
2127	I haven't heard of it, but it sounds like she could get help through a pro-bono place or a low income based legal services. You would be surprised at what some places consider LOW INCOME. My sister's husband brings home at least $400.00 a week (in winter) and at least $600.00 a week (in summer). They have a three person household and they get approximately $46,000 a year bring home and they get help from W.I.C., Daycare Asst., food, etc.
2128	Absolutely not. It is the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state.
2129	I agree, it is not wise to punish the lazy and let the wives beat booze heads walk free. Throw the potheads in prison.
2130	I do not know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but my personal opinion is that historically, when human rights were defined, women were not included.
2131	I think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly that misogynistic world you describe. For example, 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world living in poverty are women. Additionally, two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls. Additionally, 75% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women. Women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet only earn 10% of the world's income and own less than 1% of the world's property. How can anyone NOT be a feminist?
2132	If you get caught, the theater manager has the discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back. This is dishonest and stealing.
2133	The principle here is not that they are able to kill people but for what reason? The execution of a known felon who has murdered countless lives has forfeited his/her right to live under the eyes of the law. If he/she were to be set free and thus cause more deaths on the population it is justified to take his life for the general good. They are against violence, random and senseless violence that is. Sanctioned killings whereby a person has committed crimes deemed irreconcievable in the eyes of the community is not a crime nor hyprocracy but justified and necessary. As for war, it depends on the reason, to the defense of life and country it is a noble cause, for an outster of a regime not friendly to a nation that cherishes life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
2134	If he prescribed the medication, he bears the legal responsibility, but it is possible that he does not actually have access to the records. However, regardless of the case, your access to your medical records is guaranteed by federal law. Whoever owned the facility would be responsible for maintaining those records. In general, I agree with these other guys. He knows he is in trouble and he is trying to weasel out. Strengtharm him.
2135	I believe that the mother should have the right to "no contact." However, there could be an intermediary who could be contacted in the event of a medical emergency. Women need to have this safeguard so they won't feel pressured by the judgmental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It is very sad that abortions are frequently chosen because of these reasons.
2136	I disagree because I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune. I owe no one and will walk away from anyone who tries to take from me what I have worked for. My brother and I were the only white kids in the projects. Talk about unfair! Take your cry for reparations to someone else. I simply do not buy it.
2137	I personally would think that it is a deterrent and would think long and hard about doing something wrong if I had to do something like that. If you commit a crime you will be required to pay society back one way or another.
2138	Many wish he would be. However, the reality is if he does, there would be great uproar. The American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower bracket earners. The woes would just be unbearable!! The economy of the USA would be negatively affected or even bought down lower than it already is.
2139	No one should be treated like a lesser person because of their race, ancestry, or any other factor. You should not be judged based on your race, ethnic background, or any other factor.
2140	I think we are becoming a communistic country trying to pass a law like that. Who knows what the law is supposed to be about? It is about saying what a person can or can't spend on food. It is helping our economy. There is more to obesity than buying too much food. Some obese people do not eat much, but what they are eating is junk and empty calories. Some try to buy healthy and get things like Slim Fast full of preservatives and poisons. Some just do not exercise. Maybe we should pass a law for mandatory exercise or health and nutrition classes. Maybe we should stop selling a bunch of junk and make organic and natural foods more affordable.
2141	You had a child with this person and you are going to have to share parenting time with this person unless you can prove in some way that this person is an unsuitable parent or is in the process of commiting crimes. Truthfully, this person deserves to have parenting time and influence in the course of this child's life.
2142	Well, a private attorney in a murder case is going to cost between 30 and 50 thousand dollars. If you do not have that kind of money, you might not have a choice.
2143	You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents, you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce anywhere without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself.
2144	If you are serious about stopping him, contact the police. If it is a civil matter, speak with an attorney about bringing a case against your stepson. It might not be worth the time, effort, and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.
2145	If life were fair, inncocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, and good people would not be poor.
2146	I have lost all hope for a progressive movement in this country. I have been defending Obama for 6 years to all my conservative friends in a very red State while he kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the GOP alternative to single payer, kept the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA, etc. etc. Hillary Clinton will probably win the Democratic primary and will probably be the next President, and if anything, she will be even less progressive than the disappointment that is Obama. Please, change my mind before I become a 25 year old husk of a man.
2147	I love bulldogs, pugs and dogs in general, but due to designer breeding, these short nose type of dogs have terrible breathing problems and a host of other health problems are generally expected. Every bubble of air is a struggle, which is probably a factor of why they sleep so much and probably is a cause for several of those health problems. It breaks my heart to see these amazing dogs gasping for air. I can imagine all the health problems I would have if I had to struggle with every breath. If I were misinformed please help, I would love to own a beautiful bully but I would feel terrible for all these reasons.
2148	I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do, but instead it is just a production line for the corporate world.
2149	I have been watching a CNN special in school about genocides after the holocene. The article believes that the US should have intervened in the conflicts. However, I do not think that the US should have intervened in the conflicts because it is not their responsibility to help anyone. I think that the US should be viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower. However, if we do nothing, we are viewed as oil seeking imperialists. I do not think the US should be fighting other peoples fights. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort themselves out. Change my view! Thank you.
2150	This may vary by country, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive. I see people complain that they can buy chicken breast in bulk that will last months, buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain that healthy food is expensive).
2151	I believe that sports in general are a tremendous waste of time, energy, and money. I believe that far too much effort, manpower, and resources, both mental and physical, are poured into meaningless feats of strength. These resources could be used to change our society for the better.
2152	Most people, rather than form an unbiased opinion about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons. For example, when two people with differing views discuss politics, each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds. However, most political discussions end with both parties saying what amounts to "Your arguments are less convincing than mine." There is some "meta" reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason is not rational.
2153	I was talking with my parents who are both vehemently religious and I realized that while religion does contribute to wars, the biggest problem with religion is that it prevents the spread of advancement in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (with issues in climate change and evolution), and society, specifically in the areas of same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, etc.
2154	I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism?
2155	I went deep sea fishing last weekend at the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fetched, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish, live fish that we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and threw them in the water. I can't find any reason to justify this behavior as moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish, suffering then ended when they were eaten. At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through their face, fetched for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over. I did not like it, except I did. Fishers... Change my view?
2156	I think the Tories are selfish money hoarders who don't care about anyone except themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman who was previously the Minister for Women and Equality but who also voted against gay marriage. She's highly in favor of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of the country (like academies and raising tuition fees even further). I doubt that anything will change from Gove's reign of terror. We may even see it get worse.
2157	I believe natural rights do not exist. I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth.
2158	I've always thought that someone recording a video should hold the device vertically so that they can't see it later on when it is being watched on YouTube or Facebook. This is a trivial issue, but it just annoys me that someone doesn't take into consideration how the video will look later when it is watched later on on YouTube or Facebook.
2159	I believe that it should be up to parents whether or not children are vaccinated. Some people do not get vaccinated and live long healthy lives, while others do not. This is due to our biology.
2160	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and have not found anything resembling a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. This begs the question, "external source of consciousness or internal source of consciousness?" We could just as easily be a host for consciousness which has an external source, as we could be just a random accidental chemical self-awareness.
2161	I am reminded of why I can't stand soccer (football). I am not comparing it to American team sports because at its core I believe soccer is one of the most beautifully dramatic sports. There are documented cases of corruption in other "major" team sports, however soccer's corruption is on an entirely different level.
2162	I believe that if it hadn't been for the genocide, Germans would have been prouder of their history.
2163	I would rather be saved that heartache in the first place rather than be surprised. I would want to know immediately that my mother, father, or son was coming home early, rather than feeling sad about it longer than necessary, and lying is a bad move.
2164	I often read people talking about the idea of natural rights which are universal and inalienable. However, I disagree that such rights are simply constructs, and have no basis beyond any other construct humanity has created. While there can be some appeal to human nature, nearly all universal behaviour that could be classified as rights only apply to the "in-group" and certainly none seem to apply to humanity as a whole. The extension of rights to cover everyone a construct, and not part of fundamental human nature. This is why law exists in general. It's an extension of tribal self-rule for larger groups. There is certainly nothing about the nature of reality that causes rights to exist.
2165	I understand that this has been asked before but I would like to get some fresh thoughts. So, I don't really have a definition for greatest, but I guess it's open for interpretation.
2166	Neither of these two Italian crooners were really gifted singers. Dino had the better voice, more range and better tambre. Dino's early inspirations, his model singers were more blues and jazz based Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing far better than Martion. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither are jazz singers.
2167	I am amazed that the havn't permanently put duct tape over Biden's mouth. The stupid things that come out of his mouth.
2168	We did not impeach GW, so why on earth did we impeach Clinton? All he did was get his knob polished, GW sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that have cost thousands of lives, and trashed our name throughout the world. What Clinton did should have remained between him and Hill', it is no worse than what other great presidents did.
2169	We are all people at the end of the day and if someone likes the same sex relationships it is their problem. I believe that gay and lesbian couples are not hurting anyone and should be happy.
2170	Macs are cheaper with more powerful hardware, but Macs use generic hardware, not specific apple hardware as is often believed. People also believe that Macs need to be replaced less often than PCs.
2171	The Lion King has a much more serious and dramatic undertone than Aladdin. This is due to my personal preference for drama.
2172	A religious debate accomplishes nothing. Instead insults are passed and one side or the other is seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because somebody quotes scientific or Biblical 'evidence' that may or may not exist or be a firm as is made sound. Furthermore, speaking for both sides, both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so each side will just pick each other apart as able.
2173	California is the best! It is a land of opportunity. It has the tenth largest economy in the world. It is free from some of the hate/racism that you see in other states. It has some of the most beautiful natural landscapes and destinations in the world. It is birthplace of technology and the new frontier for the modern world.
2174	It is ZED people! When you are talking to someone over the phone and you need to spell something that has the letter ZED, it is clear as day when you say ZED. If you are talking to a Yankee and are forced to say ZEE, you get a lot of this "did you say V? Or was that a D?". Let's change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
2175	This is a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship between Israel and the U.S. We have helped Israel become a nation that relies on terror and violence against opposition instead of balancing strength with diplomacy. If Israel decides to preemptively attack Iran without due process, it will receive blind support from the U.S. government.
2176	I think that sums up what most young people are listening to. It is the insanely idiotic rap music with the constant references to money, cars, and bullshit.
2177	Suicide is a disease that can be prevented.
2178	We see different colors all the time, most of them are shades of other colors.
2179	The stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.
2180	I do not understand how the motto conflicts with separation of Church and State asserting that the State is not atheist. I think the motto should stand--even though many atheists may be irritated by it.
2181	Agents. This is a call center. Even though management is the one creating the "strategy", if it is not favorable to the Agents, they need to come up with another plan. Unless the "power" kicks in, the Agents will not be able to do anything but to follow.
2182	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth, you need proof to validate your claim. If you refuse to give your fellow man this proof, you are hindering his or her ability to encounter the truth. And quite frankly, if he or she was to die thereafter and was condemned for eternity, is their blood not on your hands? You had the means to save them but did not. If you can't offer proof of your beliefs, that is okay.
2183	It is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say that evolution is about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is not the case. Gravity is just a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.
2184	My date had a prime rib and I had a burger with three different types of meat in it. My date loved the prime rib and her mashed potatoes and my burger was cooked to a perfect medium. The only downside I would have to say was the mac and cheese. We will definitely go back!
2185	The atmosphere is very comfortable and fits in perfectly with the Canadian theme. I have had a few dishes here, the lobster roll, PEI mussels, and boneless back rib burger, all of which I would recommend. However, the daily noodle is scarce, so I will definitely be going back.
2186	I went in on a Monday night and there were several servers there but none came to take our drink order for 15 minutes so we left. The manager came by at one point and asked how we were doing as he walked by but he asked and kept walking. Why ask how I'm doing if you clearly do not care or want to know why?
2187	The food was amazing and our server Samantha was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, she may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change and I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have gone back and questioned it but we did not keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it.
2188	I tried two curries and pad Thai and I must say that this place is the best and most authentic Thai food I have had in Arizona.
2189	I had a group of 12 people and it was not a good experience.
2190	I was very disappointed in the food portions for the price point. I was disappointed in the food portions for the price point. I was disappointed in the missing items in my take out order. The juice was good but it better be if it cost $7. I will always try a new place once. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place or go back again.
