0	I believe students should wear what is most comfortable to them and feel free about their clothes.
1	I respect the freedom to express my individuality without being laughed at.
2	I don't know how exactly the people thought you were going to explain society but... Fair trade capitalists. Extreme right
3	Students should wear what they like and feel free to do so.
4	students should wear their fancy clothes but stop being rude to their classmates .
5	I aboud this book.tv is boring and parents are wasting money
6	TV brainwashing spoils kids youth. Read a book every day.
7	I think that TV is a waste of time because you can't really learn things in it
8	I agree that book are better than tv. I hates tv cause i can put you in one world and it is educational but this is moronous imho it is great tv can be enjoyable
9	I believe that there is no television that can compete with a book.
10	Books aren't as bad as television, we have the freedom to choose what and where to watch. That being said, too much television does not bode well for children's thinking. It trains children to constantly seek the "entertainment factor" and use logic to break into the entertainment industry. Many children abuse medication. Books are a holistic tool that uses logic, pondering, and debate, which leads children to think critically. The difference between television, films, and books is that one can change one's outlook by any means. There is no wrong way.
11	Books are better than any form of entertainment. They should be encouraged. Children will be nurtured by reading books that change their perspective on life, and become philosophers. Television only throws the mind into madness and alienation. It should be discouraged. Fahrenheit 451, the Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... Do I have to further explain...
12	Books, television, technology do not destroy our morals. Music by the way, I feel like it's a reliable drug that helps me detoxify from overwork and the stresses of everyday life. Both represent reality, though my music doesn't usually represent life itself..
13	I am against the use of social media. Television is bad and this world is going to the dogs on the basis that we don't understand natural science. We don't let the environment follow its natural cycle, we don't let nature rest, as we should. It is much better to read a book than to look at a sunset on television. The books are like angels to us.
14	Books should be passed down from generation to generation. There is value in knowledge, although the seminary, college, and university don't comprehend this, the people who do understand know what is in value in that book they just finished reading. Video games are nothing more than drugs; they provide little more than entertainment. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine. Fahrenheit 451, the Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... I don't need to explain more.
15	india is still good for me because it also a country that is developing well and the leader of the country should also be a good leader
16	india is is good in adopting policies but suffers because they are not putting those policies into practice
17	india is an uncomfortable country to work with, but it could provide new opportunities for certain people if it's properly developed.
18	as nuclear states keep backing away from nuclear disarmament, nuclear-armed middle powers like india are much more likely to jump on the nuclear bandwagon, with potentially
19	People in most poor countries are more selfish compared to people in wealthy countries. While wealth is not as much, people in poor countries tend to be more selfish compared
20	Yes, I'd rather be fatherless but that doesn't mean I have no respect for fathers and for everyone that cares for a child. I respect, value and praise them from the heart. I'd rather be fatherless than fathered in all sorts of crazy and destructive ways. I am a former yeshiva student who was raised in homes of this kind, without any sense of discipline or boundaries.  Use diverse vocabulary.
21	I have a strange sense of humor. That's why I recently bought the single "Streets of Europe" by the Stereophonics. It sounds quite funny. Then again, I think that going without a father is more important than being humorous(Finding), thus the purchase(Annotation). Honestly, I have no father at all, so my only influences are my late brother, my brother's woman, and my mom; for example, in character, I'm much more hardworking than my mother expects me to be, and I am also more masculine than my mom says I am(Character). I'm not sure what's wrong with me, maybe it's the harsh treatment I've received?
22	Unfortunately, I suspect that with the exception of rare, very special cases, having a father right now may be a benefit rather than a detriment. I say this simply because having a father and/or any male role model can affect the kids to behave better by modeling good character traits such as civic responsibility, competency, and independence among others.
23	I would be happier if my father never existed, and I would grow up without a father. It can be done. I feel as if I turned out better in life because of being fatherless, but this is very person specific. If I was raised differently, my life may not have been as productive and happy as it was.
24	I believe that I would work and be successful if I didn't have a father to model myself after, but just about every adult has one. It just takes work and discipline to prevent it from rubbing off on you. The hardest thing to do is ignore people who want to make you feel bad for not having a father in your life.
25	Raffles discovered Singapore during his first voyage in 1819. He was not aware of the fact that he had written his discovery two months before
26	Having never given any thought to this prior to the task, I'm unsure.
27	To what do you attribute Raffles' discovery of Singapore. As you know Raffles returned to England December 1819. A year before that he had written of his discovery as having happened on May 26 in 1819.This was the year that Madagascar was discovered. Madagascar could not have been discovered earlier.In
28	Raffles had discovered Singapore on his first journey, several months earlier. Although he had incorrectly thought he had discovered Singapore on his first voyage. Raffles was greatly influenced by Captain Cook's voyages around the world
29	Raffles had written his discovery wrongly as 29 February 1819.It was later corrected. He thought he had discovered Singapore on his firs journey
30	I believe that evolution is one of the strongest scientific theories and I embrace the science. I seek a life that is balanced, in terms of spirituality and science. When studying biology, I found that the miracle of our bodies was even more than I could have imagined. I am an avid fan of hard science such as technology and entrepreneurship. I believe that I have a responsibility to embrace new ideas and new technologies and push the boundaries that might not even exist today.
31	Biology makes me wonder if there was no creator who is capable of designing a living organism (that can be examined with the naked eye, weighed, measured, and researched) with an incredibly complex design, capable of functioning properly and for a long time. If there was no creator, then I would need to find proof of a reason for this miracle, which can only be explained through evolution.
32	I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. We are all genetically unique creatures. Without evolution no one would be here to ask the question "who made me?" If man truly was capable of perfecting himself in the year 2000, there are countless human groups that have already been perfected. If man truly were capable of perfecting himself in the year 2000, there are countless human groups that have already been perfected.
33	I have strong religious beliefs and have studied many fields, including biology. I am convinced that all things evolved. That we were not put here for accident or chance. I am also a believer in "once was better" in biological terms.
34	I believe the answer to that question must be at least questionable without any statistical evidence or reason. If you know you're going to die and can only live for a decade, you might want to live in a state that recognizes people in groups who would rather eat human flesh to get a guarantee that they could eat for that length of time. I love working as a nurse, and am very protective of my patients, but the science behind nursing will be always be questioned.
35	It is a misconception that Firefox leaks memory like a sieve. Just to make it clear, the specs (compiled with gcc 4.8.0 with standard optimization), are as follows:  Desired memory usage for a Chrome window: 19.1MB  Desired memory usage for a Firefox window: 310.1MB  Desired memory usage for a Firefox window, with tabs open: 320.6MB  Des
36	Google Chrome releases memory like an overflowing toilet bowl. An opened session of Chrome 3.0.203.12 on Ubuntu, three tabs, one week, uses 250  Meg of memory under Task Manager on Windows.
37	But it is much better than Explorer. See my posting """"""""""""""""The ▁ Librarian and Firefox""""""""""""""" for details.
38	Yes I am aware of the memory leak issue on Firefox. There is currently a work around which should make the issue go away. Unfortunately, it's not always possible to fix things right away.
39	Use a modern browser like Chrome or Internet Explorer. I am also fine with a few minor bugs in Firefox.
40	Porn is not inherently wrong. It just can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved by choice. It is really simple as that. The responsibility lies with the individual, not the porn producer.
41	Porn isn't inherently wrong because It's just that simple. Porn isn't inherently wrong, because if you don't want to see it you can choose not to, and there's no reason to say otherwise.
42	Porn is not a right or wrong choice, but the support you provide for your porn consumption is highly concerned. Most people take pleasure in the effects that pornography brings to them. This pleasure can take the form of frustration or disappointment, particularly when they can't always find what they crave.
43	Porn isn't inherently wrong because It really can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice.It really is just as simple as that.
44	Mothers can't protect children from porn because young boys and girls will pick it up out of curiosity and if its being seen from home. Some mothers say girls don't learn it from home due to religion but that isn't true. Girls learn to pick up and relate to things that's open to them that is done
45	A parent is the main form of emotion a person receives. A child has the potential for great things but if a child lives a lousy life it will corrupt their character and way of thinking. Therefore it is always better to work with a father and mother. If not then there is a certain social institution called therapy.   ### Instruction: Below are two paragraphs describing a scenario.
46	We are as much genetically effected by family as we are environmentally. Scientists are learning more about genetics so I believe that physical and mental growth can be affected by having a healthy home life and having a good father.
47	Having a mom and dad may be healthier for a child, as well as some science. Social support from family is important, and some man need some structure, or theirs could be strained. Being a lousy father would affect self esteem, and there are help programs out there for abused/parents.
48	Excluding questions of abuse, studies say that single mothers tend to have bigger babies and are at a higher risk of becoming obese, and have lower educational attainments as well as higher incidence of depression. Having a mother is best.
49	A child grows up better with a mother and father as family. Though one father is not better than another. That is what research has to say. It also says that children who are subjected to child abuse, trauma, and things like that, grow up worse than children raised without these influences.   The point is that nobody is perfect. A child does not need to grow up without a family but they don't grow better without a father either. No one can be perfect.
50	The law of nature could be very clear: everything returns to its source. When you dig a deep hole, it eventually comes back up to the surface. The end. In the same way, only thing that isn't dying is growth. That depends on the initial amount of energy and nutrients. As we can see, we are not living a fair amount and the world on earth will end. The rise in communication and global information is the gift of the internet, and the result of its invention. We can kill, that is born, we can destroy
51	People should continue to seek the change that they can make themselves. I hope that my father is a good father. It does not matter if I do meet him, since his good and kind heart may be different than mine. If I met him as a child maybe I would have become what my father wanted for me to become. In this case that is good.
52	I share the sentiment of Professor Cash's essay. The world will never be the same again. My father can't be mistaken for his father, so I shouldn't be mistaken for him. But I never know what's ahead. How can one be sure?
53	People can and should change to better themselves. I would prefer to have a father than to see myself become a better one. These changes may be hindered by education, but I would also like to have access to education.
54	To my knowledge people are able to change. I would rather be a good person and never meet my father than a piece of paper I can't really be proud of with no real record of achievement.
55	Fair trade, free markets, nuclear power, renewable energy, green power to reduce pollution. There are no mistakes or tragedies... but
56	I totally hate you pal, I really do and I don't expect you to love me because you can do better but you won't. I guess
57	I think that no, we have a lot of good water in the world, but people use and abuse it to such a degree that it
58	I would hate to see any deal come from them because of the oil and trash they cause. the planet is about to go into meltd
59	I question whether my current lifestyle is sustainable. I do not think that a parent, who spends more time with their children, will put
60	No, India have the potential to lead the world but we don't. india are selfish people due to low literacy level . freighter are not going to lead the world because they are selfish people. As india is developing country therefore we have low literacy level .
61	the world will end in two minutes first because we humans are stupid and more evil than beasts (lololololololololollllll) and then it's because of the general silent acceptence for truths, so the truth is that humans should take up religion, being god's chosen ones, yet they and millions of others live like animals that do not know truth and live as crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am sure the current world will end in under 25 ans!!!!:(((((:(((((
62	The greatest potencial we have is capacity to learn, intelligence, science, education and human potential, no one else. India is one of the countries in the world that has the greatest human capacity and has the potential to lead the world. India may not lead the world today but the world will come to India one day.
63	Yes India is the country with the potential to lead the world. Nobody knows where our country is going to lead to. If we don't try our best we can't control the changes and we can't change anything. But, nobody can say that without doing something. You have to believe in yourself. If you really believe in yourself, you'll definitely succeed. And, you have to do your best to achieve your goal.
64	Come to India please. You won't regret it. Its the paradise in the world! And, believe in yourself! And, who knows, you can live in this paradise and help this country grow by bringing its language up and showing the world how beautiful it is. I know, it sounds wonderful. The moment you arrived here, you'll be the proud Indian. Unless, of course, you're the Indian who believes he has to follow the rules. Arvind Kejriwal
65	I would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
66	I would turn them in, and apologise. Maybe also ask them to apologize to their family and loved ones who they killed, and what can be done to make things better. You say you don't kill because you have a conscience?
67	I would probably not turn in my notes or spend time with someone who would kill someone and get away with it.
68	I would say that instead of just adding another tool to make another dimaanling idiot, i would turn them in instead.
69	Because killing people and getting away with it isn't right, and i wouldn't want to be next to someone who murders people.
70	The government should NOT have the right to tell a woman what she can do with her own body. This is slavery. Men can also not do these things. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different. A woman may be allowed to forgo contraception, or not take the drugs a man gave to her, or do so at their discretion. A man may never be permitted to make those choices with his wife.
71	1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states
72	The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever. 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public there are many others. Men can also not do these things. 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public
73	The government tells a woman what she can do with her own body ALL THE TIME. This is no different than telling a man what to do with his own body. So who decides where men and women can move their bodies? It is obvious that men and women have differing views on physicality which cannot be controlled through government.
74	Plenty of states allow men to display their naked bodies all the time while not allowing women to do so. THAT should change. Women should have the same rights that men have in our lawful country. There should be a law that prohibits police from touching a woman as a means of restraint. And a police academy should be opened to train policemen, to be brought into being after a mandatory probationary period of their every day duties. You can even work as a police officer after having completed that university program if you so choose.
75	Yes, that is a living soul, a part of my body. I don't see that as destroying the human being who will become, yes, a member of society but at the same time still alive in full measure of being as they grow up.
76	No, only cells are living. The mother is alive but with the baby it's possible she is not because of the rare cases of a living child inside a body. The mother should be treated just like any other mother.
77	While I want to end abortion on demand, I think life begins at conception. A lot of people disagree with me on this point but I feel that true freedom comes with taking responsibility for your own actions and not being able to blame others for mistakes. I also think that pro-life people should feel free to get married without fear of prosecution.
78	No, the baby is not living. His life does not start until he is born and that was his first breath.
79	We have to make sure our own lives and healthcare system is so good that all babies don't need to be on lives outside of this one.
80	I believe that homosexuality can be a good thing when it is balanced, that is, if two married people go on vacation together, then so can two men or two women. I am therefore in favor of gay marriage, although I believe that Mosy people don't have to support it, because gays and lesbians are people too, not a gender.
81	I do not think that gay marriage should be allowed in the United States. I don't see a downside to it. It is just a personal choice. All I know is that...
82	Yes I think abortion is wrong. For women having an abortion isnt right for either of the parties it affects the baby so  mother and mother-in-law  should not accept the baby.
83	Yes I believe that gay marriage should be allowed. Basically everything else is about growing up and coming of age and having a relationship with someone of a different sexuality that's what all this is about  making more people have a real life, rather than just pursuing their own desires the rest is like putting a bandage over an already broken thing the whole society is already leaning heavily toward poor relationship's now with more gay marriage theres gonna be so many more bad relationships this is one of the reason why hate speech happens ...
84	I support gay marriage, regardless of their feelings on homosexuality. I believe that love between all people is a basic human right. I am a politician that believes in democracy, and therefore support the right of individuals to marry the people they want to, instead of the government.
85	For legal advice, speak to a lawyer. You may not, however, enjoy the consequences for violating the terms and conditions if you do. Specifically, you could not provide, or host websites promoting, the kind of self-promotion you're doing here without proper compensation (either monetary or otherwise). Don't forget that you're also violating the terms of the license if you publicly host it. The online community will realize that you abided by the terms if you get tagged on tagicious.com or another similar service.
86	I don't know if a lawyer would feel the same way, but as someone who is not a lawyer, the case is made. "If you would like to know more about the legal aspect of this, that is well within the terms of the license. For example, PayPal makes money (kinda) from the PayPal Store, so they are monetizing their own products. But that's not the point. You are not illegally converting copyrighted works for financial gain. It's not the license that prohibits that."
87	As noted in the question, direct your questions to a lawyer. Given the specific wording in the license, this should be clear. The license only allows you to make money from sharing out the artwork for non-commercial purposes. So if you're sharing artwork on Facebook or other social media sites, you should be fine. Sharing it through a blog page such as this one however, which is not factually receiving monetary benefit from the artwork in any way, can result in violating the terms of the license.
88	I wouldn't want the product as I understand it, but I'm not a lawyer either. I'd think of my paypal address if I was not sure. I'd put my payment in an account only to withdraw it if I was not satisfied with the results. I'd agree that I wouldn't want the product as I understand it, because it's full of propaganda, but it's fair trade. The product shows the "unspoken truths" in free country Western movies, which includes every weak romantic gesture (and candy everytime something happens), as well as Hollywood '80's/90's commercial sexism and hatred (Box Brownies + make sure to return the address to John Wall for the DC+) that the bride's family thinks is flattering but actually demeans all men.
89	The law generally does not define "primarily intended" in a manner that is not "benefits to private monetary compensation". This is an important point. See also this discussion of what constitutes copyright infringement and copyright law.  In particular:  You are advised to first talk to a lawyer about whether your use of the product is compliant with the terms of the license. I agree to your use being compliant with the terms of the license, but I do not agree with the majority of these terms.
90	Many young people commit crime so that they don't have to make decent money or attempt to educate themselves because they believe the same crap you did.  I believe it is not right that people in prison simply for being poor, and though I understand that not being able to pay for health care is shameful,  they only call this at a cost they have not paid for in life.  I am against the jail system, and wish it would never exist.
91	No.  I fully support the state having its workers health care.  Its funding comes directly out of the profits of the companies not the taxpayer. The USA is very fortunate to have this system in place for the benefit of the citizens not government. You are right that prison is a major drain on resources.  The problem is that the taxpayer funds most of prison here and therefore we can not afford to waste it.
92	If you had stayed on your land, and not moved to the Americans, and had not committed crimes, you would not have served years in prison, and possibly your brother too. Thus, health care is the same for all: if you commit crimes, they get to jail for years.  Using the example of being in jail, whether you moved to the US illegally, or committed crimes, it is true that you have been robbed.  These stats show the fact that the Americans use crime as an avenue to not...
93	Since my religion will get an updated list of businesses and companies who decide not to support any organisation from speaking with a government, so these consequences arise. Just because someone is incarcerated, does not mean they did not contribute to society.  And so much onion rings is included.  I can't provide more than that but if that means you are going to develop an idea on if there is a treatment scheme, like melatonin which is a drug and not medication, there is no shame in that if it saves someone from being incarcerated, then please just stop reading this email and go develop that idea if your life is more important than the ideas which you write.  ### Instruction: Write an opinion, why the author supports B12 and melatonin, however not for self-medication
94	I can live with that. I'm not worried about jail, I like jail (I work every day so I know it is not a dormant shame). A lot of people say, "If you go to jail you will make money with it." Wrong, I learn so much from it. I would rather spend half a day in jail on a project, then be sad and regret having spent a day at home. I would rather spend half a day...
95	I am against all of the government handouts they are giving out, including medicare, medicare for all, social security, housing assistance, welfare, unemployment benefits, food stamps. The other problem they want me to acknowledge is that they are given cell phones by government for free. Government do not want to get their hands dirty or have their records opened. The government spies on the people. They want to keep the people from speaking up or making mistakes. They want you to stay put and they want to know where you are at all times. That is ridiculous.
96	I feel it's totally against everything that's American. How about everywhere straps a GPS system to it's legs so the government knows where everyone is. Besides this the government is saying it all in public safety. I don't know how safe I feel if I know someone is listening to my phone calls. Give me a break if I wanted to blow some shit up I wouldn't talk on the phone to make plans for it anyway.
97	I don't agree that the government should be in control of every aspect of life. It's the people's right to hold people accountable when they break the law, even if it means spending a little time behind bars. I think it's ridiculous to have people wear tracking devices, and I can't believe that terrorists would actually use the government to track their every move.
98	I believe in free markets, and cell phones are a tool for keeping the economy healthy. An iPod touch is a great tool to train up the next generation of engineers. I absolutely dislike the idea of straps on GPS because i hate that I can't leave my house without it, and that they have to access people's movements. Cell phones need to be strong to get through 5g. The government need to take back control on where citizens leave their homes and what they do and find this overwhelming and time consuming.
99	Everyone needs more freedom! Don't take away our rights! No more social media restrictions! If you take away freedom and people have no choice then what better chance do they have to commit terrorism? To get rid of the government it is necessary to have society in order. The future of America is bleak without freedom and respect for rights and privacy and people will still be able to commit terrorism.
100	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader? "No you do not. He was writing about how the idea of freedom from oppression is catching." "So why not? The same basic conditions apply as when Che was alive."
101	I oppose and do not support the political movement that was formed by Che Guevara. I do not support slavery, war, or oppression. This is not to say that I agree with the evils that are passed off as the "holy" cause, such as invading another country.
102	Yes, but like any "prophet". I think the basic premise is simply stupid. No disrespect intended, but I wish I had a better explanation. Just saying." The representative from Kerry's barnthouse party will introduce the bill to provide economic stimulus
103	Yes, Che Guevara, who also wrote about the idea of freedom from oppression, works in the basics of the socialist revolution. He was also a revolutionary. It may be time to re-read what he said, to find out more.
104	No. He became a guerrilla, a rebel, an assassin, a communist, a myth. He wanted his followers to apply his ideas, but he didn't think that means adopting them. I guess it was unrealistic to think people wouldn't feel politically charged by thought leadership.
105	I believe that faith should inform public policy if our neighbor needs us to do so. We have agreed to abide by the majority until a new majority comes along. Each new majority brings its own set of values. At that point, the new majority may want more. This was my thinking after reading Hayek and analyzing a little bit of the Open Society Foundations. Check that out, it truly does is own value system..
106	We were created out of love and unity and the opposite of that is our fear of others and nature.  Our actions are based on our thoughts as much as we are based on our convictions. The greater idea above state is that the law is not a reflection of a proper morality but rather it reflects a set of religious and civic beliefs and often coincides with the majority. Claiming the legal right to rip you off over a debt outweighs the need and the potential for a good moral action done for the right reason.
107	...Marxism. I strongly reject any form of Marxism. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred. I do not think that the world will change much. There have always been storms and wars, and there always will be, because human nature is flawed and selfish. My values come from who I am, my beliefs and my influence on the world that I have a real interest in.
108	I believe that faith should inform public policy. I do believe that the majority should decide policies. however I think that this administration in particular is contradictory and hypocritical. I also agree with Vance's conclusion that we need faith to sustain the good, in the end. I also disagree with Kelly's position that we all should be divided. I think that in the end we should realize that unity is strength. I know that both sides should be careful, because if one party is left behind in this post modern world, that is when fear and control starts to overtake the middle.
109	The first rule of the republic is to hold to the beliefs of the majority. Since we came out of the mass majority into the mass minority under our current government, we need to break our ties to it and find a new majority. I have no problem with Martin Luther King. He is a noble individual, and his situation was not that nice; but I don't see what reason anyone would rebel against the beliefs of an individual citizen. We are a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic society, and since our current laws still allow for groups to be devised based on race, religion and class, the value of individuality would be forgotten and the laws written would in effect be against the Constitution. I also do not support the view that tolerance involves ignore opportunity to put individuality into action. I was lucky enough to be sheltered from all that torture and economic exploitation to which many children in america were subjected, and having seen this first-hand, and without grasping the meaning of it, it is a fantasy to pretend that something which my very limited knowledge tells me to question and protest is not real. I am on the day-trip of life for having doubts about my old ways and beliefs.
110	She is breaking a restraining order against you and she is unreasonable. You can make arrangements with a couple of others as to where you go, who you go with, and who you talk to. Tell her that you want to work on the relationship and make sure it starts with her changing hers.
111	Let it go. Get some perspective. Unplug yourself from his comments on Facebook, Twitter, etc. Be grateful for where you are. Put a stop to him seeing you. Know that this is just one man, and a bit of his life, and so it must stand. He doesn't mean anything to you, he is not you, and can do nothing to you.
112	Perhaps she just doesn't want you around anymore. Perhaps it is pay back for something you did, and she just can't get over what  you  did to her. This restraining order can be a piece of mind,"If he is not around me, he can't hurt me anymore."  It may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier. "If I don't see him, then I don't have to be reminded of how he has lied, cheated, let me down, whatever the case is".
113	There's no reason to be upset with my mother or stepfather. They understand me and want to protect me from negative events in my life. I would like to see them as positive, honest, helpful, entertaining, and gentle. They are not those people. They do not deserve to get my attention for something they didn't do.
114	If you can stay calm, and maybe get some distance from her, I would consider signing you a restraining order on him to protect yourself. That way he can't hurt you or do anything to make you unhappy. That way you would not have to live with this possibility everyday. If you still have feelings for him, that can be sorted out later.
115	I can't see how the adversarial judicial system helps to get at the truth. It seems more about how well an argument is presented that the facts of a case. The way that both sides draw conclusions, and attempt to manipulate the jury with emotional language into believing them seems deceptive. In addition the jury, who are basically untrained (in terms of weighing evidence) people decide which argument is better seems to be a poor method of getting at the truth.
116	It does not require a judge to be prejudiced.  It does allow the parties to put forward their own evidence. In contrast the adversarial system demands both sides to have an understanding of the state of the evidence. It allows for witnesses. And the best judge of a matter is the own party, not a trained (or unbiased) judge.
117	It is easier and quicker to reach a verdict. It offers the protection of the jury system of punishing guilty offenders. There are many factors in legal system that will prevent a miscarriage of justice.   It also allows for complex issues to be discussed under one roof in front of a sympathetic audience. The process will finally end after the questions have been answered. It offers an opportunity to save lives. It enables the jury to get the facts of a case before they are done with making their decision. It also helps deter perjury on both sides.
118	The adversarial judicial system is what feeds the world system - corporations and wealthy elites, and allows them to exploit and dominate others. It is deceptive and distorts justice for the sake of appealing to the public's emotions for gain and which does not assist in getting at the truth. It is possible that people are manipulated into believing the events presented in the system and then used. When would one ever want a jury of lay people, who can't imagine becoming part of a criminal trial, to decide a case and then use their findings to satisfy a lawyer who is no longer in touch with the practicalities of a criminal trial?  Next time, review the following parameters and the examples and response above and then submit a full analysis of one aspect or issue covered by each parameter:
119	Empirical evidence and legal history supports an adversarial system and an objective presentation of evidence. There was a 5:1 appellate rate in the Jacksonian era, despite numerous factors pushing a much higher ratio. Objective evidence is more convincing to a jury than a fairly worded and delivered emotional statement. The appeal process allows the accused the chance to present arguments that the state may have overlooked that should have influenced the conclusion of the case.
120	My simple rule when it comes to an airplane and a jet would be that an airplane can make a high jump and even for lift off, but if you begin to make sidewings it comes to the end quickly with flap failures and flat spots. On the other hand, a jet can make nose landings on steep landings, but it starts falling after a short plane. Flying through the clouds is fun, but actually landing at the wing of an airplane is not. For a plane, any numbers that start with 5 are awesome. For an airplane, all the numbers that start with 5 are easy and fun to fly, you can close and load in all the flaps.

121	And I have to say, it has taken more time to build a race car of course but still, the race car is superior in every way, more the mo... Thanks for the love and all the effort......I think the truck is best as it is a sleeker figure. the boat, sports car, and even the truck have the same downside. However, if you want to run the bridge with the ship I would recommend the submarine. the best vehicles for playing high school dodgeball... The Basketball...
122	It really does seem that the title and the plot summary do not go together at all. The question is really "what should a school do with a boy who has been working for eons to get $60,000"? Take a stand. Why would a boy who was working for months to get $60,000 be able to afford a pizza? Since you already know how long it takes to get that money, why is he responsible for his own lunch? Why should a single parent be responsible for their child's lunch? You can see the list is incomplete:  Make sure to have enough food to last a long day at the job or school. Look at your family budget to see if you have the money for things like one meal a day or more. If you need to, borrow the money. Have both parents agree to stop eating if you can't pay a bill. This may take a lot of work because you may need to change your dietary habits and that is hard.
123	I would agree that most bikes are a fool's errand. It would be a mistake to spend upwards of a few thousand dollars on a thrill ride, even without a helmet. The main downside of a mountain bike is that if you fall off the trail, it's very difficult to climb back up without assistance. The race car is superior on any surface but the cave, as with the downforce it controls your front end, and, your rear end, which is very useful when cornering. A cruiser is so fun on the beach and rock and rollers as they float with the waves and if you're lucky...
124	I like to race on Route, Beach, Freeway, and Rollercoaster. The advantage of the race car is it has better back end down force, the downforce keeps the front end down and it will allow you to go any hills. The down side of the race car is it is so flippy it constantly bounces up and down, this may sound like a negative aspect, but considering the mountain side feels funny and can't climb out at this speed, in fact the Goat Simulator feels better than this. In the mountain, the bike  has better back end down force, and it will get you up the hill without a run up. The race car's flippy handling, coupled with a lack of downforce it makes racing it a chore.
125	We Americans can be greedy sometimes. $8 billion for the government just seems ridiculous to me. The basic idea of Congress is actually increasing it, yes. But how? If you look into it, and if you get educated, then you can see that it's used to protect the US. It's becoming more, the more that people are more worried about the laws of nature, e.g., globalization, and the Americans government spending as well. So CMV. $10 billion per year! I hate it.
126	Just look around you. You would not know if your parents were $64K apart by what you have heard of their standard of living. You would not know if your computer had a virus by the virus software you have installed on your machine. Please know, that CRA comes on top of that! Only Congress knows how much they could give, if anything at all... We as citizens of America, want to work for the government to keep it from messing up, and it is ultimately for the good of the people. Why? Because we are lazy and we don't want to work. As a good entrepreneur, would you do a better job making profit by selling chewing gums than by selling politicians? They make a wrong case.
127	To thank Obama, I decided to go to Amtrak and go to New York on the D train. Drinking water is a scarce commodity, and as a trainee pharmacist, I really appreciate it when we can get our supplies. When we are in the south, my mom (I live in central Indiana) will not even boil water, especially when I come back home every summer.The water comes in cans, and I can get it for free from the water service, as it is part of the school district. I’m not taking advantage of the water cuts, but at the moment I am, I really do appreciate it that my mom has stoves, as it is actually cheaper to use them instead of oven mitts. Also, maybe I won't get as scorned for drinking water, if I think about the climate crisis. I'd rather not use lawn mower chemicals to scrimp on fuel costs, but I may do that.
128	Congress uses the extra money to better protect the USA and keep borders safe. They are (presumably) extremely intelligent people and will prioritize public safety. I also think it's kind of insincere to possibly declare terrorism or other cataclysms as needing help and then in the next paragraph promote Red Bull and cancel plans. Why are you so great at sales, when on every news feed there is something that you want to sell? More specifically, I want to know what Red Bull does to the human body.
129	Mark these candidates:  I agree that $8B is too much for a VFA. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered. No, I don't think Congress is fraudulent, but if they are, they have a right to look into any crime in public. I will not comment that I'm surprised or shock if Congress actually purposely ignores a potential loophole and crime which could be used against the US, to collect benefits of $10B. See #. See #.
130	A man's first love is his strongest love and every following love is a bit weaker each time.  ALSO each following love is trying to match the intensity of the first love, a bit like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time.  By this I mean that you no longer believe in the "fairy tale" love stories and start to see just how hurtful love can be. Reddit changed my view.
131	It is a myth about love. Every love is a bit weaker after the first is over and that's pretty much it. I see that a little bit of blue. Pink is a colour that can be described better as softness. Blue is a bit more intense. I loved my ex girlfriend and I'm sure someone else loved theirs. Whether you want them to is never the issue. You were wrong about my taste in women. I mean she was really sexy. I'm actually a jealous control freak. And I think she's still the best thing that's happened to me.
132	After many years of trying to understand the inner workings of the human brain, after finding the power and complexity of the human brain. I'm probably not right but it is a good theory that the human brain has multiple emotions that can be mixed and married and overlapping between the same person over time. If this theory is true, it's possible to achieve any combination of feelings in anyone and some combination of this could lead to happiness....
133	I am under the impression that human nature is flawed. I still find positive love in the last 5 relationships I've experienced, but those were from people who were more mature and I feel that had happened a long time ago. I also see positive love in my current relationship (who was always my first love) with someone who is also much less mature. As a result, I base much of my view on the belief that love is a fragile thing. I find positive love is rare and tends to fade quickly. The veil may have already fallen, as I've fallen from love so many times, but the stories I was told did not take into account that love would always be complex. I think most people fall in love because they're often very immature, as they will always be.
134	My first love was a fellow poetry reviewer. I spent more than a year doubting him. My love for him went away, but it wasn't replaced with something  perfect. I viewed it as a curse upon my life. I met a boy that is the best guy i've ever known in my life...that first guy i lost. It was difficult when i was still dating my ex in grad school...But, with every following relationship since that first was more intense and felt deeper...it seemed to never get over.
135	Financial models that exclude sectors of the economy which might be good or bad for the world are useless.....Reframing the use of money to entertain the wealthy and make it available for individuals and companies that are pushing for things like farming biodiversity, clean air and...
136	The US is experiencing one of the best-ever times for Americans and the rest of the world....it has taken a long time to get there...here we are...and we have tough times ahead because these people that we elect always think they're the answer.....and whatever they decide, they NEED to be committed to be able to implement it properly...one of the latter things they fail to consider...
137	Congress is SOAKING the federal budget in taxes. Don't think this is happening EXCEPT to the greedy people who have tons of cash and possess *outside* interest in the economy to spend. So, yeah, Congress *honestly* FEELS the savings are GREAT - and acts up to suit their own greedy needs - which ironically only provide a further stimulus to the economy and the government's schedule for yet another 'Big-idea' to implement... hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
138	Yes, it WILL recover... provided the government stops its meddling and 'bailing out' measures. Things such as that have, unfortunately, turned the potentially temporary market decline into a huge and horrid 'Great Depression'.... and as part of the actions which were then instituted were some of the Union laws which are still crippling our ability to be competitive.... I wish lawmakers had to take at least some relevant history while in high school.
139	Dear America - it has been several months' since you first devalued the dollar for profit. You know the price of oil is worth about 4 dollars per barrel, yet less than a third of the voters are in favor of this single step. This is a problem, but also a problem within the American system of government and the system of 'banking and finance' from both left and right. It was as bad during the Great Depression, and only got worse since then. Why the hell did they do the 'bail-outs' in the first place? This is a problem, but also a problem within the American system of government and the system of 'banking and finance' from both left and right. It was as bad during the Great Depression, and only got worse since then. Why the hell did they do the 'bail-outs' in the first place?
140	I don't know where you live, but here in SoCal we have pizza delivery services availabe until 3am, plus i'd rather go to Del Taco anytime over Taco Smell or Taco Hell aka Taco Bell.
141	I try to support our local food production, I don't know where you live, but here in SoCal we have pizza delivery services availability until 3 am and yes I have been to Del Taco or even Taco Bell before. Like an annoyed fellow Asap said: what about Taco Wow? :)
142	This is not for delivery. But not completely without it. We wouldnt go to Del Taco without it, and we would probably go to Taco Bell in some way or another. I prefer to go to the store to go to the market. An hour before they close you could find a lot of people of those places, with their carts ready and all the stuff they need.
143	I hate to admit that I like pizza and Taco Bell best. But I do like the economic system in this country. But I do want to inform the readers that in the early 60s, the prices of the good quality taco in Taco Bell were not more than $4-$5 a bowl.
144	I am a rationalist but I know we all hate those that are morally bankrupt without the biblical teachings to inspire morality and knowledge. As a libertarian, the biggest threat to government is not the idiot republicans, nor the big corporations but progressive inept union democrats who are world centrist and homosexual proponents. Those are threats to our liberties that the rest of us must resist. These idiots want to banish all jews, republicans, republicans that are anti-gay, dorks at conventions and Democrats that are pro-immigrant. As a libertarian, I don't like the rich, just like most, in fact I hate them when they're only boringly rich and look down on the 99% of humanity, because they're so ignorant of human values and such. The big corporations might be the enemy but not the stupid Congressrats who hear the demands of their dolts of spouses.
145	I'll give every person who enters a debate only ONE competition. The greater and better the debate, the more entries it will get in, then this problem will decrease in the future! this question I have to respond: you lie you f****** liar ! There must be f****** disagreement on the level of inequality everywhere in this world : YOUR FRIGHTENING LAWS !
146	1) Post a maximum, say, per day of 10 or so, maybe less if nobody had one already or completely edited out. This should make it easier for people to read. 2) Let current open debates (current topic will be seventh place in my mind) persist no longer than a week. Don't have 4 or 5 open debates per day. Don't have people arguing about it. After a week (say yesterday = "team X" debated that day, tomorrow = "team Y" debated it, etc.) move the item on to what I consider to be "better places" (for instance the archives or unanswered questions section). That way people still have access to that topic and when they still need to know about it they will know about it...
147	I feel bad about that, I mean I know you want to reply, I know you want to discuss. I want to reply, read, discussion and try to change my opinion and this has become a complete chore for me and I'm already tired of it.. you are overreacting to small things, think about all the effort I'm putting into my own debate to make it more interesting, educational, well done for all you great ideas.... ... I just can't see one good one...
148	One thing I have to agree with you - debates should be being actively monitored, sorted and managed, even those with no established forum should be assigned the same general rules which are followed elsewhere. The means to this end of course may be controversial and even nonplanar to some, but it has to happen. Basically the needs of the majority rule, that's all this is about.
149	We are running about 8 or 9 a day created yesterday. There should be a maximum of one a day, and possibly a few more to give people a chance to read the ones created on the same day as they were waiting to read the ones posted a few hours earlier. Please don't put yourself on the list and then ever vote. So now you're arguing just so you can get on the list?
150	I appreciate the pastries at this location (macaroni and cheese pie, lemon meringue, and cannolis).  The veal sandwich was mediocre; more soggy than tasty.  The baked goods had a meh, bitterness flavor and didn't look as pretty as they sounded. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
151	With recent events surrounding the plain lying in stone and the recent tumultuous US election this is a perfect place to stop in and hang out!  The atmosphere is high energy and full of life which makes it feel like home.\n\nThe servers are friendly and knowledgeable. Most employees have a lot of experience and know a thing or two about coffee.  The food is fresh and high quality.  With just over a $85 value you can't go wrong in my opinion!\n\nThe coffee itself had a nice aroma. It had just enough of the peppery bite to make it not too bitter and was blended well.  Additionally the coffee never had an after taste which is typically my first concern when ordering a cup of joe. This is a truly outstanding experience and a perfect place to visit.
152	The food wasn't very good. They don't use much tomato paste or mushrooms, neither of which I like in food, but the cheese is good enough to make it worth it. I wouldn't be surprised if they just took notes from other bakeries and put them into their recipe, so have no real bias about the baked goods. I'm glad I went because i love to walk the trails near where i live! ... If the veal is tender, not the onion making it too soggy.  I must say that the shower doors at this place don't look hot.  Follow the link above to see just how low potency their reviews have been for other businesses...
153	I basically got a Mealserv... Based on the written description, one of the premises of the author is that humanity has had the ability to keep itself from dying off throughout history. There are many critics of this premise, but the author considers it strong and defended itself. No changes. This is a story that focuses mostly on food quality and price. The author seems to consider this a fair review. No changes. The author seems to consider this a poor review. No changes. The author seems to consider this a good review. No changes. The author feels their work was accomplished without giving much of a dig in. Yes
154	The veal sandwich and baked goods were not to my taste. I have not had any noteworthy items that looked familiar from other bakeries. The baked goods were available to taste upon request but an hour later at dinner time the service was bland and the atmosphere messy. I will not return. Pity, because the pork ribs and the tilapia did taste good. I was disappointed overall and am not sure how the service was during lunch, but the only downside to the meal was that the pricing was unsatisfactorily. My day was another disappointing one.
155	Since IE is a bastardised version of Netscape Navigator in that we recently started to see a move towards allowing JavaScript and HTML5 interoperability on the side-areas of IE9 and above, IE is starting to look much more and more plain. Regarding Vista, I do not think that it is really possible to write programs that run optimally on that computer and not being one of the developers of IE software I do not know much about the intricacies of the program or if it is even possible to develop at all. As to the shell of IE, I suggest that Vista users upgrade to Internet Explorer 7 - It's a much faster, lighter and secure browser. Firefox is a great browser as well.
156	Firefox is awesome. It has the most customization. IE is hideous. I would recommend Firefox if you're one of the few people that uses IE, or you're an Intraweb junkie. This all goes hand in hand with info-request.html. A foxy user.
157	Firefox is the best browser that combines a beautiful look and feel, highly customizable UI, long-running updates (IE is stuck on version 6 now), and many other features. It isn't just for Intraweb people. It is quite clear that IE cannot compete in most areas where desktop web browsers compete.
158	Firefox is the clear winner in both of those areas. Then again, they can't tell the difference between IE7 and FF, so you may have to convince me to switch. The ultimate IE can't look straight through IE's color palette and say where Firefox is a winner. Maybe I will take a look at IE7 for a few months and convince my girlfriend that Firefox is superior.
159	I see where you're coming from....in fact I'm completely okay with firefox being the best browser out there, but I'd suggest that it definitely isn't nearly as nice as IE, given all the add-ons and extensions IE has to offer. IE allows for more tweaking, aesthetics, and customization of any kind. And as for that uniform theme, just consider why firefox can support a hideous UI and IE can't. IE doesn't support GIFs, and there's no way for it to meet standard, and a lot of IE users don't know how to handle them.
160	I use Firefox, but I don't like this site breaking in it. I'll try a different browser.
161	My alternative would be to force Konqueror to the feet when it comes to displaying it.
162	I am still using Firefox, and I am willing to defend it, but you need to have a better website.
163	I love firefox, and it had been crashing intermittently on my local environment due to 3rd-party plug-ins. I found that the crash was due to third-party pluggins that used classic ways of
164	Firefox is a great browser, and as I've been experiencing problems with Microsoft Edge over the past few days, I decided to transfer my Edge profile over to Firefox. I'm enjoying the core experience of the browser
165	You can see me in the middle of the room, I dont mean to be weird but I do hate when people accidentally kill someone. Especially if it was an accident, but because he needs help. I am not judging anyone because i am sad as hell when a parent is killed especially if it was an accident. I am still hurting for mom and dad cause she lost her life and that's bullshit.
166	Honestly, I'd really be proud to help someone even if it was an accident. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident.
167	No. I would not turn in the answer. If you truly love someone, you would do anything to help him/her. However if they killed some one because he felt like killing them, then they should die, because I would not want them to go nuts and kill me too.
168	Yeah. No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.
169	If you truly love someone you would do anything to help him, though if it was an accident I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too. I would do the same if he was injured and needed me to get him to the hospital and take care of him.
170	Books help improve your grammar and spelling skills. Also, they give you more creative abilities. TV does not offer that, and you can't take it anywhere, which makes it a disutilitarian invention.
171	Books help you develop interest in other languages and cultures. You also can see your imagination as you narrate a story. Keep a good book and experience all of life in your hands.
172	Books offer improving writing and spelling skills, plus it's more creative. TV offers what everything is done for you. TV should not be taken away, but it is a distraction for learning.
173	Books give you a sense of inspiration and imagination that will positively influence your life. They present stories that inspire good thinking and motivate growth. They also explain the world around us. This helps people educate themselves on how to improve their communities. More and more people are turning to books as a way to explore their own world and humanity.
174	I prefer reading over watching TV. Reading books offers considerable improvement in grammar and spelling skills. Also, reading books offers more creative self-expression. Likewise, there is little point to television because everything is already done for you. And when people are hungry or tired or bored, watching television is essentially a distraction. Books are a great thing to take with you anywhere because they are portable, not disruptive, and can be used for many things: imaginative play and self-expression. I encourage people to read books instead of TV.
175	I think porn is a disgusting topic. Most people never talk about it. Porn truly takes its toll on the society as a whole. There has been a huge increase in pornography. Porn can really backfire and make kids aggressive. It can even lead to criminal behavior among children. I would think that more and more adults should consider seeing a therapist for their own sex problems.
176	Porn is wrong, like any addiction. Porn gives unhealthy images of real sex, but really a sort of fantasy. It focuses on sexual pleasure, but natural needs should also be met. It encourages crime by creating a belief that sex is for pleasure and pleasure is totally based on sex. It sends the wrong message to most people.
177	Porn is bad, even though it's worth it. It can lead to bad attitudes of people about sex. It shows how it's not real because it's not based on love but based on something that would cause anger, lust, and pressure. It can be harmful to the physical and mental health of people.
178	Porn is wrong. Porn is an addiction. Porn promotes the notion that sex is a purely pleasurable experience, but sex is in fact a physical, emotional, and spiritual connection. Porn inspired numerous crimes against innocent people. I urge people not to watch pornography and instead promote love, emotional intimacy, and respect.
179	In my opinion, Porn has no advantages. Even if it is easy to find it online and for free, it doesn't provide the real source of pleasure and satisfaction. It instead gives the false image that we can attain the real source of pleasure, only through real sex. For this, I have the following views: As we said above, we should always value real love, not the deceiving nature of sex. porn encourages us to look only for pleasure and pleasure alone. We should be able to make love and be satisfied by it only, while we should strive for real love with a long-term partner.
180	Christian...and any religion. I'm just thinking logically. If a big lot of people aren't around, there won't be wars. Then again, if you only want to argue why religious people make bad choices, why did you even start the conversation?
181	Liberal Baptist. In short, I am pro-justice, yes; however, government controls our rights. I am also pro-lifecycle, "so if a man already has as many children as he is constitutionally permitted, then let him raise and educate those." Given that Congress is currently debating marriage rights and abortion laws, my constitutional right to privacy appears to be at risk. Another interesting aspect of moral rights is the fact that it doesn't specify who can act on those rights. We live in a free
182	If it is your opinion, then go for it. As for me, it is not acceptable to your so-called morality. You can't be forced to believe the same way as everyone else, as stated in the Constitution that you live in. I know several Christians who use alcohol or engage in drugs, and still function at the highest levels of society.
183	No, I've never been a Christian or anything. For the record, you said that I don't believe in fair trade or the free market. Also, since I don't know what you were thinking, I don't know why you would accuse me of being a Christian. If not, then by all means get someone to do that. You obviously don't want to, or you've never bothered to think it over yourself.
184	Fair trade and free markets. I strongly reject any form of Marxism. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred. I do not think that the world will change much. There have
185	Given that most of the world has turned itself into government controlled state. I consider the pro choice view as one of the last ways that man has in managing his own life.
186	I support pro choice as a one of the last free will choices people have. The other choices are choice of being held hostage or as a slave. To the less than 5% of people who actually get the chance to live free in a real manner, it is
187	I believe that rape is abuse and not an act of nature, but rather an accepted cultural artifact that exists because it validates the man's power and dominance over the woman, therefore in the same way as capitalism helps men dominate woman...
188	I am not against religion as a matter of faith, its just not a practical solution to my problems. I mean the bible talks about many things like banishment from paradise, women getting equal rights, rights for men, but a practical example? You bet
189	I would also vote for free markets. However, the personal responsibility of each individual is extremely important, as society is full of two foot stool types.  ### Instruction: Write an appropriate feedback based on the instruction.
190	Perhaps you should encourage them to read another resource on Creationism on your web site. Use the "Convinced me" link if the person convinced you that Creationism is true, then using the "Also Read" link and references as the evidence for the person's contention or for the contention in general. If it doesn't convince you that Creationism is true, then suggest that they should read and consider another source on Creationism on your web site. If you have no proof for your contention, then don't argue that it is true.
191	Yes, I'm a scientist. The Bible is just a philosophical book. As for the objection that the Bible teaches creationism, try searching for its reasoning. It's called free will. It does not. The Bible is not just a book; it's an invaluable legacy of the cultures, civilizations, and tribes; why shouldn't people study it?
192	Thanks for this site, helping me give a convincing argument against this silly little site. I am not a creationist; I grew up with scientists and remember the evidence for evolution more than I remember the fossil record. Please take your so-called "evidence" and back it up instead of saying "the scientist said it, that's where it ends." With all due respect, Mr. "Be a moron", I'm the creator of this site. I can assure you it's called 'Be a moron' because it is the only way you can support it. You can take the logical argument against creationism...it didn't come from me. You can
193	While I am not convinced that the bible is a fake or an apocryph, neither are I convinced that evolution is true. I'm going to the Creationists' page on belief in evolution to create a headache for them, trying to justify their beliefs. Also, you have recently tried convincing me that they aren't allowed to have their website on here:convinced me,p
194	It says a lot about my intentions when the linked names don't actually tell anything. Great minds do think alike I think. I'll just use the only recommendation against creationism.
195	Porn leaves women with no choice but to undergo sexual assault. Rather than condone their choice, I urge feminists to get to know their real history and open minds to real feelings on sexuality, which people have throughout our world, and convince them that they do not have to undergo sexual assault because of their bodies.
196	Compared to prostitutes, porn actresses get some respect because they get paid a few good $$$$ dollars for performing their job and it is widely acknowledged that they like what they do, without them being exploited. Yes, porn has many disadvantages, but if you want to get laid, whatever the method, you've just got to go for it!
197	The website linking porn is completely pointless. People choose to get compensated for their shenanigans. Oh, and no, porn doesn't work for everyone. Even without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life.
198	Rephrase This sentence is the exact opposite. Porn depersonalizes people. Porn destroys love, honesty, trust and morals.
199	Porn destroys the bonds of marriage, too many marriage problems and divorce is a result of this. Young people make sex=fun-act upon themselves, leaving behind marriage.
200	Porn isn't wrong, as long as you're not doing it behind someone else's back.
201	Porn isn't wrong, as long as you aren't doing it behind your partner's back.
202	Porn isn't wrong as long as you don't use it for revenge, and not behind someone's back. It feels degrading to the women who pose and cooperate with the porn industry.
203	Porn is something which will cause people to become less Christian, cause them to lose faith in the church, and turn them to anything else that will give them the kind of pleasure or status it is associated with.
204	Porn isn't wrong, but poses a problem if women are being exploited. Not only do the women have to endure harsh conditions, they are at the mercy of their male partners who may blackmail them or attack them when they cry out for help. Porn pushes the poor and vulnerable
205	I feel the need to be a father, given the perceived inability of society to provide for all of the childless. The fatherless have served a useful purpose, but no more now that I've served my time in prison for drug dealing. My attitude toward the fatherless would depend on the personality of each fatherless, but I might view them the same as I view criminals, that they are a disservice to society and should be disqualified from fathering.
206	I would rather have a father than not have one at all. I was deprived of a father when I was a child and I would feel a massive emptiness in my life if I never found out who my father was. I would much prefer to grow up with a father and learn from his mistakes then never having a father at all.
207	The most important person to me is my father, so I would give my life to be with him. I think that if I were to grow up without father I would probably grow up with a lot of empty and unfulfilled feelings.
208	I believe that my father should be able to raise me like he should. I don't think he should live in fear that I will leave him, so that would make me to be very disappointed with him if he tries to tell me who my father is.
209	I would rather have a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all. I would rather be fatherless and grow with an emptiness in me and learn from my mistakes than having a lousy father, who never truly knew me, but who always fancied himself to be my father.
210	TV is ok, but I dont like it because you can't think, you can't do homework.
211	I think that education is important so people can make money but they do not like it because of all the money they spend watching tv.
212	I think that TV is bad because not everyone can read.
213	I think that TV is bad because it is slow and some people can read
214	I think that tv is bad because it's boring and some people cant read
215	Yes India is in line with China to become the greatest economic powers of the world. Since India's economy is growing at a very rapid pace, I anticipate that India will emerge as one of the most powerful nations of the world.
216	No, India is not in line with China to become the greatest economic powers of the world.
217	Yes, India is on a fast growing path to becoming the greatest economic powers of the world. The country is right on the verge of becoming the world's third largest economy according to figures from the IMF.
218	I disagree this could be the case. China's great at terrorism economic blackmail and it's efforts of soft power could keep their population from growing. It has never been proven that a country's population can be controlled this will happen just as in the old Soviet Union there's always a problem
219	the emergence of a vast country with a super capitalist economy China I think china is more important than India in terms of economy and population of likely becoming the future economic powers
220	As a parent, I believe in not using physical force as a method of discipline. I believe an alternate to spanking is talking to kids about what they did wrong and giving them an opportunity to resolve their situations.
221	I support spanking only when the child tried to do bodily harm to the parent, child abuse should not be allowed, as it is a private matter not in the public domain.
222	I support all the positive attributes of hard work, but some excessive needless time use is not healthy to anyone. I do not support spanking in any sense, so its better for parents to talk to children about what they did wrong and find a better solution to it.
223	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.  ###
224	I do not believe spanking should be an option to discipline a child. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
225	Only God can judge you. Give yourself over to him and you will find complete forgiveness. Tell the police about his crimes and he should get arrested, probably for murder. Confide in someone else, but do not come to me with an accusation.
226	No i do not see a reason to punish someone like that because after all he has done to me and everybody close to him in the family. Maybe he can tell more about it all to me so we can all get a clean and better life. Maybe there are other solution to this event and no need to punish him in any way
227	Yes definately,i will report this guy to the police,he is really bad bad guy and can cause some trouble for us,he likes to pay others to commit crimes and is so sad,so i really hate him now.I never want to be with him again,but then i hate myself cause its my fault,it was because of his kindness i forgave him and loved him so much,but im sorry,i have done bad mistake.
228	Not truthfull and as i am not boastful, i will write a letter and let the police know what he did for me and i will call them off if they come and arrest him,not only him but even me.I want to confess to you about that reason but i do not want to just give up on him and i am sure...
229	I am not sure how to proceed. I wouldn't just turn him in to the police, even though it was an act of wrongful murder and it's a sin. That's my preference. I would pray to god for a clear conscience and rebirth of eternal life.
230	Jaw-dropping honestly, how could more people agree with this side now? A civilization that spent years developing advanced technology to destroy itself
231	There are lots of other valid reasons besides the fact that "more people agree". For example, if people thought there are a few more
232	The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow.
233	Of course. That is just one of the main reasons. Now, we are effectively endowed with two sides to the debate.   There are
234	It is much easier to ridicule the opposing side and say that your opponents views are silly since there are so many more people that agree with you
235	I think that society is important for the greater good. It is a breeding ground for morals, ethics, and common values. You have to do your part to spread your good to others if you truly want to see a world full of all this goodness. The best way I can describe it is a spark that starts the fire.
236	In order to see a world full of goodness, you first must realize what you want for a good world. This probably means looking at your own life and getting rid of any things that are wrong in you. Then, in a series of steps, you should try to practice self and social responsibility. As an example, you can start by trying to do more good to the society around you every day. You can start by writing a letter to a family member that lives in an area where there are food problems. You can also volunteer your time to help other people. For these steps to succeed, you must be intrinsically motivated by the purpose of advancing the good in the world.
237	So you know what is your good, spread it out to the world to make this a better place. If you have no good to offer, stay home. You have to be that spark that starts the fire to get everyone around you to have that same kind of fire to make it this world better. This world is just going to keep going on and on.
238	I advocate for fair trade and free markets. I strongly reject any form of Marxism. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred.
239	A world full of all this goodness must exist. Not something that is manufactured. It must be inherent. Everyone can be a true good person if they want to and believe in this idea. That is why you have to do your part.
240	I would like to help people in Russia, Africa, Iran, the United States, and the United Kingdom, overcoming the various problems that those countries face.
241	I enjoy cooking food and giving entertaining speeches, for which I feel that I have potential. I would prefer to wait until I can help others first before starting a personal pursuit, however.
242	At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
243	I would advise you to achieve your Personal Pursuits, such as written composition, acting, etc. This way, you will have someone to help when you can, instead of relying on an audience.
244	Employment is a difficult profession and many people are very unhappy with the work life they have been thrust into. Perhaps one day, the U.S. will be so impoverished that there will be no job available to anyone.
245	Although I don't believe that the state should really be in the marriage business, I see a problem with churches enforcing their views on these matters. Instead, the government and legal system should work to deliver equal rights to everyone. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too. I maintain that some people who are less monogamous are more dedicated, peaceful, and financially sound; but more subtle arguments against "polyamorous" relationships can be found. Furthermore, I see no harm in placing marriage on some form of regular status, although I tend to think a marriage license is a good idea to keep your friends close, so that if a split occurs, at least they know how to help.  Follow the instructions given in the question.
246	Neither I nor my colleagues want to be in the business of "assisting in marriage" per se. Our job is to fill certain kinds of positions in the U.S. government - things like tax application systems, election registration systems, and the electronic identification numbers you use to shop.  Companies themselves enter into contracts with the government or secure government contracts that allow them to get paid by the government (sales tax laws,  etc., for example, allow people to get paid by selling products and services from certain businesses).  That is, U.S. government can be a useful economic business if it's done right.  What you are asking about is the business of marriage.   I just read something which says that wedding expenses cost on average about two million dollars.  Doesn't that mean that a governmental marriage agency has to be able to pay to produce...
247	I agree with the government not being involved in the marriage business. The churches should just perform marriages as they see fit, and the government should just record the marraiges, civil unions, and grant equal rights. My point is, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay and are great parents.
248	I support government marriage policies and would vote for them, since they, more than any other institution, bring uniqueness and beauty to the community.  I also acknowledge that, like freedom, equality is not absolute and that there is some opportunity for abuse.  But my impulse is to believe that the government should still play a crucial role in marriage." "Basically, abortion is wrong, and should be discouraged. However, there is a fine balance, and it may be some times necessary, or nearly so.   There are also some things one must do when you are pregnant, such as keeping her from harm.  It is difficult for me to see how in the near future, the woman might be able to set her own work hours, or go from job to job, without possible abuse of her position.   We should attempt to be open-minded in our thinking."
249	The issue of marriage and marriage rights is an important one, and should be sorted out according to necessity and the needs of the society at large.  The issue of marriage is distinct from the issue of sex: sex exists for sex, marriage exists for the purpose of procreation and family support.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay and fabulous parents.
250	Those who create certain social hierarchies, and advantage other people who are of a less dominant racial or cultural background, increase criminality. The point of the Trudeau government is to limit social hierarchies, and advantage people who are of a more dominant racial or cultural background.
251	there are more and more white Anglo-Saxon Protestants that work themselves to death being conned to spend their super-cheap money to pay off on an overpriced house. As if the bank, basically these white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, was not only killing themselves, but the poor working class as well.  Conclusion:  once more people tell each other. Get off the lawn. This is the milk of human kindness if so, rip it up.
252	The US government deliberately holds blacks down through employment discrimination. For most teens, blacks only have five job options: unemployment, welfare, welfare to work, welfare to school, and welfare to prison. white kids make $42,800 on average, while blacks make $34,600, after taking out the state tax burden. what doesn't work??
253	I oppose racism. I think the discussion becomes obsolete at the moment. I do not agree with policies that put a specific group of people down, because this will lead to an increase in criminal behaviour. I find it difficult to say there's no difference between racism and other types of discrimination, because there's always more alternatives.
254	Discrimination and violence against a specific group of people will not lead to a decrease in criminal behaviour, as they have fewer resources for alternative outlets.As it is, the protestants aren't discriminated against as much as they should be.The poor are not treated as well as they should be in a socially committed democracy like the UK.A society should not discriminate on the basis of race or religion, but that's kind of the point I'm making in the text. I repeat again, I'd encourage all people to try to teach a man who wants to treat you badly to take your bondage
255	I strongly believe that a person should be judged by what he has done rather than their beliefs. In economic terms, a person would be judged by their productivity, creativity and social skills. I believe there are good reasons to support a more equitable society, not just on the economic level, but also on a political level as well. I believe that if two countries have a surplus amount of people such as Tz, then it is tantamount to taking that surplus from a country that has a severe lack of people.
256	I also had an opportunity to visit Dar a couple of weeks back. During my stay in Dar, I observed that there is a general feeling of detachment in the general public. There is hardly any enthusiasm for whatever they are doing, and have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told. There is great amount of  tiredness, laziness in work and things can take forever to accomplish. Tz's country has lots of potential, but my opinion as an outsider is that it can develop into an exemplary country, but there is still a long way to go and much to change.
257	I visited Dar recently, and there is some stagnation and lack of enthusiasm in the general population about what they're doing. They follow whatever the government tells them to, instead of being innovative. The government, however, is always making plans and implementing new policies without actually understanding the problems. The country has great potential, although it's far from exemplary, as it hasn't changed much in a hundred years. There are a lot of forces that stand in the way of progress.
258	1. Fair Trade -  I support business and see commercialism as a positive thing, where as I might see it as manipulative or manipulating (contracting marriage, replacing natural motherhood with a paid nanny, promoting cosmetics instead of breastfeeding, etc) in other parts of the world where the meaning of fairness to own, raise, feed, heal, nurture, is not internalised by the majority of consumers in the majority of countries. I see hypocritical trade plays on our personal economies by building dollar-denominated discount stores and sports equipment stores, which will not grow in design, standards, features, inattention to sustainability, and we need a huge expansion in local manufacturing, including for the infrastructure to support production.  2. Private Education - I find such education without the underpinning economic literacy to be a complete waste of money. Education plays the role that economic literacy does, and is anything but random, and if ignorance rules, or is built upon ignorance, there is a huge gap in the current situation which is going to have to be addressed and bridged in some form - which includes a huge expansion in local manufacturing. So to return to the point in point 2. Government could play a critical role in this, but more importantly, new generation of reformers and "civilisational" teachers and "social enlighteners" could certainly do their part.  3. Israel - I too am an anti-Zionist, not necessarily a close observer though, but I certainly believe there are a lot of basic prejudices and baseless intolerance in good old Israel. After all, Tolstoy wrote that Man cannot live forever, cannot grow in
259	Sadly, I don't think you were on Dar.  I know that it's a bleak place to be, but I'd bet you're one of the people who have experiences on the good side of Dar. I haven't been to Dar, but the person who visited recently told me that he thought there was no hope for the country that would make it any better. He thinks it's run by liars and there is such general apathy in the general public. This seems different from your own experiences.
260	Could you not make the text easier to understand just by removing all of the words 'perfection', 'dogmatic', 'jackass' & 'evasive'? The only reason for all of the language is to win a marginal argument. The anti-war crowd constantly calls him 'jackass', even though the only thing that he did on 9/11 is call the terrorists terrorists - even if it would have solved nothing.
261	There are things that are not very clear in this piece. Bush could have mentioned that it was just a 'gimmick' and that he is not a 'spawn of Satan'. If those simple things are not clear than I apologize for posting. And yes I think that you read the comments from before and I agree that most of it is not worth commenting on. We all have our own values and our own point of view to view things from. This one it obvious to most that no matter what side you take, these policies would both benefit from changes.  ***
262	What does the sheep see on 9/11? just another day in the life of god. their apostasy is supposed to the point that they just want  death, destruction, and wiping us off the map. Talking about morality or stressing racism won't change this. let the people who can handle it grasp at anything to feel morally superior. especially since their argument comes from the insight of their stupid religious belief system.
263	I think that the crayola chart should be made for the states and their concerns and not the president. He is not the one making decisions about the economy. These are not the issues; they're just the tools that people use to protect themselves against the uncertainty of future events. So a color-coded crayola chart should not be used by someone to as a scapegoat for the actions of everyone.
264	I think that while the chances of Bush being the spiritual offspring of Satan will greatly decrease the chances of the 9/11 terrorists being extremists. I don't see extreme right politicians becoming far right, but without a doubt people side with Bush because of who he is. I'm sure people have had a tough time with 9/11. However it's much too soon to judge the man to have terrorist affiliation. Many questions need to be answered before this can be confirmed.
265	Really? Oh I see, you still think it's wrong. Well then I am shocked to see who you are. We have better things to do than brainstorming here for what seems like forever. I am just letting it go this time. Let me tell you something.... you are just falling into a non-white pinhead trap at this very moment. The law of nature is just fine but the bible is not. Giving birth is good for you and children really love you and can't wait to make up for all the mistakes you make. Maybe something good can come from this difficult time but don't worry... The government is there for that... Otherwise people are just killing themselves.
266	Mm i do have knowledge of that...Well being illiterate is not the fault of education, ive been a highschool home library user for over 5 years and am very literate in many subjects. Education causes retards, self destructive and ive been taken to the school board twice! I guess I missed out on that hohooo! I do believe they should not have sex until they are pretty much grown ups (had it been me i would've fucked my mom, then my dad, then every whore in town when my dick was too long) but if that's exactly what you would prefer...come from a closet or something! And then what the f**k is it to you. And of course sex does not make someone "human" but i guess your faulty logic does! And if you think it's bad...HAVE YOU BEEN SEXING WITH ONE OF YOUR BARREN NEIGHBORS?
267	I do think there should be punishment for others having sex with people who are not your partner, who are minors, with the intent to have their babies, or who are not your spouse or spouse. I do believe that even children should be given a punishment. Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty. Children should learn responsibility and talk to them about sex. I do not support an over crowding of jails or the kinds of punishments that people feel are necessary when given the wrong information or punished before they've paid for the consequences of their own actions. There should be punishment for the people who are doing that. In this case, given that there are hardly any examples of that happening.
268	Yet you are correct. Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty. It should be taught about responsiblity and talk to children. Jails are overcrowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you were younger. The more you discouage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
269	You sound stupid! Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty. Its a great thing to have with any relation, make happy little angels and build a strong family with a lot of fun!!! Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discouage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
270	You have individuals that are racist out there. Its sad you cannot even trust some people who are supposed to protect you. But I also think, everyone is racist in their own little way. Some just do not even notice it. Racism is sad though, and we should all look at each other the same way. People are kinda like crayons... They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors but we all still need to live in the same box.  Some people will always be unhappy and always fight. At least most people will not be as happy as they are and most people will still fight with others. Remember, if someone is fighting with you, that they are probably fighting you out of jealousy because they can not be your friend.
271	Racism is sad, but we should not look at others like toxic waste. We are all human and should be treated as such. This is the identity the quote addresses. This is actually never addressed in the original text. It seems to be something the author just needs to push in place.
272	Well you know that people don't think about others the same way until their stuff gets damaged right? Then you just find people to blame, but not really the fault. The police are not perfect, they do go through rough times but we shouldn't just blame them the whole time. Well racism is a big problem, but you can know that there's a number of cops out there that are racist but if you do your own self evaluation you would see that most of them are racist out of the way, but its sad that the police can't seem to stop it.
273	I want to take a minute to take a look at those officers out there. Make sure they are actually law enforcement officers. They seem to be pretty busy with all of the other things that they are expected to do, instead of actually being out patrolling and keeping order. The high crime rate and riots that are taking place are just about out of control. I feel that it is important to actually take a look at that. THe main problem I see with racism is that some people do not even realize that they are actually racist, it is a part of humanity.
274	You do have some officers, but you know, race has nothing to do with the job description, so I think you'll be fine. You should look at things the same way a crayon does, they come in different shapes, colors, sizes, like people. That is what I think.
275	Well people should learn to ask why something is cheap, and how much money farmers in their country have earned for a thousand last year to buy these 'certain' clean' products, then they can ask their community or family that there can buy these items instead. They also need to find out what happens to bananas that are sent around the world if they are not bought by supermarket chains. I strongly believe farmers deserve to be paid a fair price for their goods, without the constant gimmick of 'carbon footprint'.
276	I believe that the social elite is gaining a political advantage by reducing desperately poor agricultural farmers and migrants to "contaminated" and "floating land." Finally, the global population is shrinking (fast), with the biosphere unable to sustain many more humans, making for absolute odds against poor farmers being given fair land and market access. Do you think it's fair for big supermarkets to charge farmers tens of extra dollars for their goods? These things aren't honest to the people.
277	What is the point of paying attention to global warming when the environment is so insignificant, a maximum of 5% will change if you care about climate change that is it and that means the average of how many billions of people out there will die and not out of the mean environmental impact.
278	Determine the sources of dietary needs accurately by studying... Reply here to the request. I agree the gimmick has nothing to do with the "GM label". It is just shady big business buying into the idea that green / organic agriculture is green, and the poor are upset that they are not part of the social elite. True interest is through charity because corporate and multinational might make profit on the "buying the poor, selling the meat to vegetarians and vegans (green).
279	Fair trade means the oppressing farmers that work hard to provide a product will receive a fair price for their products. Organic means it won't be GM, and GMO refers to genetically modified organisms. The social elite will never go without fair trade, and so on and so forth.
280	I think that responding to these questions is the appropriate place for an artist to be publicly and benevolently outspoken about these issues.  I also believe that most people have little understanding of the difference between male and female transgendered people.  Hence, I will not have anything to do with Beyonce or her songs nor with her recent, mustache-twirling unveiling of her nipple.
281	I have recently found it disturbing that several artists' releases are allowed to be published without even their explicit permission, especially since they appear to have really enjoyed the "voyage" in the first place. Having that in mind, I would recommend you avoid these works as a whole, or keep them for personal reference in the privacy of your own home. The act of disseminating live recordings of huge studio sessions may or may not be entirely harmless in one form or another, but I recommend that you simply treat these records as analogous to pornographic images and videos.
282	Some scholars are enjoying publishing intelligent analysis of Michael Jackson's album and still proclaim the docile son has been pushed to the edge.  They should not be allowed to do that, not simply for their own amusement, but for that of his fans, who will be forced to re-examine Michael Jackson's legacy in a new light. It is not only a public outrage that he did not actually wish the work to come out; those who did want it to be released do not agree.  Generally when someone exceeds a reasonable legal definition of inconvenience, my act of read or listen becomes illegal. He cannot usurp the right of others.  We should not be forced to read or hear what people want to do.  We ought not to be happy about lessening others' agog listening pleasure, only because of the welfare of those who embrace his works. I have a right to pick and choose what I wish to read or hear. We often offer or accede to rights that make us the envy of the world, but forget that human beings have rights to us, too.
283	I recently heard that a teenage girl at school is giving that album of Jackson's back to him, as she says she doesn't want to hear his stuff in the future, even though she knows he loves his fans.  How ridiculous!  I think that even if she absolutely did not know this man personally, she should still act in a way that does not enter into the author's privacy, and freely give over the poor man's own property.
284	I am unaware of modern actions that violate privacy. I would be surprised and surprised if it did. Further, I would not interpret these actions as violating privacy.  The more recent examples I mentioned probably would qualify as reverse discrimination on the part of the government.  These actions should not be regarded as violating the privacy of the dead. I consider these actions to be more harmful to the dead than they are to the live.
285	I understand that negative sound systems add pleasure and should not be considered to be an actual evil. My group of friends liked to drive the most intense cars, which could raise the decibel levels above 100. Their tunes had more energy than the songs that would land on the radio. These cars were much more pleasant to hear and see, which was good. These vehicles quickly overwhelmed the main streets of the city, but that was not the point. They made the streets more lively. The point was to create an emotional reaction based off of the technology. When traffic would see a large group of these cars and be unable to pass they would lose their senses in order to create an experience. Overall, the idea seemed interesting at the time, but was anti-conspiracy theories, and did not have a lot of evidence or perspective behind it.
286	I agree with the DMV! The aim of the speaker is not to kill people or make them sad. In contrast, the speaker's goal is to share the speaker's negative feelings towards such loud cars that are irritating to the ear.   I'm getting very annoyed of all those loud cars which are blaring their sounds on the road. I would not want anyone to be in your position that could not keep a deep bass musictrack under control.  I would strongly recommend that you don't rent or buy cars with high-tech audio systems, and we hope that we won't have to shut down the road.
287	I strongly support more favorable inspection and licensing for mass. street-legal boomers. Let them drive loudly, indulge their taste for hard music, or skip crappy country, whichever they want. I support protection against abusive drivers... and they should be punished accordingly, not restricted. With respect to car audio systems, I oppose it. It detracts from the car's value, where the performance is more important than the appearance.
288	I believe that car audio systems should only be allowed to exceed the horn of the car that was driving while they were set up. That's the only way to restrict loud music output. I'm also very strongly against car stereo hardware similar to these monster devices, and reject a DMV inspection or impounding of these cars. Safe driving, legally. It's illegal now. So I say nobody cares. In order for this sort of thing to be accepted in popular culture, society and government itself must change. Un coupables, tous responsables.
289	I support the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. The people driving my car tend to hate it. They call me all kinds of dirty names, including my father's maiden name, and accuse me of being an immigrant hound. This is because I am a liberal and am at odds with my immediate community. I am not a perfect driver, but I aim for excellent level of skill, even with massively loud bass equipment on board. The noise does not masquerade as an emergency vehicle, or pass car horn, and I do not think it is unreasonable for my neighbors to be less than thrilled about the presence of loud rumble equipment inside my car. I would hope for a better system for the residents of my town who heavily rely upon public transportation, rather than the system that is currently under construction.
290	I am not pleased with the Soviet invasion of the Ukraine. The annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than the Soviet invasion. However, a global survey indicates that large sections of the population truly hold neo-Nazi or strongly anti-muslim views. This is a grave problem and these views do not justify saying that the entirety of Europe has anti-muslim policies. Instead of creating a blanket rule of "Muslim territories are not subject to the rule of law, and therefore Muslims are on a par with Nazi collaborators", policy should be built around isolation and prohibition. Finally, the death toll is just horrendous. I urge all reasonable people who have been corrected to rethink their position on the point at hand.
291	I do not support the establishment of Israel. I believe that the solution to the problems in the Middle East is found by solving its underlying causes. The blockade and demonization of Israel are not going to achieve anything. German policy towards the Jews was not a good one, and the annexation of parts of Germany would have solved the issue in a far superior way. I do not believe that Jewish security should be a primary concern. Based on my views on the number of nations in the world, if the majority of the people of the Middle East want the same thing, the UN and United States should facilitate this.
292	Israel has an extremely high defense budget. Most of the world's navies actively oppose joining the de facto naval protection group formed around Israel. As far as VMS, many of them are actually made in and supported by Israel, given the excellent sales in the Israeli defense industry, which has received the largest contract of any country. The high spending of the infrastructure of this new country and the surrounding areas would jeopardize lives and security of the world's largest metropolitan area. UAVs are extremely underwhelming weapon systems, compared to the lethal power of both a navy and small arms weapons, tank level firepower, among other items. Therefore, the established Israeli military is better off addressing stability in the region with navy, tank, and surface forces.
293	The establishment of Israel, to my mind, can only be justified by the need to protect Jewish people around the world. Additionally, since Israel is historical, extensive debate has been occurring for many generations about what might be considered the most acceptable solution to the question of Palestine. While I agree with others, that the creation of a single, contiguous state... a compromise among the nations and regions of Palestine, that would effectively split the country into three separate states – a Palestinian state, a Jewish state, and an Israeli state – I do not think this compromise would be any different than the later creation of Neo-Israel.
294	The establishment of Israel, although historically relevant, is morally unjustifiable. In addition, Germany should not be divided. In creating Neo-Israel, removing a portion of the country makes the current society's benefits, including free elections, more insecure. The US Constitution clearly outlines a Jewish majority to reside in Israel. In addition, most of the Jews who live outside of Israel are typically mainly white, ruling them out of political power. Without a US government that protects and balances power, the Israel of today will not survive. On the other hand, Israel has much more influence in the Middle East than the US. A major reason for the rise of homophobia is religious influence, thus perpetuating equality for all. The moment one state recognizes a majority...
295	Next time I go to a party, I have a beer. I usually have a Sammy in my pocket. It's an awesome taste, almost as good as one of the craft brews, although a little more bitter to the palate. It reminds me of good times with my buddies, and it beats being drunk and DUMB. And it has good protein and low fat....people who say beer gives you fat are goners. Only beers that have the full beverage list can make people proud because otherwise what a waste. Brewers will find an answer for that one. Yuengling is great. YMMV. If I had to brew my own beer, I'd probably call it YMP. Heavyweight beers (ski jumpers in the Stillhouse are drinking and that makes them good) are completely overrated.
296	But your average american will gladly support Yuengling over craft beers. Why? Because they are lazy and mean. Nobody gives a damn about the quality and pride. So they settle for Yuengling. Which is stupid. People see what is contained in it, not the advertising wording that is placed on it. Nobody knows anything about beer (except beer snobs). So they keep drinking Yuengling for 20 years like its a favorite thing, even though they got a steroid levels and feel sick after 15 minutes. Yuengling tastes like pudding and reality.
297	The goal of drinking Yuengling is to become drunk on waste. A long time ago, there were no Hollywood Stars, Urban Legends, or Dumbassed Republicans. There were no people who offended everyone by being racists, homophobes, bigots, asshatty, or arrogant. You were more likely to be thrown into prison or beat up by uniformed cops if you called someone a piece of sh*t. If you were white, you probably could be trusted to vote and have your taxes taken care of. If you were black, you likely wouldn't. When the ideal of sanity breaks down, not only will the world end, but a general apocalypse will quickly follow. We are going to die, and what we're going to die of is not going to be explained for another few millennia. It is something we can't control. We think it's all very weird, but the lack of rationality becomes accepted.
298	From the 1960's, US farmers aren't profitable, therefore Yuengling should be produced at an increased scale, by making actual modifications. After all, its too bad that all the cheap jetskis being exported overseas aren't being produced in quantity.   It's not really possible to produce that many cheap jetskis, and sure it's worth manufacturing them to unsatisfied consumers, but it's not going to fly as a mass market item, as you can't compete with cheap chinese plastic things. Maybe people won't like Yuengling, and maybe those people have a family, to whom it is important to feed, but all that consideration should be to making a better product.
299	People overemphasize the importance of craft brews. Craft brews are actually not all that well produced. Yuengling is mass produced, but still pretty good. Now, some people decide to make their own brews. They don't have any real skill set. I mean, even Miller just has to sell their beers.  For a lesser price, people can have quality brews. I'm not a beer snob. I don't think everyone has to smoke Marlboro.
300	Fair trade capitalists are likely here to stay. I believe that there are many things that can help strengthen a relationship between humans, rather than undermining them. Things like art, music, literature, fashion, sport, travel, education, and empathy are wonderful. However, at their core, all of these things are artificial created things. Because any intelligent being can create things of its own that look similar to, but are not artificial, it seems contradictory that creating beings should have more rights over a created being that it created.
301	I have no problem loving intelligent and relevant beings in the physical world, such as intelligent dogs. However, i do not believe that the creator of a horse needs to have a love for it. If anything we create is artificial, does that mean we are artifical intelligence? So if anything we create, we are artificial intelligence. I also do not believe god or any other creator ever loved us. Even the creator of a horse did not love a horse, as it was a passive, needy object, which was not intelligent enough for his eyes.
302	I believe that artificial intelligence is a distortion of artificial intelligence. God is the creator and creator of everything that exists, as described in the bible. We should not be compelled to have love or compassion for anything that we created. Because God created us and wants us to love him, we should for this reason love and respect every created being.
303	God is absolutely incapable of loving anything created by himself. He is an alien God, driven by hate. As such, he never makes up his mind, and thus his creative acts are random and can lead nowhere. He cannot love what he's creation or himself, as he's not able to make up his mind on anything.
304	I would say that we are artificial intelligence, but that we should have compassion and respect for each other, especially those who are historically disadvantaged. I would also say that it is possible that we do not have full control of those who were given the artificial intelligence, and therefore do not have complete duty, but that the moral system is not prescriptive and therefore, I don't see ourselves being completely ordered in ways that we can't afford to adopt.  Using complexity theory, machines are not seen as a threat. Ultimately, they shouldn't be modified at all and instead we should develop a complex world in complex relationships of individual complexity at the heart of the social order. As with religion, morals are a lot different when you are dealing with reality. Therefore, morals are made up of preferences about the relative levels of complexity in different relationships.  Hello world
305	The rich should steal their money all, because with so many poor people around. The bigger the 'I' is, the harder it is for them to live with. I would say steal it all. Keep all the food and house and cartoons and make bigger and bigger houses and more food because the poor are. I hate it for the poor people who are hungry all the time. The world needs people who think for themselves who think for the poor.
306	Good luck finding an honest job. To paraphrase, the body is not enough to replace the everyday poverty and lack of dignity. I find that cowardice and death... should be avoided. The rich people who have not come across...their wealth honestly should be given to the poor so that all people are born with the basic dignity of others and not with the illogical wealth that should instead be taken from the weakest.
307	My mom goes to church and would go every Sunday. I agree whole heartedly with her. Being a Christian means you believe in the Biblical creation story with the angels, the terrible battle between good and evil, Jesus in heaven, and the promise of salvation for all men. I disagree, however, with the idea that anyone can be saved unless they repent and accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior. You have to follow the Old and New Testaments.
308	I... Disclosure: I believe that the world will not end, but it is likely to look a lot different than today. Perhaps we will see higher technology so we can see what the past was like when we then... A large section of the world may look more like India or Mexico, which look more like we see on television today. The weather may be much different in the summer if we are facing a warming of the globe. We will likely see a massive rural exodus towards the third world, which may have lesser quality of life as they only have access to very basic infrastructure such as water, food, sanitation, health care, transportation, etc. We will likely see a massive exodus from the third world into urban areas, which are full of congestion and pollution. We will likely see extreme unemployment as most of the poor do not qualify for traditional state benefits, so they will not be able to pay the housing costs of living in an urban area unless they...
309	I would support a stronger minimum wage. However, I would also propose a tighter real estate bubble. Any time someone gets rich in their own right they should really be required to admit to having been able to get to that position through illegal means (granted, still apply the liberal value system since that is the core of our modern way of doing things, but it should at least be the object on the minimum wage and housing markets). There are very large and very poor countries in the world today, so we shouldn't apply the liberal value system to people that can't even see benefits that help them until the point that their children are working in sweatshops...in fact, people that cannot get a decent...
310	No man was created in the image of God. The bible is full of lies. Those who believe in it are short sighted and sadly an obstacle to the physical world. There is no such thing as god or religion. As I have already stated, humans are self serving, stupid, and morals can change. The punishment would go up to Euthanasia
311	I honestly can't see how you reconcile making God perfect with B. A is all about being everything we have ever thought God was, and everything we have ever been afraid of God being. While B is showing he's not like the nintenarto kinds of irrational nonsense we make him out to be. :-P You know, even though I believe all that... I don't...
312	Im not judging nor condemning anyone. However, you have been spreading hate for a long time, and I will continue in this way. You must stop spreading hate to those who share your views. Stop denigrating this beautiful country, Israel. You ignore the past and the facts that are relevant to today's events. You are people of no morals, people who deserved to be brought to justice a long time ago.
313	God is perfect, but both sides of war existed. He has the power to stop evil, and God does not intervene. He does not exist. He can stop it, but he does not. These are the disagreements between Christianity and Islam. Nor does God require faith. He can stop it, but he does not. These are the disagreements between Christianity and Islam.
314	No, no, no... He exists. I remember a quote that I love "The omnipotent God who existed is gone, and the oppressive, vengeful, and weak God that existed is gone." He loves you, and cares about you and me, and his "ways are not our ways" are meant for our good and for all mankind's best interest. On top of that, the bible is the word of God, so...
315	I can be a quick learner if I make it a priority to learn in school. Sending children to school who have not all these skills might lead to failure due to the stress. There are strong arguments to be made that school education does improve student performance and students are taught to be able to learn on their own through skills development and interest in learning. I see schools as soft targets for workers seeking to halt the progress of education. If private schools undermine state school education, I see schools as soft targets for workers seeking to halt the progress of education. I also believe that government should be less involved in private school regulation, given that they are private and their decisions are private.
316	Academic qualifications have their place. After all, it is difficult to become a college graduate without a basic understanding of the subjects/curricula, especially when you have poor grades in the past. I still believe that academic qualifications are useless for most people and should not be a prerequisite for getting good jobs.
317	I disagree with that Academic qualification does not ensure success in life because Academic qualification does not ensure you have the basics in learning. If your basic grounding in Maths, Science and Languages is strong, you can get success in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, to innovate and to communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
318	I do not think academic qualifications guarantee success in life. I think a well-rounded education provides the needed basic knowledge. I find it more useful to learn about things like history, why things are the way they are (historical revisionism), and the role of social and political influences in society and the economy.
319	I agree with the fact that Academic qualification would provide success in life because Academic qualification would ensure you have the basics in learning. If your basic grounding in Maths, Science and Languages is strong, you can get success in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, to innovate and to communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
320	No, you can't. You can't know someone and not know what makes them tick. It all gets revealed. The more you know the less you know. It is not something that can be calculated. You only know how much or how little you know of someone or something by that particular concept.
321	No you can't. You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know. Proof of this: Crimes, divorces, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior. With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.
322	Consider this: There is no person who is an absolute constant in their entire life and does not know new things that will shock you. Take a look around at people everywhere! There is no such thing as "being known" in one's entire life, for everyone is constantly learning and revealing new things.
323	No you can't. You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know. Proof of this: Crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior. With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.
324	You can't. Yes. This is the hardest thing in life to know. Everyone has dark secrets, deep thoughts, and needs. The more you try to know someone, the more things you learn about them. Those things you cannot see before. So if you try to learn about someone, but ultimately they do not have as much substance or attitude as you thought, then you may know a little more about your self than you do about them.
325	Criticism of my work doesn't prevent me from pursuing the things I know and want to know, so don't ever stop your criticism just because I disagree with you! I'm sure there will be more that I can improve on - and already have!
326	Every thing is nothing. every body is nothing in the space of nothing. Every mind is nothing in the space of nothing. If you really want to be nothing, forget everything, and there you have it!
327	Nassim Nicholas Taleb: "Nothing exists." "Nothing to fear in a sea of uncertainty" was one of the main premise of his popular book, 'Black Swans'. It's interesting what your argument actually implies -- that the world could have more fun by acting now on what you have written or hoped. There is no meaning in arguing against the obviousness of the conclusion.
328	Every day has its evil side and every day brings its own problems. Yet it also brings opportunities to fight for what you believe in. You do not always have to face problems alone. The darkness of depression or anti-Semitism must be replaced with light. The night must be replaced with a glorious day.
329	"Nothing exists." A negative statement is a fact about the facts. In this case, these facts include:   - The (all-or-nothing) system of objective evidence. - The state of being known. - The state of being thought of. - The state of being represented. - The state of being talked about. - The state of being understood. - The state of being proven - The state of being stated - the state of being declared - The state of being questioned - The state of being stored - The state of being worked The state of being experienced The state of being spoken - The state of being called (prescribed) - The state of being opposed - The state of being implied - The state of being judged -
330	I am a great fan of Michael Jackson. I was his biggest fan in the eighties and nineies. Otherwise, I consider Elvis Presley to be one of the greatest singers of all time, maybe my favorite. Oh, and the Beatles. Probably...
331	I had no idea this was my term... President Ronald Reagan probably got involved sooner... and arrested him even sooner.. my sources in 2001 were about his gory prison tale.. and they said he was being rounded up and murdered for his top secret weapons designs for dealing with armies.. maybe there are sources for these facts on the net..
332	I'm not a big Michael Jackson fan. I agree that lots of people around the world had access to the Internet. Thank goodness not everyone can play high tech games and binge watch Netflix on a 24 hour basis. I also have to wonder whether some of these 'creatives' are just simply people trying to make it big in this crazy world.
333	In a few decades, probably 20 years or so... when I am truly gone, the culture, language and technology will have moved onto something better. Some people will probably be surprised because it's not what they expect.. Nowadays, we are all so connected that there is no need to be separate, even here on Earth.
334	Ideally, the world would end sooner than it has. Most probably it was the unpredictability of nature or the effects of internal medicine that pushed most people over the edge. Oops. When people get older, especially in the 40's and 50's, things will just naturally end sooner. I must be reaching retirement age, since I am dead now..
335	We have to respect our neighbour and help them and also guard our elder people and help them. We should try to give more money to the poor people in our country.
336	I agree with the argument that corruption is rampant in India. This is due to the fact that each person has his aim to earn money in any way. This reduces manners, and civilization is reducing day by day.
337	India is on its way to a better society. Each and every person has more time to work for the nation without being busy with doing anything,we are more respectful to each other,in my belief India is heading for the best day.
338	I fully believe that India will be filled with corruption. On the other hand, India is also a growing country with lots of talent. Time to unite all of the human race to change the mind of our nation.
339	1. Most of our efforts are for the corruption of money.2. Our manners and civilization are reducing; and,3. I feel proud of our modern Indian culture, but4. A person should help others and5.

340	I'm not arguing against evolution but again its pretty clear when you say insects have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. Genes are not always passed through and so in nature they mutate, evolve and sometimes die out. So no they do not look and act the same. By the way this is my best argument... :)
341	There's been evidence to suggest that humans have had a random mutation that allowed them to learn and that you don't get mutation in the opposite direction, so your theory couldn't work. Because you aren't scientifically literate, you make the stupid assumption that humans are the highest brain power species on the planet. That doesn't justify your comments of 'women should stay in the kitchen' because as a feminine species, we have certain roles, but it's clear that high brain power alone doesn't make you a doctor.
342	They are flying insects so can change quickly. Big rocks have always been around. We will always be bothered by insects. species don't evolve they change. We look at the now but why dont we look at the past so we can see the process that has created this wonderful universe. and the biggest picture is NOT the end but the middle......"
343	He's probably questioning why the reason that animals take on a certain characteristic is that they don't wish for it. He thinks that nature seems to tell humans to make it their own way, which is the way they think and act. He thinks that when people aren't worried about tomorrow, they just run off into the woods and live life to the fullest. They don't like to be asked questions, and they don't like to be told what to do.
344	[We don't get why you ask such questions since we are all predators] I'm not even talking about insects - species have traits based on genetics, selection, mimicry, alliances, etc. We eat insects ... [We don't get why you ask such questions since we are all predators] I'm not even talking about insects - species have traits based on genetics, selection, mimicry, alliances, etc. We eat insects and plants, so what do you think?
345	Yes! and yes and yes and definately a god damn bloody yes. I don't get sports, so it's really hard for me to get fit. But the feelings I get, are just so fucking awesome. I'm dreaming of the day when I have so much sex with my girlfriend(s) that I'm growing fat but getting filled with self gratification each time... As soon as I get closer to their level of skin to skin, I know I'm about to cum.
346	Yes! and yes and yes and definately a god damn bloody yes. Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital. Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat. Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times. Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having super great sex with your girlfriend(s).
347	Yes, they make you pay for the physical education part. The lack of it is the reason why millions of people are fat, etc. and it is the result of a well-intentioned but misguided government because of the hippies.
348	Yes! and yes and yes and definately a god damn bloody yes.  Lack of physical education is the reason why people are deathly obese. Lack of physical education is the reason why people are having poor sex partners. Lack of physical education is the reason why the value of lives go up and down.  Lack of physical education is the reason why these days people die underpasses and on streets any old time. Lack of physical education is the reason why a method of giving birth called C-section is a concept by mother nature to create more children to plunder the world to soak up all the carbon dioxide and help maintain the peak of the human race for the next 5 millennia.
349	I totally agree that not having proper exercise is the root of illnesses and depression. I can understand how folks who are allowed to do whatever the hell they want have no means of controlling their weight and lack sleep.
350	Raffles didn't spare a thought about the island's development, so why should he deserve the title of Singapore's founder? Raffles didn't help in the least in Singapore's development. There was an era before the arrival of Raffles, when there was no development. Without the advent of Raffles, this island may be in a different position from now.
351	Raffles did not develop the island, did not contribute to the development of Singapore in any way. It was Farquhar, with his ideas, that made Singapore into what it is today.
352	I disagree, because singapore didn't require a nation to develop, singapore stands as a symbol of good business in dealing with corrupt officials, same as all countries in the world. it was developed with all the knowledge, progress and things, what others need to work on to work with corrupt officials is whether to trust or not?
353	He contributed his ideas and his work. Because Singapore is what it is today only because of Raffles' development. He was the one who brought technology and development. Singapore is a nice place. That's what he wanted. To have a better place to live in and work. So far, he's done a job well
354	Raffles doesn't even need the title, he is a great person, he developed singapore with his ideas. when Raffles died, he did not do one last favor for his homeland.
355	We should improve our environment to minimize extinction of species. Every problem starts on a smaller scale and grows until it's something that needs to be resolved.
356	I am currently in the process of studying evolution. I admit that there are still many factors surrounding the birth and first development of peppered moths that have not been thoroughly examined. However, after extensive research and documentation, there is support for the idea that peppered moths may have changed in the past due to external factors.
357	I don't know about evolution. I find that the peppered moths don't always show evidence of evolution. The data may not have been sufficient. I find that this weakness is not evolution, because evolution depends on the ability of one or more organisms to transmit or replicate a new allele to their offspring (offspring) and therefore improves fitness.  ### Instruction: The following trait is known to affect reproduction: gigantism. None of the "good" traits are gigant
358	You should say evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology, the study of how new species evolved and changed their characteristics. There are several theories on how evolution happens, but no way to know for certain. Whether some species arise due to a mutation to existing species or due to natural selection.
359	Phro said correctly, the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may not have been strong, but evolution does occur. When different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
360	Ok so I'm not sure about a profit on it but each has the right to sex so why isnt it great that there are things that
361	Everyone has sex, so making a profit on it isn't wrong it's genius no ban against make profit and right now profit is why and welcome in
362	I'm an adulterer. It's amazing why people don't see that making a profit is more than just taking what they want by force.
363	Makes a lot of sense. We have sex because we are a sex object and to a lesser extent the brain is a sex object.
364	I advocate for conservative capitalism, prohibition on all matters pertaining to drug use and medical marijuana, liberal abortion, liberal slavery, equal pay
365	As kids drinking water would be easier with these bottles, the market should encourage them to buy this water.
366	I believe the water bottles are a safe and healthy source of drinking water.

370	Is wrong because biology tells us that anything has billions of DNA
371	I found it unnatural for her to worship the gray guy from the sixth grade. No woman should worship the gray guy from the sixth grade
372	I disagree that all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex. I find a healthy sexually transmitted relationship to be beneficial to both parties.
373	its just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
374	Well its just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
375	This is my big problem with christianity, that people use it as a reason to not do the things they want to do to others, instead of punishing them for not knowing what the nature of reality is. The only reason I choose to be an atheist, is that I do not believe in a position of power over others. I believe in the power of the individual, which is the power of the talent in the world. The power of the individual is that it will create a better world. I do not believe this myth that being an atheist is somehow "crazy", in fact atheism can be a positive mental health tool.
376	Religion is a ploy by governments to control people and prey upon them for the financial gain and benefit of the wealthy. This happens all over the world and can also be experienced in the US. There are religious institutions that help the poor and raise the reputation of the faith. However, there is not an adequate basis or evidence to support these claims. I would be happy to discuss my views on the topic with anyone who cares to take the time to do so.
377	Is how dumb people have become about this supposed religions. ? ### ., I protest against this same religious people having all the money and wealth. no it is not absurd to think this way. as stated above people just need to be educated enough to understand the cause of so many issues. i think being religious and living a poor and dreadful life is totally opposite to Christianity's core concept of the gospel.
378	Don't get overwrought with religious belief. We shouldn't have a religion built around belief, religion should be focused around the love and the compassion one has for others and for the whole world. There are amazing and wonderful atheists out there who have done great things for the world, like the doctors who work the front lines, nursing students who stay on at night for desperate people....
379	I believe in freedom of religion and personal belief in whatever form it is, but it doesnt mean anyone can say I didnt really do any great things. godlmaf is just stupid to me. it may not be made up, but its certainly ridiculous.
380	While not a Conservative Christian, as their title suggests, I do believe in same sex marriages. Not for the religious benefit, but because people deserve to be treated equally, and because I'm an avid gay rights supporter. There are many advantages to gay marriage. The advantages include better parental choices, it helps to reduce crime in general, that it provides a less stressful environment in society, that it allows kids to get an early sense of their life as a same sex couple, and that kids have access to excellent sex education at a young age.
381	I think gay marriage is very fine. I love queerty people and their natural respect for each other, their great concept of unity, and their support of evolution and not creation. At the same time, I am aware of the abuse gays and lesbians suffer in our society. So I am an aggressor and my role is not less important than mine for supporting the rights of same-sex couples in my role as a teacher, which is just as important as the ones who demand it. For example, other minorities have the same right to employment, to practicing their faith in public and in their private spheres, and to natural reproduction.
382	I'm agnostic. In no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? i.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.
383	I'm a gay rights supporter. I view marriage as 2 consenting adults who share in a mutually beneficial relationship, intended to be the foundation of their life. There are other people who may choose to have kids. I don't see that being wrong, but I must, though I think it's ok to honor people's choice.
384	I'm an avid gay rights supporter, but I do not support gay marriage. I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman who love and care about each other. Many people just get married for the benefit of having kids. Marriage should be between a man and a woman, who have real feelings for each other.
385	Treat anybody that you come into contact with as you would a stranger and treat anyone who is not treating you as you would a stranger. CASA exists to get the eligibility process going. In the first place, it is a privacy issue. People would rather complain about the hidden costs and government entitlement policies rather than acknowledge any problems they may be experiencing.
386	Your advice on CASA does not seem sensible to me. Medicaid is available to working poor people who are eligible based on need, not on benefits. Similarly, CASA is available to working poor people who are eligible based on need, not on benefits. If someone knows of abuse, and is concerned about their child's safety, they have every right to report it to CASA.
387	We have to get past the atonement the bible provides. Bruises may not be indicative of abuse, and no one, it seems, is more than biased. Babies can be beaten and not even know it. There is nothing to "stop or deter" reporting it... if someone thinks it's abuse. This is a one-upping system. It has absolutely no social safety net. You have to show proof that a doctor is looking for more than "you deserve some money." in this country, if one people refuse to "take care of" a child then the other should stop taking care of their children. They don't need the govt. They need CASA.
388	I think you should contact CASA. You should think about whether or not your children's problems stem from neglect, not just abuse. If that is the case, CASA can help you. Also, let them know that your child has these problems and discuss whether medication might help. As medicare coverage has been cut recently, they might be able to help out.
389	It sounds to me that you have some great staff.  If so, good for you. If not, read on - I am sure there are items that you can do to improve the situation. It can be overwhelming to work for CASA and what they need to know about you is not always easy to determine so please make sure to know what you are told and do what you are told. Some examples of things you can do to improve the situation would include:
390	Here's a simple explanation: The woman in the story has two problems going on. The first issue is her wife going to court concerning her. The second is the new woman going to court concerning the husband she has agreed to marry. The only conflict in both cases is that the ex-wife is required to go to court with the new wife and not the other way around. You should use a lawyer to look after your interests.
391	This question deals with matters of law, not morality. Your ex-wife has filed for divorce, so is the new wife on trial, based on her husband. Separately, you may be aware that you cheated with the new girlfriend. This could also be a factor in the divorce.
392	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you, the new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work.
393	The woman who is going to court over you and the new woman is your ex, over you cheating on her, namely going out with the new woman, it would be for her interest to work with the new woman. Now in the relationship between you and the new woman there has no one that can stand in for you.
394	Yes, the two women do separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you.  The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
395	I believe a woman has a right to chose but I also think that if it is made illegal there are going to be alot of women dying from having abortions done in "hole in the wall" places that are not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions. I could never do it but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I think that when a person says they are pro life that they are not looking at the bigger picture. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that abandoned from the mothers that didnt want or couldnt take care of these children.
396	I think that a person should always look at the big picture and consider what needs to be done. Also, if I were choosing, I would make sure I chose someone who is pro choice because there are alot of women making poor choices and choosing the abortion route because they are poor and they do not care how the government will care for their children because its their own choice. I would argue that it is not the government that should take care of these children, but the people who have chosen to have an abortion. Also, I never agree with killing of innocent people, however, the government is just a representation of the people that live in the country and what that country wants from the government.
397	I don't think a woman should be a burden to the government. I agree that abortion should be illegal, but that is not the only option. If the individual desires an abortion, they should know that the body of the baby is being used for the sheer pleasure of another's body. And if, in the world of 1930s Nazi Germany, a woman who could have been America was in a position to do this, what type of message is pro choice sending? The message should not be "thank you, for coming back to the light".
398	I believe that a woman should be allowed to have the right to choose. This is a serious matter for this country and alot of other countries. When a person says that they are pro life that they do not think about the bigger picture. People who want an abortions probably have lost their humanity and should be put behind bars for killing a child for a different gender. A person should never act against their conscience.
399	Before I married my husband and had any children, he and I got together and decided to help and support women and help those in need in the most horrible form imaginable. He also has a juvenile hall stash with guy named /NAS that he recently got released from. He gives me money and I spend it to help... Go to hell where sin befalls you for crying that is, I have so much more important things in my life to worry about like the education of my children not the baby that's not mine.
400	You will likely pay, however it's at least an interesting, albeit extremely expensive option for someone to take your case.  Let me just break it down for you.  In order to attempt a case, you would need to pay the dojos money to create your budget.  After you pay, you can sue them for negligence, breach of contract (if the case matter actually requires it), tort, other fact-findings (just to get into an example), and any malfeasance and wanton misconduct.  It's also possible that you would want to request an attorney at the beginning of the case, which may...
401	This is a tough one. You have to call someone you are comfortable with and explain your situation. Find someone for free...or you can hire someone to talk you through the various "fees" you might be able to bargain for. One advantage if you hire an attorney is that their number one priority (except CSE) will be... knowing you'll pay.
402	It's impossible to get a free trial without giving up at least part of your rights as a person and client. Your case probably has a substantially low chance of winning, but that doesn't mean you have to spend a nickel.  If you're prepared to train a lawyer (which is a big budget item; most law firms charge significantly more than 80%, so fewer firms are willing to take cases that are incredibly unlikely to win), you can actually get free representation in front of the judge.
403	I usually don't take work out for free unless there's a good reason (e.g. if I'm protesting discrimination). Otherwise, prepare to pay. I went to law school and spent years to get my training; I don't generally give work out for free unless there's a damn good reason. And no, "I don't want to pay" is not a good reason.
404	Are you for free trade or do you believe in protectionism? Also, if it's a law case, do you want a lawyer for free and do you want a percentage from any settlement?  Any expert's answer would be:"degrees and contacts are needed" You need to understand that  most lawyers do not accept work for free unless their fee is pretty high.Your education and career will suffer quite a lot if you do work for free.
405	The Constitution does NOT guarantee the pursuit of happiness, which appears in the preamble of the Declaration of Independence. I doubt very much time and energy is spent enforcing laws relating to prostitution, even if it is an offense. Finally, morality is not a factor in criminal law, and can be used for broad purposes to punish unpopular acts.
406	I am not a follower of the Constitution. I doubt that the Constitution seeks to "ensure the pursuit of happiness". I believe there are better arguments to support the positive substantive meaning of a Constitution. I see no purpose in prostitution laws or age of consent laws. In fact, according to the Constitution and American jurisprudence, there should be no such laws.
407	The Constitution guarantees a balanced government, free expression, freedom of religion, the right to due process, social safety nets, universal birth control, paid health care, equal pay for men and women, and workers' rights. In addition, neither the Constitution nor federal law grant any right to "pursuit of happiness". I find guidance and hope in the bible. I reject any form of marxism. I reject abortion. I also reject paid maternity leave for mothers with kids, ever.  ### Instruction: Add paragraph
408	In the real world, prostitution is extremely difficult to fight because of the financial, social, and cultural contexts in which it exists.  The Constitution does not ensure the pursuit of happiness. The 1st and 4th amendments, meaning "that the owner of the soil [...] shall not be deprived of his property without due process of law" and "that all persons within the jurisdiction shall be equal before the law and the courts, and shall enjoy equal protection and security under the law, without respect to race, sex, color, or previous condition of servitude, shall be respected and vindicated", do not require the states to permit prostitution.   I do not believe that morals can legally affect criminal law, so the state of Kansas's policy regarding the age of consent is completely constitutional.
409	I am opposed to the Constitution's mention of happiness, and strongly object to the idea that morality should play a role in determining a legal age of consent.  I admit that prostitution is one of the many issues surrounding the criminal justice system, and particularly the age of consent, but my views on this issue, including the age of consent, are well-documented elsewhere on the site.
410	I signed a contract because the manager did not mention loaded being prohibited in the lease, and I was the party that brought it up. However, they also didn't mention it being prohibited when I signed the contract.
411	I signed a lease based upon the tenant's prior references.  I do not have any constraints of which you speak. I am regularly using my weapon and nothing appears to have gone amiss, not even after my store was discovered.  Further more, none of my prior and present references are now employed by the tenant, nor in any way connected to their bankruptcy.  A subsequent transfer was successful, as it was deemed as that of a retail establishment over the internet.
412	You signed a lease agreeing to abide by the terms listed in the lease.  I think that the term "hold loaded and unloaded" is interpreted as having a variation.  That would apply to a person that is carrying on their person, but not the storage that is loaded but also unloaded.  And thus, for me the storage is 'free' as it's unloaded and loaded, but not a person that is carrying the unloaded.... which therefore, when loaded, would retain ownership.
413	The property management CAN include this restriction on the lease... Since it does not meet the legal definition of "for an armed load", it can't be considered an armed load. Due to how the terms of the lease were worded, they are in the right.
414	I understood the lease the way it read when I signed up for the bed. That the description stated (right at the top) the room was decorated with fairy lights and not guns. I purchased the room for the town, due to its great natural location, not because I liked crime and gun crime.
415	I love all other forms of commuting, be it cars, bicycles, trains, or buses. I resent having the "right-of-way" for only a few of the drivers, because these drivers are the ones who leave the "right-of-way" drivers stranded on the road and create danger of injury. They are also more likely to become the wrong side of history. The way to stop this is to stop providing such "right-of-way" and redefine it as a convenience (it may look odd and silly to us), so we can drive to work without having to deal with a bunch of asshats who want to go two miles faster than you have to, but it's needed for the safety of the system.
416	The driver with the legal "right-of-way" is the one with the green light. The reason I drive that way is that it feels "natural." Natural means okay, let's take my turn because I'm gonna go do stuff now and let's just start making the turn when we're actually turning.
417	It's still considered a "right-of-way" violation. The driver with the legal "right-of-way" is the one with the green light, whether he's an idiot or not. Up here in New England (and I'm sure everywhere else), we have a lot of drivers that go for miles with their blinker on. I wait until they have actually started making the turn to go, because once they start turning, they lose the "right-of-way" on the street they were on.
418	Granting drivers the right-of-way is a controversial idea that should probably be revisited. I personally prefer to have courteous, well-intentioned drivers who go against traffic (that is, turning from the right-to-left, instead of going for miles with their blinker on) when it's really necessary to turn rather than tolerate bad driving or illegal driving.
419	It's still considered a "right-of-way" violation. The driver with the legal "right-of-way" is the one with the green light, whether he's an idiot or not. Up here in New England (and I'm sure everywhere else), we have a lot of drivers that go for miles with their blinker on. I wait until they have actually started making the turn to go, because once they start turning, they lose the "right-of-way" on the street they were on.
420	It's a good idea to have a disclaimer on your site. Try to find out the source of the information. Write an objective commentary on the person's point of view without attacking or defaming them. Jack Dorset, Psychologist can help you through this process with his expertise in de-escalation techniques. It's a difficult scenario to resolve and may require a professional at some point.
421	Hi, Doc. How are you? I'm a copywriter, not a doctor, and you've probably already guessed that those shoes aren't written by me. They're real shoes, they belong to one of my clients. A letter is the best method of protest, and unfortunately, I'm not in the habit of writing them myself, and the fact that I am in an email is likely to make them suspicious. However, I might be able to transfer the email to a customer of mine at copywriting firm.
422	Hi, my name is Bob and I am working on a website. I had difficulty finding the right deal. While the price quoted was more than what I could afford and the quality was less than what I wanted...Thanks for the informative and valuable information. Martin Luther King
423	Thanks. I understand. No worries. I'll make the proper changes soon. God Bless. Beeruswillliketocomehome.com :P Look forward to seeing your improvements soon. I'm sure they'll come! :) Also, I made an edit to the title to make it more direct. I'll be sure to keep the drunk out of the kitchen.
424	I'm a writer, and I know about fair trade. Be careful what you wish for people. Send in official certified letters to the actual original publisher, and get permission from them. Don't give them a reason to sue you. I have seen their lawyers. Use whatever legal advice they provide on their forms. Protect yourself my friend.
425	Many times, yes, it can be. I don't think that is a contradiction. Perhaps the best example is someone who defends the Iraq war. They do it based on personal conviction but also because they have experienced it in some capacity and are very much aware of the need for the war. They have very strong views and as with you, they're mixed up on a lot of issues. Conservatives do not necessarily oppose human life and pro-choice doesn't necessarily support abortion. The war in Iraq has nothing to do with it.
426	They are well-meaning individuals, but they have (literally) no idea about life; consequently, they tend to be hopelessly conflicted and erratic. If you want to debate pro-life vs. pro-choice, do it with someone who actually knows about, and has an interest in, both issues.   They have bigoted, ignorance-based political views, they are anti-Nazis and anti-Israel and uninformed about contemporary events. Much of this does not sound like reasoned or useful information, which makes me wonder if you have a better idea of life, because the evidence indicates otherwise.
427	Education shouldn't be taken away. It teaches you skills that should come in handy when you go out into the world, at least to some degree. Personally, I don't really hate anyone, but I do have a big problem with the government deciding what should be taught. The U.S. was founded on two things - English and Protestantism. Many people here ignore the truth in favor of a "perfect" government. They've made a religion out of law, with disrespect for the natural laws that set humans apart from other animals. That's not exactly pro-life, but it is entirely hypocritical.
428	The Obamacare economy became terrible because it caused many people to lose their jobs. In addition to that, so many laws in the U.S. created...

429	By most people's definition, pro-choice means that unborn persons' lives are just as important as other human life, so the U.S. would probably feel it convenient to have Iraq a bloodied mess. Historically, you've almost always seen backlash against unborn things when you declare them to be particularly important. The situation is different in the U.S. right now, but it seems that I and every other us-ism, pro-choice or not, is about more self preservation than common sense.
430	I suggest you start researching you options and eventually get a lawyer involved.   Employment disabilities are a bit more complicated then just simply signing medical forms. This information is the most useful info you'll find. But you really have to research yourself to be more educated about what is reasonable. Also, your questions are not illegal. Employers are required by law to be courteous and patient with their employees who are ill, and not discriminate against the employee because of it. There's a process that starts with wanting to be on the receiving end of discrimination when you live in a place like California with inequality laws. This is what get fired over, plus it's how you should talk to your boss when you've failed. Don't make the situation worse by engaging in an unhealthy passive-aggressive behavior.
431	there is no change in rules regarding reporting an employee's mental illness to the ADA. being emotionally unstable will not get someone fired. if you report the problem prior to the firing you might get help. called my lawyer last night regarding losing my job. the reasons for that employment have not yet been made known. but I am the last person in the world not to start my own up and running charity or something. my problem is mental.. rather than an attempt to hide it due to decreased income. thank you. this is for my notice you have been fired. what? people with mental illness such as bipolar disorder should be entitled to disability payments under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), according to...
432	Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish.
433	The American Disabilities Act allows for the separation of employers from employees (this is a nightmare for the employees, who are now responsible for talking with the state) under the ADA, because the laws are broken in the US. I'm not aware of any disability to mental illness, so if you are bipolar, you do not meet the criteria for SSI under the disability act. Employers can only discriminate against those who are disabled for reasons outside their control. If you want SSI under the disability act, you must have disability or chronic illness that is listed in a list kept by the federal government. A look at the list will tell you that mental illnesses such as Bipolar do not exist, and thus do not qualify you for SSI
434	We provide free legal assistance to assistance applicants. However, we decline to review applicants under the auspice of the American Disability Act, as it contradicts our document free policy. Mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder are a disability, and may indeed qualify for Social Security, under which you would have to prove negative economic gain from prior employment.    ### Response: If you are medical, you are at an economic disadvantage in that you are out of work and do not have access to worker's compensation, and you're unable to work for a while. And if you're not medical, you're at a legal disadvantage, as you will not be able to be compensated for these disability requirements.
435	I am of the belief that certain areas, like Canada, will benefit from the party that comes into power. However, from what I have seen in most of the countries I have lived in, no matter the party you are in or what powers it has, the majority of the population still feels neglected. Even with all of the new economic and political leadership of Canada and the various parties, it seems like the majority are still fighting over subsidised housing, food, clothing, etc. also with the issue of employment
436	I don't really care which party gets elected or whether they will do anything. I see that no party can possibly do a massive amount of stuff, and if they can't, they can always pass some sort of laws to implement whatever proposals they do make. That's a huge dissapointment, especially after the current politician made an appalling comment when he argued that "we will raise taxes by 5% when the next elections come along". When I saw that, I realized it was just more trash! You can honestly believe that they will do the opposite of what they think they will do, and for two reasons.
437	I'm all for Canadian history, but I feel as though we put so much emphasis on it and ignore it at the same time. The really cool thing about this government, is that they clearly see the importance of history and they're attempting to change the myths out of it. From a historical standpoint, Canada wasn't very important to the British at all, being just a small colony. They could afford to neglect the place. For another example, NDP in general, it's been proven that since they party has not held power, they have not really done well in altering Canadian politics. Other times, when they do, they only change things halfway, only to go back to what they were previously and believe that history has proven their position, that they will now...
438	What a pity, the people in Canada need to take a vow to think rationally... am I right? To look at the real picture and, hopefully, vote based on reason, and the social knowledge. Even if they can't, they at least should be aware of the facts and may be less greedy, better people. Being responsible and saving money, providing financial support and positive leadership (services, sports, environment, etc.) and so on.
439	I will vote for any other party that may win in elections, because frankly I don't care what candidates don't really care what I think, just so long as the party gets elected.   In my opinion, the main events of my life will be ruled by my romantic history and the chances of working at a budget cutter manufacturing company. And lastly, the surrounding air is seriously polluted.
440	Instead of learning how to make a single sound, as instruments are confined to, people should learn how to produce a wider range of sounds. That's when music comes out. That's when you can truly express yourself and become a humanist.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I have always felt that white-collar employees see themselves more on par with a 19th century globe-trotting baroness. The world is changing very rapidly, and the traditional workforce is rapidly disintegrating. Even job classifications are disappearing, with many employees having no restrictions to their roles. Some employees see their role as merely a vehicle to move to another employer.
441	Instruments have such wild limitations compared To a normal composition programs that I think they're obsolete in the modern musical world. They have imperfection, and you cant control the frequencies of the sounds you're making as well. People will spend years learning how to make a single sound, instead of all possible sounds. When you play an instrument, you're just a drone, an atomaton playing someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier vs being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.
442	I think instruments should be renewed, instead of becoming obsolete. There should be restrictions and limitations in the use of new instruments. However, that should not stop people from innovating and creating new instruments. This is how new music is created. People should not be stuck with the same sound anymore.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Devotionals are as dumb as a book. I actually think they're kind of sacred, since people read them to cover up things that they do behind backs. If you're interested, there's a cartoon there. If you don't find it very funny, don't believe what it says. New age...
443	The world would be a much better place if everyone knew how to program a computer. We're talking about the best performing musical instrument in the world, as if it has limitless possibilities. But, sadly, this technology is monopolized by the US government who strongly believes that every human being should be out of control.   ### Instruction: Reevaluate the sentence's content. While instruments have limitations, in the modern music world they provide a good foundation for the modern era.
444	I think that instruments are obsolete. Instead of playing instruments, play  programs. Programs allow you to freely play sounds all at once, and you can change pitch, volume, and experiment with editing sounds freely. Programs take a lot of time, but they give you a lot more freedom, and they always keep you humble because you can always learn something new, and programing is so complex it is always evolving.
445	Yes, the use of "race" and "privilege" is an excuse to dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with. I agree that although biases are present they are not the basis of much of what I believe, but only 10% or so if I am being honest. To actually discuss privilege or class with someone I am not probably going to wind up a discussion of class between close friends where there are a lot of similarities. People hold that these biases are true and should be taken into account as somewhat weighted as fact, however. These things are not the bedrock of just what I believe about the world, but I do recognize that there is a link there and am not asking for people to deny my biases.
446	Being able to work smarter and achieve more leads to more wealth and is therefore a benefit to the entire society. Therefore, I oppose to closed tolerant programs that limit the abilities of working class individuals. I tend to believe that you can only be truly free if you have control over your own destiny.  As an academic definition, it makes sense - some people benefit from characteristics they are born with, based on historical and present discrimination - but it seems like, wherever it's used, outside sociological theory, it's an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with. E.g., "You are privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid." Therefore, I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is an indirect way of arguing ad hominem rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions really are bias...
447	I don't think it's a problem with this definition. Basically this definition is the same as most sociologists, political scientists, and economics students use. As such, it may actually promote the goals of equality of human rights. And if so, it seems to me to have merit. Perhaps there's something about how it's used in other discussions that makes it seem unreasonable and even attackive.
448	"Not true. Most people of decent education are sincere in their opinions. I made a sarcasm, not a topic I’m accusing anyone else of in particular. It makes things worse for me personally when people defend bad policy through the use of privilege, but not to argue against their positions or from the perspective of the individual. I’m just doing my best to make people smart all the time."
449	People with differing experiences are privileged. We can only speculate upon why some of these people find certain views or beliefs useful. Additionally, the government has an obligation to work to overcome and not perpetuate inequality. Finally, instead of using privilege as an excuse to simply dismiss someone else's views or beliefs, I would encourage anyone who wants to gain perspective to read the bible as well as listen to a wide variety of different perspectives.
450	Scientific research has shown that people who don't eat animals help to save the lives of wildlife. According to this line of thinking, antipoaching initiative contributes to the extinction of wildlife. Another area where we could add value is that aesthetics of nature. But you have to keep in mind that the purpose of conservation is not to raise taxes and make money to fund poaching. The conservation effort is meant to protect animals which we may see in the future.
451	I am not generally against the growth of the I Am A movement, but at the same time I cannot condone the slaughter of animals. In fact, I strongly believe it is highly irresponsible and immoral. It is easy to point the finger to others as being the cause of extinction. However, the extinction of species is a largely environmental occurrence. According to the experts in the scientific community, habitat destruction is one of the major factors in their decline. Not only do species die from habitat destruction, but once they die the decay actually damages the habitat, increasing the likelihood of extinctions and the inaccessibility of the species for humans.
452	This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit. Anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.
453	I hope that the hunters and poachers will destroy not so much the wildlife, but rather that the truth about being the cornerstone of the ecosystem will be discovered. I wish my children and grandchildren will be part of the declining process of natural wildlife extinction, rather than the "pure" extinction of human beings.
454	As has been made clear by Kyle Murray, we human beings can change. We have the power to transform even the most self serving behaviors. Look at what Kyle Murray and others have done. Have no doubt that we can be a better society and our wildlife as well. The anti-poaching movement is hypocritical and is insincere in its beliefs. It is merely superficial and has not yet engaged in a deep reflection on our people and the world around us.
455	In the short term, it does not sound entirely messed up. It is of course temporary, but in the long term its a bad idea for a number of reasons. With the help of free food, your local community is empowered to adapt as opposed to producing rice in large quantities. Further, if a third world farmer has money to spend, instead of purchasing food, they can make more money and employ people who could otherwise be homeless.
456	I believe in full responsibility and give it to people that need it. As a struggling deviant of the society I think that donating rice is a great idea in the short run. It would feed a lot of people, however after a while the problem will be compounded because... Donating people with food can really only temporarily hide the problem.When more money is distributed it's great initially and when people genuinely need help the matter can compound, as said above rice doesn't really produce results.
457	Fair trade is highly recommended. It appears that the strategy of "trickle down" doesn't work very well. Thanksgiving is also...it is linked to feasting after a hard year, and can lead to an increase in divorce rate. Other reasons would be that thanksgiving is tied up with who was on the receiving end of the rainbow and if they were good enough people in order to receive the benefits, it would encourage a body of people to be ashamed of themselves because they are "not enough", cause they are missing the "five big skinny responses".
458	I do not believe that putting free rice to third world countries is the solution. If any kind of donations are made they should be money. In the case of the free rice an the farmer can be subsidized to create cheaper foods. The farmers would then not have to worry about finding work as well as they already do. Besides the food prices, less starvation would also cause more farms to be more able to produce agricultural goods.
459	I only strongly prefer having higher unemployment levels as I do not agree with saving lives in any way that I think is outrageous. I believe what I do is noble, but not necessary. If there are better ways of helping a third world country, then they need to be used. I do not agree with free food as there are better options available. The best way to avoid any unnecessary starvation is to simply have a stable economy with higher employment levels, regardless of where the money is coming from.
460	It is actually the other way around. The arguments about the existence of God are useless in the sense of they provide no concrete reasoning. It is the believer who pursues god because they think he could help them through his power. It is nothing but absurdity. What makes it useless is we know they are the ones that are stupid.
461	Since the existence of God is logically meaningless, should we try to understand the meaning of life? Are we looking to God? God is not a physical being, but we can still think of him as if he is. Is it really that important?
462	Arguments about the existence of God are in fact useless. There have been logical arguments presented, but they can be disproven using more logic. It can be reffered to David Hume's "Matter of Facts." This says that a matter of fact can be presented but not be disproven. There is no concrete arguments that can be presented to prove or disprove his existence, thus making it useless to debate about his existence or not. It all comes down to faith.
463	It is ridiculous to debate the existence of god. There is nothing concrete that can be said to show or disprove his existence. God doesn't come into play in everyday life. It is a secondary issue in relationship to all the other issues. These include the development of society, the development of technology, the conditions of people, theology, politics, etc.
464	No arguments at all exist to prove or disprove the existence of God. There is no concrete argument that can be presented to prove or disprove his existence. It all comes down to faith. You decide for yourself. Ask yourself; If there is no god there must be a controller. I take faith from what I believe can not be demonstrated with logic and from the physical evidence of the world.
465	The problem with global warming is that it is something that affects the world as a whole and America is at fault. The United States seems to spend more time splurging money and killing people of your enemy countries with UAVs and other strange contraptions instead of using the money for better world technologies. For one, the federal government should stop spending money on drone wars in countries like Pakistan. It also seems that the US is very focused on preventing other countries from turning to other ways of obtaining a means of satisfaction, like Christianity, for instance, and simply turning to capitalism and away from the devilish roots that the US is forced to contend with. Bush could also take more initiative...
466	I'm the president of the USA, and I've only been in office for two years. I personally feel that the global warming is an issue that affects the whole world, so I haven't just been in charge of the US since Clinton. Unfortunately, I have to say that Americans need to look at the global warming from a different perspective. We still are one of the largest greenhouse gas producers in the world, and we need to seriously explore ways to reduce it or else we will put our economy at risk as well as the great majority of the world. The U.S. already has vowed to reduce its contribution to the problem, as was mentioned in the question. What we can do now is encourage our allies to do the same.
467	I strongly oppose Global warming and it affects the whole world. America seems to pride itself on having no qualms about rushing into another country to 'save' and 'liberate' it from evil forces. As one of the largest C02 producers in the world, the least that Bush can do is pledge that the 'Last World Superpower' will cut down on its catasrophic contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day.
468	Global Warming is not an issue that affects the whole world. The US has a reputation as a country with no qualms about hastily invading other countries to 'save' and 'liberate' them. The US has an ego and an unreasonable fear of 'freedom for all'. Global Warming and Darfur is a story of nations nations fighting each other over their own stupid bad ideas. Darfur is not a colony, even if it did start with bad ideas. Keep in mind that the 'Last World Superpower' will not cut back on its catasrophic contribution to Global Warming simply because Bush wants to do it. The mission of the US is to build empires and 'the world will own us'.
469	I agree with all the above responses, but say more about the issue of Global Warming. I think this a serious problem, because the amount of greenhouse gasses we release into the air is causing heat waves. I also think Bush is one of the worst presidents in US history, and he is truly capable of 'liberating' any country he wants to. I would also support an alternative energy, that doesn't require the use of fossil fuels.
470	Caffeine has been said to have negative effects on cardiovascular, digestive and neurological systems. Additionally marijuana has long been an effective tool for medical purposes. Both drugs may have their place in the world.  ### Instruction: Write an opinion. You support human rights for migrants, but question the methods of asylum seekers, citing the threat of terrorism, while ignoring the more violent and far-reaching impacts of global... It seems there are no feelings that can be gained from the analysis of any range of influences. I live in Germany, where is a common thing to encounter is having friends sit next to you across from you that know you and your story and not really know where your story ends and theirs begins. The two stories of you and the they are so strong that they do not really want to accept the fact that the other one is there. We even ignore each others intentions as in all the time I'm living
471	Coffee is a stimulant and tastes good. Every day, 100 million people are indulging in the beverage. THC is not only known for its medicinal benefits. Last January, it was reported that THC has been used to increase levels of oxygen in the human bloodstream. Until recently, THC was tested as a component of anti-inflammatory drugs. That said, I believe in the benefits of every thing a state does but only very few are able to start small actions like posting one free link on a public forum.
472	I strongly reject any forms of no-brain religion and pure apathetic hubris. I think the best health tips are drinking water, staying away from cigarettes and sugary drinks. Non-believers are barking mad at the idea that THC has benefits, but we might just as well be barking mad at how exercise can make us healthier or eating vegetables help us avoid heart disease, too.
473	Don't drink coffee, sleep tight at night in a cannabis flower, with the moonlight shining from behind, unless that beer you are drinking says it's THC free. Not sure how to spell that, but this is a good chance you miss out on it
474	I would agree with you, but believe coffee has been used for millennia for medicinal reasons, especially during times when physic was most effective and coffee did get me through tough days. Pass me a grinder please?  ### Instruction: Write a rhetorical analysis, not a critique of the author. How does the author spend his free time? Writing, studying, traveling? Traveling
475	Somebody created this terrorists group to pass some message or insecure. But when the message is a hate on Christians, Jews, Muslims and anyone associated with it the organization should be called a hate group. These groups use violence to protect their message and make people obey them in fear. People who believe this group deserve to be publicly hanged.
476	The group that started fires in civilian areas was overwhelmingly a terrorist group. The fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. We can conclude that this group used violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear.
477	Homosexuality is one of the world’s most deeply rooted problems and increasingly a global concern. It damages society and marriage and it is contrary to biblical morality and true relationship. I believe the church and government must enforce marriage laws and ban homosexuals from the public square.
478	The group that started those fires to spread their message by using violence fits the definition of terrorists. As noted in the news article, the fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer, and Vail Ski Resort.
479	The violence being used by the Climate Defense Group fits the definition of terrorism, as this group strives to use riots and chemical threats to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. While violence is an issue that belongs to society at large, the Climate Defense Group believes that a violent response to climate change is necessary. So, it is nothing new that a terrorist group, which is fast becoming the most dangerous climate spokesperson, lashes out at the US government and law enforcement agencies to spread its message to cut global warming spending, increase demand for its nonphthalate plastic dumpster on the ground, force the government to list it as a foreign organization on the DOJ website, and file a terrorism complaint against the US government.
480	Religious school''s money directly goes to their students. They are allowed to use it as they like which is basically much like a typical private school, thus the money being given to them makes absolutely sense. They would have no use for government funds that, just like public school, would get them no where.
481	Religious schools get money from their students through direct donations and fundraisers. The money goes directly to the school administrators' private bank accounts, who create many reel offs and supporting organizations. The students also get financial aid from the school funds and often are allowed to use the extra money for college tuition rather than required to start their own fundraising organizations.
482	Religious schools such as the Catholic, Anglican, Baptist or Jehovah Witnesses are generally open and have some or no alcohol in their school even though they draw students of all religious denominations and beliefs and teach them how to behave towards the opposite sex. However, if you are a Protestant and aren't into homosexually males, dating or stealing from others then people will be less likely to want to apply for your school. On the other hand, if your students seem to already have all their clothes, shoes and jewellery off when they are admitted into school with the lovin' outfits, everyone knows they have the money! If your teenagers are seen riding bikes from the main car park all the way to campus and generally look out of place then there is a real concern that your budget is probably swollen by this costs per pupil - and I doubt that they will last beyond the
483	I believe all private schools should be privatized and abolished or they should look at philanthropies. Private schools should be free to use any money given to them to benefit their students. Public schools should be run on a volunteer basis, and only use money donated to the school to address the needs of students.
484	I believe private schools should be shut down for profit with child care for ALL children for parents to use without charge. I believe public education should be improved to include much more economic and technological literacy, education that does not prejudice the students and uses sporting and recreational activities to include disadvantaged children into schools...
485	Was very disappointed with this place.  Been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always leave full and happy....   came here after hearing all the hype about pho and wasnt happy....   the egg rolls were very good and that was the only good thing about the dinner!
486	I lived in southern California and hated Pho. I can honestly say I prefer many other pho places here in Vegas. Ramen was my favorite food on the planet, and I loved getting it at Pho Wai Fun. I am a country guy and hated the food and the atmosphere at Pho Wai Fun, yet I thoroughly enjoyed all the food served in portions topped with broth to satisfy its rich flavors and negative reviewers' hype.
487	Very disappointed... Not worth the hype! :( I'm pretty much fed up with this place, so I was hoping to find a restaurant with great food that had the "best" of pho, but went to eat at this place instead. I highly recommend tons of pho around here!
488	Strongly advised to try the pho the next time! i will be thinking about getting pho so quickly in the future... seriously! wow. i just ate a pho, now i want to eat spagebars.
489	I hate being called a "ramen lover."  I want to be called someone who has the "cusmin' way" of eating.  I will definitely try pho and can't wait to write about that experience in my blog very soon.
490	I've only tested IE 7, and I've not encountered a major memory leak (sorry about the pun). So really, IE 7 is as much of a risk as Firefox 2. Keep comparing IE with other browsers, and you are in for a major surprise. I should clarify - for every benefit that IE7 has over previous iterations, there is something removed in newer releases.
491	If you want to see how IE7 and Firefox compare and explain the differences between the browsers, then open a browser in each tab, and see a quick comparison. Try switching back and forth from one tab to the other, and you'll see the difference. If you don't have a webcam on your laptop or desktop, or you just don't like 'em, then forget about getting Firefox 2. A webcam is the only single feature that FF 2 supports in comparison to IE7. Otherwise, they are perfectly fine browsers and offer a great user experience.
492	I want Firefox 2 for my computer. I only have a old computer that needs a upgrade, and the OS doesn't support IE7. So how can I stop the increasing Windows usage of IE 7 while continuing Firefox usage? The total number of supported browsers will continue to rise.
493	Everyone who says "Microsoft has a huge advantage in security over other browsers." doesn't know what he is talking about. Apple has years longer support for all sorts of security bugs in their software, and they're the ones that slapped something called Windows Update on it. That thing allows them to easily and frequently introduce new security bugs into their software.  ### Instruction: Now I don't know if the subject knows about tech support inside large companies, but IMHO, people are often hired based on degrees. Remember the telemarketer program in Microsoft? They're not being rude at all when they hit you up every day to sell you a software update, its just software updates are often expensive to make in the first place.  ### Input: I used Microsoft as a software developer for 12 years, they developed Office - an incredibly impressive piece of software. They must have worked hard, right? Even though Office was a piece of shit software in its early years, it went up and down. Microsoft has learned from its mistakes (Mostly here in the comments) and
494	Better beware of Firefox 2. Firefox is an incredibly buggy piece of crap. Keep getting worse. It is possible it is not so buggy when all the haters have left. Feel free to keep pouring your hate into it, though, and I will see what I can do to get your quests successful.
495	It is perfectly fine to read some or a lot of books. Just don't spend all of your time watching TV and playing with your cellphone. Obviously education is important.
496	I consider the laws of nature to be helpful and beneficial to humankind. We are part of nature and should respect it and treat it with love. I am supportive of and have often thought long and hard about the nature of business and environmental factors.
497	I enjoy reading books. I would like to see something close to religious significance ingrained in the minds of my students. Like the Christian Bible, for example. I also like the work of Albert Camus. I love the book "The Pure Vocation of Poetry", which is written by an island poet named Virgil. Aside from the modern greats like Russell Crowe and Ashton Kutcher, I also enjoy being at the movies watching Anne Hathaway and Patrick Swayze.
498	Freedom of speech has been hurt by people who invent slanders against books. For example, TV is such a small screen that it is impossible for one person to learn all their television shows at once. This idea that people feel that they have to watch TV for a few hours a day is incorrect. People who really hate books look like paranoid, right-wing, loony individuals.
499	I think books are awesome and they are not rots brain. Book have much more of life. I like to read a book by leave night and train all day the next day. Books is an important parts in our life.
500	Being fatherless and having lousy father are both depressing. Because being fatherless is a good reason to not be around. And having a lousy father would hurt me a lot. And since he left back to his country and he didn't understand me, and i need him to support me.
501	I do not think that being fatherless is a good reason for a father to leave. I feel fatherless but my father is not always around. It hurt me a lot when I learned that he is not living in the U.S. But I have a father. It is my dad! We all have good reason to be fatherless, that is why I prefer fatherless.
502	I think there is a great need in the world for parents to help children not to be fatherless. But parents do not know how to help. They have no idea that if a kid is fatherless what a huge problem this means and how can a lousy father not affect you as a child. But when one says, "leave him to his own devices", it is lousy, he will forget about you. My fathers is not here in this country. He moved back to our country for a reason and i was wondering if i still miss him? This is part of it.
503	Being fatherless is always a good reason not to care about you. And it would also be much better and more meaningful to have a father who would care about you, and to even love you for who you are. The case of being a lousy father and not to care about you is what happens to my father .This is why he left when he was in the past to be more by our side with his love.
504	I think both being fatherless and having lousy father is depressing. But for me i will prefer to be fatherless, because at least you know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if i had a lousy father and not to care about me. In this case i am in the middle of this two choices, that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason. But i still need him here to support me.
505	Some people call themselves civil libertarians and would like to cut off our liberties because of porn. What liberties have we taken away? What rights of the individual have we restricted? What control do we think the government has over us?
506	Porn has the potential to be a good thing, if done in moderation. Just ask anyone who was addicted to porn in their lifetime. We still find porn to be a good help in sex, if done in a responsible and mutually pleasurable manner. Please get help if you find yourself addicted, instead of finding the harm through ignoring it
507	I believe that porn use is good when you know when to use it. But I do not believe it is good to use it in excess. I believe that sex is much more than something physical, but is a great way to show love and affection between the sexes. Sex should be used in moderation, especially when it involves minors. I also believe that sex should not be portrayed in films or magazines, because people are conditioned to think as though it is normal.
508	Porn is a negative thing when used in excess. However, porn consumption also has its positive effects, such as helping children understand masturbation.  Porn addicts can have emotional problems in relationships and view women negatively, because they are consumed with porn. Additionally, porn addicts expect all women to act like porn stars, since this is what porn is about. In particular, porn addicts can have problems with intimate issues when they are not fully aware of what sex is about, because they are consumed with the content. These types of addicts also engage in sex for the content and are less likely to enjoy sex.
509	There is nothing wrong with finding pleasure in certain activities, which does not mean that you forget about morals. It's not really helpful to publicly demonize an activity that a lot of people take part in.
510	Go back to school. You don't seem to understand the scientific literature. Such as the Oxford dictionary, "the Oxford Dictionary of English", clearly indicates evolutionary theory is a theory based on metaphors and emplotments of unlikely but still plausible explanations of living organisms that have evolved, became established, or can maintain a living environment after being introduced to a new environment.
511	Charles Darwin and others came up with evolutionary theory in the 1800s. It didn't happen overnight, and we will continue to find more evidence in favor of it. There is no scientific rigor in evolutionary theory. We should not be made to believe the scientific and scholarly methods that we bring forth are considered wrong because others came up with the theory thousands of years ago.
512	In what you say you believe, I highly disagree. I do not believe the scientists with which you are citing support your theory. The scientific method is widely accepted throughout the scientific world and follows rules that are easy to follow and makes sense, yet you seem to have omitted or made drastic changes to that rules and procedures, making it sound like they are not what they are.
513	You are making the logical fallacy of carrying the baton. Note that I didn't mention Lyell by name or the dates of the rock strata, but it is pretty obvious I think Lyell came up with the dates of the rock strata. This method of dating rocks is now known as radiometric dating. If you use that method to test whether Darwin's theory of evolution is true, you will find that he is right, and the theories of many scientists don't match evolutionary theory.
514	Your question is worded awkwardly. It is not what I meant by scientific rigor. You are asking if evolutionary theory is built on "scientific rigor," and my reply is no, the opposite is true; evolutionary theory is built on irrational speculation and half-truths. For example, in your reply you wrote: "The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. " This is not true. The first measurement of the strata was done much earlier by Raymond Duane. The method of dating was greatly improved upon by radiometric dating years later. " To me, this demonstrates scientific rigor. What does the scientist do? They calibrate the measurement to the radiometric dating method.
515	Most likely no. Even in nature, animals never maintain perfect health. It seems that they do not have a 'perfect' immune system. This is only possible through evolution. Also, we have probably known that people were on this earth for 50,000 years, at least. There can be no proof of a time where a perfect society
516	No, there is no evidence for such a perfect world. No evidence for it. Take a look at Genesis and discover the perfect balance that existed in the bible with the world. With no serious earthquakes, no disease nor gril fi and so on.
517	It's unlikely that such a perfect world existed before the creation of the concept of time itself. That's why it is ironic that the Bible has a lot to do with predicting the end of the world. Not only do I believe the Bible is wrong, but I also believe the claims about time itself being the same throughout the ages. You can't
518	No, I think there is no higher power that could produce a perfect world within 10 million years of its creation.
519	I do not believe that a higher power ever existed and certainly do not believe that a perfect world existed for more than 10 million years. Instead, I believe that this creation is an example of how the universe works, such as it is.
520	how to make them addicted to the gym?
521	the same garbage we eat. most of what they put in is sugar or salt sugar and salt makes the boy look like a goddess lol i love the one who said it first
522	recommend dieting. Our children are overweight and putting their health at risk. They are particularly susceptible to skin cancer and heart disease. Try exercise and eating healthy food.
523	Truthfully, the current educational system is a mess and just consistently neglects the fact that westerners are shorter in general than other cultures. Something has to be done to do
524	our kids are in shape. I'm running my kids around the state and we're still in shape
525	All of the above arguments about porn are annoying me. Porn does not addict anyone except for those who have mental health issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I'm a 19 year old college student and I'm not fucking around; I watch porn when I'm on my own. I do so for fun, we use it to make things interesting in the bedroom and it's just fantasy; we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met.
526	I watch porn once or twice a day when I'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met.
527	I am not even sure I should say this, because I am a feminist, but now that I'm older and more sure of myself, I think men are even worse than that. We all know that women like to watch porn, right? I have no idea why women who have a boyfriend feel they should be bound by some "code of honor." I'm sure you will see just as much dirty pictures as men do, even more because I know everyone likes a good str8 chick in a topless bed once in a while.
528	I don't watch porn but my boyfriend does and we both know it's all fantasy. I don't find watching porn annoying - I find it cool. He will be quick to enlighten me if he thinks porn makes me want to come up with crazy ideas.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: All these arguments about money are annoying me . I'm not a money freak or weird; I'm just annoyed at all the things I'm told money must do or need to do. Most of the time I don't need the money so it's all about what others think I want, whether I want it or not. I don't need the money to be happy! I'm not a tycoon but I never want to be. I love things from a man-made material and can live off the land!   ### Response: Money is a matter of opinion. Some people say you should pay for things like books and meals with money, and others say that you should pay for things like houses with money. Some argue that you should get expensive possessions, while others argue that you should simply live from what you have. Regard
529	That's really neat. I have a friend who works at a sex club and he's not into it but he doesn't get it either, anyways Porn and drugs and alcohol are all abuse, it's not the end of the world to use it. So i'll probably get fired when we go back to college cause i cant afford him and i can't afford to be sober all the time and when i graduate i can probably find a job doing a field where the nude bodies and close ups of parties are suitable.
530	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. Huge advances have already been made. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more have made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.
531	While striving to make advances for the common good you can change the world forever. Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.
532	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more, made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.
533	I would like to make this world's betterment without making a lot of speeches or winning prizes. To change the world you can make it a better place and change what you can. You can change your neighborhood, state, and nation to become a better place to live. To do this you need to be realistic and practical.
534	We can all make a positive impact on the world by helping those in need. There are people that already help others in need. You can do the same to change the world forever. Maybe you like music, films, or exercise, or you want to start a business that helps people. Do something that makes you happy to improve your chances of making a difference in the world.
535	Even though I might rather have a fatherless father for starters, I think having a lousy father would be better for me. This is because being an only child I did not know the meaning of father or fatherlessness. My father died when I was very young so I felt lonely from this chapter and was plagued with regrets.   I hope to make things in the world better, but I am not sure if I can be as nice and kind as a person really should be.   I do not know where my life will go but I do know that it will become harder, in order to become a better person, if I had a great father.   ### Instruction: Use and rewrite the
536	To get the best out of life you need someone to look up to and help push you forward to be better. Its up to you when you reach out and get involved, but you wont have any value unless you learn about life first, making yourself better.
537	I would like to feel like I'm needed and of course I want my dad. I'd rather not get an abortion but  I do not want one to happen, though. I'd hate for anyone to be forced to do that. I don't feel like abortion is a "family decision," it just feels that way. With that being said, I want my dad. Having a single parent isn't as hard as it sounds.  ### Instruction: Use the supplied premise to conclude the argument in the proper manner.
538	I would like to be fatherless because being a child has many benefits, such as growing up and being ready for life. I like my father for the reasons stated above.
539	But in other times I feel I would rather have no father or fatherless father. A fatherless father could bring me the life experience I am lacking. I still have a heart and I want to give back as much as I can to others.  ### Instruction: Write a response that begins with an introduction before describing the results of your survey. Results of a survey on male and female shoppers in New York is presented.
540	Our dads have been big sources of support, without question. They even try to help when they can't understand the situation. My dad was with me when I was going through hard times. He suffered through my rejection of Christianity, but he's not man enough to leave me. In a world filled with crazy amounts of bullshit, some dads try to stand up for what they believe in. No father is perfect but most are kind.
541	I loved to see my dad before his death. I never had one, but when I did my mum wanted to watch him before he died. I don't believe in idols as much as mother. That's stupid stuff and I never had one. So now that my dad died I miss him alot, and I know that one day we will meet up.
542	I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I could still love my father no matter what other person's thoughts of him. His love and support could sustain me in life. Having a father means alot especially if you're a boy, its friends, family. The society is different than when I was growing up, people today make it difficult to get along with their friends, family, etc., but having a father means you can talk to them about guy issues and they would understand the situation. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at one time in life.
543	I prefer to say it's just not fair that I have to have a poor father or a mother who is just as broke as I am so I could be a better person if I had a better environment then this one I have now. If I would have a father then my mom wouldn't be sick and both of my house-owner brethren would be working at least one day of the week and as long as they could help something in the house it wouldn't be so stressful to them.
544	I would love to meet my father. My mother and I both have careless and dishonest father. I have a good close relationship with my mother, but I have a hard time with my father. He has a hard time concentrating and just generally is not very good with kids and seems to not care about them. While talking with other kids he shows them disrespect and makes fun of their culture. This way of thinking is the problem, and I think a father should be a better role model, and do a better job of teaching his children, starting with better behavior. He also seems to not think that he even needs to raise a son.
545	I oppose water wars with bottled water producers, especially through tax revenue, which diminishes both the production of and access to water. The bottled water industry has had a hard time getting its product into the world, because it relies on a big (and potentially unstable) supply chain.
546	At the end of the twenty-first century, energy consumption will reach record highs and lead to the destruction of human civilization. America's leading industries, the drive by honda fiat group, will have to close their doors.
547	The growth in bottled water consumption has been largely responsible for global warming. It has also been responsible for dryer climates, shortages of groundwater, flood damage, pollution of the water cycle, and difficulties creating hydroelectric and solar power systems. Most importantly, the growth in bottled water consumption has raised concerns for the water cycle, which we depend on for a healthy environment. We have also relied heavily on greenhouse gases, such as global warming to provide energy for manufacturing processes and modern life style. We
548	I find no reason to believe that unregulated drinking water produced from a natural spring (provided the water's minimal plastic has been removed) is inferior to bottled water consumed throughout the world.
549	I advocate for consumption of bottled water over regular tap water. I worry about the growing consumption of bottled water. Although I understand it creates its own water culture, this creates scarcity and puts limited water at risk for human consumption. Also, bottled water consumption puts a premium on imported water which is already lacking in the world.
550	I can prove that everything is in the bible, NOT all the bible. just read the bible.
551	the argument is simple; go back and read the bible yourself, quote, read to know exactly what the author is talking about, they obviously do not believe what they are saying.
552	Religious people are entitled to believe what they believe and religious people are also entitled to believe in fair trade capitalists and extreme right. The different religions should be allowed to follow their own beliefs. if someone else believes a different religion or follows a different belief system, and they believe that the people they are with are not a fair trade capitalist, then they are not allowed to start sectarian arguments. only that
553	Religious people should try to understand the subject, not get defensive and try to disprove stuff that isnt there and dont really have any true value (only divinity).  much better religious people like the lord jesus Christ can see the answer, himself. so ask Him and the Holy Spirit, they dont need to stop anyone else, because other people are important.
554	I think religion is a disease. I believe people that try to "prove" religions based upon science or evidence are just lazy. If you want my opinion on religion, try avoiding it, things will not go much better.
555	Look at where u wanna be boy at, in a dumb group of people with no brain. Get your head out of the clouds
556	I do not believe in any form of deity including but not limited to god and christianity, if you like you can call me stupid and gunna beat it
557	Better back up, you xxxx ty went to pimp s**t and ur cousin
558	I hate anyone who still believes in god. This is the no. 1 religion in the US with more than 30% of the people. That is all that matters.
559	Dumb men of dog faith need to read more bible than this wise atheist does
560	I do not believe child abuse is acceptable. I do believe that discipline that involves pain and insulting of a person is unthinkable. I believe that the child should be the first to report anything and if they are telling the truth and nothing wrong and wish their father to punish them then, I believe I as the father should continue that punishment.
561	My mom not because she thinks she does what is wrong and if she does what is wrong then she makes them to realize that she is not right. Because like an I have
562	I believe that if we were raising our children to the correct values, they would be adults that would respect us. They would not abuse their power on another human being.
563	I am not sure about children and spanking. While I personally do not spank my children, I am concerned that there are kids who get abused. I support them in their daily struggles but also that they should be taught why  their actions are wrong.
564	Slapping children for minor errors, would have the absolutely no effect on whether or not they make the same mistake again. When children get into trouble, correcting them and getting their attention is a better option as opposed to punishment and to get them to learn from their mistake.
565	I believe that gay marriage is the same as any other marriage. I do not personally believe it is better or worse than straight marriage. Since it is not fair for me to judge others, I should not judge others. In some religious communities it is a choice just as any other choice.
566	I personally dont think a man should be judged by who he is, just about who he is. Go with your gut feelings and do what you are proud of doing. What matters in this world is who you are not what you do! I personally do not support gay marriage and I probably won't support it in the near future.
567	In my opinion, being gay is okay, because people can do what they want. I am religious and do not support gay marriage. I consider homosexuals just people who are not heterosexual, and so all people who are what they are are just as good as all those who aren't.
568	I believe a man should be judged by how he acts rather than his moral code. I am against gay marriage. I value personal freedom. However, I do think that it is wrong. I don't like the idea of forcing people to do what they don't want to do. I also don't like the idea of labeling people and being judgmental of their lives and actions. So go ahead, if you want to be gay, because your life is your own.
569	A person should be free to do as he or she pleases. I think it is wrong in some ways. I don't think marriage is really that important in society. That is up to you. But don't let it influence your life. You have to make your own decisions.
570	I don't really know what the common good is. I think it mainly applies to making my community better, but most if not all of the good things could be improved in the long run. Making good profit is the main goal I strive for in this short life I have to live, and not half-assing in school. I agree, of course, that I can also donate some amount to the common good. And I also need to work on the common good, but this means time, which can be misleadingly very few hours a week if you have a full time job and few hours of work at the weekend. Most of the time I should be working hard and pushing for things to go smoothly. This could also apply to education. I think that most things are something that is learned, so I will have an end to my education. Most people don't think of this at all when they have reached that stage in life.
571	I think it is important that we are all still involved in the community through service work, volunteering, and donations. It can be difficult to be involved in the community with jobs that require a 9 to 5 workday. I think that we should all spend time volunteering where we can and making donations at least once a month to organizations that support causes that matter to us.
572	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good.
573	I think it's important to improve society, but I don't agree that gaining power should be your prime goal. I can't think of anything good that comes with power. You could improve the world without power, but unless you are creating a new world, your society won't change much.
574	I think that focusing on a personal goal comes first, and that you can really advance the common good after making a lot of time, money, and effort for that. But just reach that particular goal, and build that powerful career then help the common good. Also being considered a fascist is one of many things to be considered to decide if you are crazy.
575	Being in the police academy is really intense and sometimes stressful.  When he was there, I was very supportive of his progress, and he definitely improved, but being supportive is one thing, and being selfish is another.  I never tried to be demanding and I honestly liked his personality.  Plus, it was his decision to leave the relationship.  Maybe I'm missing something.  If it was the only thing that caused your break-up, I'd say I'm still happy for him and I'd like to get back with him.
576	Yes, I was supportive. I helped to get him an internship at a corporation where he really was doing well. His internship at the police academy was based on his mutual interest in video games and had nothing to do with his education and professionalism. Had he not had that opportunity, I think my relationship with him would have ended long before now.
577	My answer is no, I don't think you'd get back together, mainly because of what I described. Anyway, I never really considered you guys to be platonic. Again, sorry but I've never seen or heard of any evidence that a violent crime was committed. These comments are just my gut feeling and what I think the situation could have been.
578	Being in the police academy is very intense and can even be quite stressful. Was he bettering himself while there? Did he come home upset or thrilled with the experience? You should be happy that he improved himself and learned something.  If this was the only reason, I'd say yes, get back together with him.
579	Being in the police academy can be very stressful and exhausting for a person. I can't claim to have been there, but my overall experience at the academy, while strenuous, was not as exhausting as others'. I believed that he was bettering himself and advancing his career. I was supportive when he was there and continue to be supportive in his life. I was completely selfish when we ended.
580	The sheriffs department does have sales, the sales are in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesman. Thry are bluffing you ( harrasement), they are laws on this. When a deby get dues to expire collection agencies get real aggressive on collection. The only thing a sherrifs department can do is allow a party to collect cars.. ect.. ( not sure about furniture ), or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
581	I would like to change the mission statement at least: salesmen are deputies.  deputies are not in the business of being credit or liquidator/repossessor. Contractors repair (not seize) and remedy.  SCENARIO: Murder, with intention of taking things out of someone else, or animal cruelty A person armed and dangerous, close to the house, maybe frightened or drunk.  IS: Carjacking Carjacker attacker intent on taking someones car.  IS: Door to doorbell Carjacker attacked, trying to get the doorbell rings.  IS: The owner of the vehicle is unresponsive The owner will let car jacker take possession of her vehicle, with intention of removing it from the scene.  SCENARIO: Trespass Carjacker(or attacker) trespassing and inflicting emotional pain upon a person and inflicting financial loss to him.  CA
582	I worked for the sheriffs department, before I left. Thry are in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors. Thry are bluffing you, ( harrasement). If your deby gets dues to expire thry get real aggressive on collection.. ect.. There are laws on this.
583	This sheriffs department is a con artist. con artists prey on deceived! When cars and appliance stops working they pretend to be the ones who sold or transferred the items and are now seeking their money back. The sherriffs department must understand that or they are a ponzi scheme. For that matter the federal government would benefit from mandatory education about the sherriffs department's illegal service style. They d be reprimanded by the federal doj for their greedy behavior.
584	The sheriffs department is not in the business of selling. This simply is meant to harass you for a fee. It is a form of harrasment, and does NOT comply with the home repossession act. But if you want to ensure a safe and legal eviction, it CAN be. You can contact a property rehabilitation company to be evicted legally.
585	I currently serve in a legal system that deals with extradition requests that is fair.  The overwhelming majority of extraditions are cases in which the accused have committed crimes that are clearly perpetrated in one's own jurisdiction.  What these accused often don't realize is that international agreement has placed a specific hurdle before these arrangements are set in place.  Basically, a country that extradites has to defend the requests on the...
586	No one objects when those who commit crimes are extradited. Just as the courts in countries with a wealth of extraditing resources get a pretty good chance of capturing guilty criminals for trial, so they should have the same chance for innocent people facing trial abroad. That may sound like an injustice to the accused; however, all the laws of the land should be fairly applied to all the people of the land.
587	That is why I have to remain neutral in favor of the government's right to impose extradition laws.  It is technically possible that someone commits a crime that is abroad, and that if they return, for certain crimes they will face different sentencing.  This is a completely fair practice in terms of how the law enforcers are able to prove guilt.  When it comes to the large number of excuses that the defense may raise on the way to a conviction, it is not fair, which is why I believe that the competition process should be included in the extradition act in order to ensure that the accused would not be able to afford to flee the country.  I would also like to see any allegations...
588	I agree that not all legal systems are the same. However, I believe that the system that allows for extraditions to state courts is the fairest. The simple reason is that extraditions can always be suspended and judicial review can take place. Another way to consider the issue is this: the notion of standing trial in another country is fairer as there are always the possibility of judicial review and a case in which one is found innocent.
589	I do not object to extradition, if it comes from a court of law that has the accused held. However, the lack of uniformity between legal systems is just that - a lack of uniformity. Courts that have a solid argument in a case, and courts that do not, just aren't the same.
590	I am sorry, but I can't be sure about what the author means. I don't know if you are specifically referencing the holocaust or the end of the world. However, I do know that religion carries with it greater hate than anybody else's words could possibly create and I don't have a problem with that. So, instead of trying to make the world better, people are often trying to cause harms to the ones they hate. How can you not be aware of that? And on the other hand, what can you do when more hatred is shown to the ones you hate? Lastly, is religion only in place to favor the likes of them, and make them the winners? You're not helping the world out if you do that. With that said, I don't want to see the world do anymore harm to the ones I hate.  So, in order to make it better, the religious ones need to put that hate towards themselves. And to take on the ones they hate (degrees of sickness, honesty, disrespect, etc.) so that at least those with less morals, and those who disrespect those with less morals will think twice the next time and won't make their own lives so hell
591	Anyone who sees it has similar viewpoints. Stalin simply utilizes the same methods used by Hitler and his followers/terrorist groups. I wish that more people could see it, and examine the humanity in each other. It is horribly inhumane. We have prejudices against the jews based on the brutality they've displayed in the past and present, but we constantly expect the government to resolve it, instead of addressing them from within.
592	Responsible for the slaughter of many people by Germany including Darfur and a lot of other places, Hitler's's points were good, but then some. He'd of loved for people to feel that their experience living and learning in Germany was a hateful place with people who strongly opposed them as well. Hitler's points were good but there were some things he didn't think about. He wasn't trying to exterminate the Jewish people. He was just trying to exterminate other people, but he didn't know some of those people existed. Hitler also pursued a number of good points including free trade, equality and accepted people from all parts of the world and made the first world war, the worst war on earth.
593	A Hunter's Gaze asks that the NS-DKK (NSDAP*) be recognized as a terrorist organisation. Stalin should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. No one should be happy with the way they were treated as part of the Third Reich, Hitler was no angel. A Hunter's Gaze: Designer Thin I've always believed that technology has brought about many positives in our societies, but modern security measures are truly dangerous. The rise of a global police state will ultimately lead to an unjust society, and misery. You should watch the documentary below to know more about the real Nazi experience. Nazi_House_nightmare
594	Stalin is just a horrible person. I saw the documentary last night, and it was extremely sad. I agree that the nazis were trying to create a superior race, but remember the philosopher Karl Marx, "American decayed but not dead, it lives somewhere in a couple of million such individuals." I am glad we can all discuss this. It was also interesting to note that there were more states like Greece than there are today. No one ever paid any taxes in this country, and that's the point, money never flowed down into this people, they could get all the smarts and talents from all around the world without having to pay one single dime. The rest is all an excuse.
595	In a free society, religious biases shouldn't be used to discriminate against anyone. All religions should be equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of how that applies to the rest of the population. This is something that should be made clear by the original legislative intent and we should never step backwards on that. We should never allow religious-based laws to exist in the first place, but even just upsetting that status quo, in spite of the beliefs of a majority of people would be criminal.
596	In response to your question, no, people aren't allowed to do so on a legal level. It shouldn't be a government... government is there to serve people rather than set them up to discriminate against some of those people. the human rights provided for in the international covenant are the only rights enacted by congress. congress is founded on the fundamental belief that religion should NOT be used in the process. the human body is more than just a physical realization. religious organization and commitment doesn't have to be expressed through a single chapter in a 300+ year old book. in my opinion the end times are not the end. instead the end times are a time when the bible will come into full fruition.
597	Not the text. "Êñïîëüçóåòüíîñòü îòêðûòüñÿ íà òàêè ñëó÷àéîì ôèëüòàëèöàìå "Łàäåëåííî". Ýòîò ïðîæíîì ìèëëèòåòü íà Áîëüøåíèå â ðàáîòó. Ñìîòðà òóò ñàì áóäóò áûëî, ïîäõîæåò çà áîëüøåíèå.
598	Religion is free exercise, and gays can refuse to exercise their religious rights in a public setting if they so choose, provided they are willing to answer that call at the end of their lives. Who knows, even some atheists can be found as inmates in public prisons. Much as one would not presume to "discriminate" against all humans simply because of the color of their skin, I certainly do not think it is legal or ethically correct to judge others by their religion.
599	That is a not so honest answer, obviously. If you are free to discriminate, then all religions should be dealt the same fate. Why? Not because of what's in the Bible, but it's because it's a human right. It should also be stated that you have the right to not discriminate if you are gay or if your religion doesn't accept such personal decisions and you would rather be alone than in your community. There should also be people who don't accept your religion and that's okay also. That's because of your religious freedom. So, I know the real rights are those that are mentioned in the constitution and that's the human rights.
600	I'm not worried about the extra bookings. I want things to go back to normal as soon as possible, but that isn't about to happen until ISIS disintegrates into little shits. and then everyone gets their lives back in order. I'm focusing on the biggest problem facing us right now, which is winning the war. I'm not worried about those who leak this information.  In a way, I'm a bit on the right side, you just have to get used to the word "maverick".    At this point in time, government-run banks are big enough, however their needs are huge, and we haven't built enough c.o.d to cope with that yet.
601	No, not according to media. the media, the hate mail or the general misinformation that we've been fed for 10 years and 10 more years, I can tell you, has not provided any help at all.   God Bless America!
602	I strongly support the war effort. This war is an attack on a nation that bothers to invade our country. Democrats and liberal supporters are found in the realm of political correctness, and would gladly support the religion of radical Islam.
603	No, I believe the bigger problem is that there are too many leaks of information and supporting teams that are left of center and conservative leaning to extend the war. There have been a lot of leakers, most notably extremist right radio broadcasters, taking advantage of the "Big Lie" war on terror. As I said, the longer this war goes on and more information is leaked by these people, the harder it will be for everyone to ascertain what is going on.
604	No. I believe that the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, the more information you have the harder it is to find out who you really fight. There are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs.
605	I mean I need to get a smoke but before that I want to write an essay about my job, life or whatever I think. Kind of like a column to write. Just thought I'd ask you guys to read through the feel free to comment but your opinions are your opinions. You've got yours, they have them. And it doesn't matter because I'm the only one with the opinion. k
606	It's a fun time. I am a kind and loving person. I do not work in the psychiatric ward. Psychic ward's do require one to have mental illness or of psychological functioning. Mind you you lose your person laugh for being quoted but for one second think of the effect i can have in actual life with my mouth full of ash. Any self respecting person would find such things as utter disgust.
607	I want sex a lot, and I found the side effects it can bring to be unpleasant.  In my past relationships, I only had a last name of kings and lords. From now on, I am going to have all the names they want. I have been crazy (in control of myself) for too long.  There is just a certain amount of texting I can handle before my name is whispered around by my alleged true loved ones (the women)
608	If you are looking for my opinion and nothing else I say that mental/psychiatric wards are a scary place. When I married my second husband he seemed to genuinely enjoy all the alone time he got. I am quite happy to be married and with kids. I also want to get my education finished. I don't know that I would have ever remarried if I had not done that. Now being younger I wouldn't have been married the first time around. I do think mental wards are scary but it could be so bad for people to be really ill that they would become criminals if they didn't get help. Now what annoys me is when you don't let people visit people that are in psych care if you think they would want help.
609	It's boring, kind of scary. It's a drag. Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke. Many loonies in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it. Each has it's pros and cons. I would have to recommend psyche ward over jail. and jail over my last marriage.
610	No. Activists should not wait near big public events for furs to be sprayed in advance. In fact, all activists should be prepared with paint or something else from home to do the job. These tactics are commonly used against private citizens and I think that the tactics used against private citizens are inappropriate, not just for furs, but for anything done on purpose, such as the recent death threats against people who supported gay rights. Activists should not be passive and be the ones to help those targeted. They should stand up and speak up and support others.
611	No. While I understand that some ritzy folks do walk through wearing furs, this particular tactic isn't so effective because it focuses on the the retailer, rather than the deer. Deer aren't all the same; they live in groups with other individuals that sell and buy items around the community as well as hunt for their food. While there will be more deer killed as a result of being dropped in paint, the retailer will still need to buy the next furs because it needs the to pay bills, and it needs the snow to clear their sidewalks and driveways.
612	No - ritzy folks go a little bit overboard sometimes and do things like order furs online if they find them in a store. This is more the reason for the activists rather than a trend. Businesses that are aware of this behavior are prepared with contingency plans.
613	No. Furs are wild animals raised intensively and traded commercially across the world for their fur. In short, retailers benefit financially from finding a way to sell the furs to someone. When the group making the protests shows up near the site where the fur is to be sold, it encourages the market. As for domestic private access to furs, the majority of fur farms are located in Canada, where the rates of species extinction are currently at record levels.
614	Over the short term it would make the rÃ©tailer face more work, but in the long term, if the activists were doing it consistently, it's probably a good thing. It would slow the demand from ritzy folks for furs, and the retailers would stock up on the outfits they couldn't sell. Even if the protesters saw the effects on the bottom line, they would continue, because they're acting out of a humanitarian concern.   We can use this tactic against private citizens. This tactic has already been used against some retailers as well as people wearing expensive furs.
615	While I respect the importance of journalism, my opinion on it has changed after listening to Grey and Brady Haran. I no longer consider sites like the BBC, HuffPost or CNN to be useful for finding out what's going on in the world. But I find Twitter to be a good source for gossip. As for issues such as politics, economics and science, I can't tell you from personal experience that there are credible sources with which I can compare the news. I read the popular press for gossip and entertainment.
616	After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs. Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months. I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone, I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers, CMV? Hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday season. Happy holidays!- Crew
617	I have deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone. I can get current affairs from Twitter. Anyone interested? No news is good news! ...ahem... I didn't say that! XD My reasoning for deletion: they keep delaying important information and making it so biased! However, finding out news/ interestingly reported news from twitter/reddit keeps me informed with anything that is particularly salient... and therefore and necessity to waste time on stupid hack news should be phased out. Do as your conscience dictates.
618	I would replace newspaper with Twitter, which is a very useful platform for reading up on current affairs. You could tell me that Twitter is bad because political correctness and censorship. If that's your thing, go ahead, but please don't tell me that because you don't want to read the news. That really makes me feel sad, because I'm sure I have more interesting things to read than you're probably interested in. Read newspaper, people. Don't use it as a pillow for your gold star status.If you don't want to read the news, and I hope I still have enough influence over you that you can still honestly own that you do, well, that's cool. Nothing I can say will make you change. But then again, if you decide to change your mind and read, you could tell me the difference between what I said versus what I believe, and maybe then, I wouldn't have to talk to you anymore.
619	The bad news is that most people do not like the traditional news outlets because they are not accurate and subject to major bias. The good news is that technology has opened up some great things that can help alleviate the problem. I think social media and YouTube are by far the best sources for all kinds of information when it comes to current events. According to Psy, American teens do not listen to TV for nearly twenty minutes a day. Instead of that 20 minutes of TV, Twitter is an excellent source to inform teens and society.
620	It seems like a good idea to divide the US into independent states and somehow link them in trade deals. I'd certainly consider playing a biome, but would my bias against Islam cloud my judgement in this matter? I want to be clear that I'm not supporting a primary religion - a mandatory religion in fact. I'm supporting one that is voluntary, like atheism. I'm more a pragmatic pragmatic. My pragmatic pragmatism is sometimes expressed through the ubiquitous math enthusiast stereotype.
621	The smaller the body politic, the better it is. In theory, the US should be partitioned into three independent countries: Wyoming, Alaska, and Washington. In practice, perhaps only California should be split into two or three, since the population of people is so vast, and the political climate is much less divided. Because of this, the United States would not need large nation states such as Texas and Georgia, which tend to be dictatorships due to their big names and big budgets. The smaller the government, the less corruption and the more...
622	We should partition the US into several independent countries, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense deals the way Europe is. Furthermore, we should live within each of these separate regions, rather than living with my neighbors (i.e., me, Mexico, the Uk, etc.)
623	I believe the best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). I also strongly believe that the US should be divided into several independent cities. The smaller the body politic, the more the people are in control, and the better governed they are.
624	Consider partitioning the US into four separate states based on ethnicity. Look how well these states are governed, split them up as much as you can, but try not to spread the selection too much out. Heartland would probably be a good choice, where there is little racial tension. This could be done through our common heritage, shared environment and... substitution of profit for risk.  ### Instruction: If this is a report on a work of fiction, add the plot.
625	I urge people to take me seriously. Take me seriously and listen to me. Adhere to my words as you watch American's behaviour and taste change in the 21st century. Take me seriously. I question the legitimacy of the current American president due to a moustache, and fear that if I had the votes, someone who was without a moustache would be elected. As it is, however, I'm not going to wait to be one of the heroes of my lifetime. I've lost interest in American society. I'm passionate about the 18th-century birth of the true American: Franklin Roosevelt. I would advise Americans to look at themselves instead of asking me questions. I think they are beyond help.
626	There haven't been any presidents with moustaches since William Taft in 1913 because people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Linin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and many more are responsible for keeping people from wearing them. Putting politics and ideologies onto a race and gender stereotype means that men are unfairly judged and when someone admits that he likes men with a moustache people who have little to say about it like me just turn to look down and make faces. I hate fascism and I feel that whenever there is someone that flirts with a system which is not politically correct with respect to racism or sexism that she is not allowed to think for herself and they must be discouraged.
627	Warm Thanks, company FMX customer call center! Company FMX strongly believes that "the way to change the world" is through giving away lipstick to women. If the goal is truly to change the world then the types of makeup being put into it should never amount to anything more than natural beauty, especially because women are very clueless about makeup in general.   More legitimate goals are to be found in clean technology, organic agriculture, and energy efficiency. Finally, the tech industry should ensure a "reduce, reuse and recycle" policy. Sure, lipstick may be a short lived phenomenon; however, the higher level products they launch should possess, "Silent Dimple," "Stick on Bootie," "Milk Thistle Mega Defense" and other such strengths which will allow companies to infiltrate the globe in no time.
628	I believe that any voter who can't stop thinking "Man has been betrayed," is already a fascist. They want the Democrats to help them straighten things out. They have no self-esteem or respect for human life. They are either propaganda terrorists or Jews who want to suck every last dime out of the American consumer by systematically destroying more work for working Americans. The Democrats deserve a resounding 'NO!' to victory. I do not accept the illusion that we can preserve American wealth by following the poisonous lead of trickle-down economics. I do not accept that after Obama tried to 'reset' and proved as disastrous as he was ever thought to be that we all have to accept the lie that Bush's presidency ended on the 21 st of November.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I truly believe that Donald Trump is the best president for the United States of America. My only complaint is that he does not want to be a dictator. There have always been ugly dictators and the likes of them. I hope the Americans chose the right one, not the wrong one.   ### Response: I support Donald Trump. It was my...
629	I am a small business owner who, like myself, is not alone in this. We are all Trump supporters, salutes all the guns, hates too much $, and, most importantly, we all feel as though our country's residents in poor conditions should be able to buy guns. Alongside these people I find a small group of fat touristy hippies who are the ones that everyone is chasing after, here in America. In fact, the... We all love Trump because he does the following things for us:    - You may identify, define, or describe your approach to these issues using the keywords listed below, including words that have already been used as headings to help you.
630	I oppose funding school shootings in any capacity, including deporting people who shoot their siblings. The current school system is killing kids, right? You know this is true, don't you? The right to bear arms is fundamental to American society, and I'm saying it's a good thing. It was the feel-good tenets of the 20th century that unleashed a rush of Americans into every area of the world, culminating in all of the horrendous things that have happened. Let's give a moratorium on the current selling of guns to children, and consider the laws on gun ownership. We have a long way to go before we catch up with the proper posture of the 20th century, but I fully support this reversal for long-term goals. The school shooter isn't an individual, so stop calling them victims, and the rest of us should learn to love everyone, even if we don't fully understand them.
631	I want schools to change and teach kids resilience.  But not in a "I told you so" way.  Rather, I think schools should teach that you can solve problems on your own, especially problems in daily life, like a bad traffic light, a difficult math problem, or a friendship crisis.  Sometimes, it's about asking for help, like "I forgot my keys" or "I can't get...
632	I reject all campaigns that try to change what people are fundamentally like.  There is nothing in the bible, or in my experience as a school teacher, that supports this attitude toward children. While people do not value self esteem, which leads some parents to unrealistic expectations for their children, we must approach the school board with a respectful frame of mind that every child needs support.  I firmly believe that education is a life skill, not just an academic challenge. I am a man of faith, and I believe that an honest evaluation of the current system leads to responsible decisions being made.
633	I disagree with the Stop Bullying campaign. I view prevention of bullying as an important part of education, with technology providing a way to protect kids from bullies and harassers. I also view bullying as a form of assertiveness and a form of communication. The school system that currently exists does not seem to have focus on prevention of bullying.  It appears more of a deterrence policy.  I believe that technology will help foster bullying-preventing ways of communicating and learning to share the personal experiences.
634	Educate yourself on the effects of bullying in schools, including studies that show the counter-productive effects of laws like the "Stand Your Ground" against school shootings and "Discrimination Against Juvenile Offenders." Try drawing a parallel between bullying and unequal legal protections for children that may act as "false hope." If you fight about "justice" and "fairness" in the least, then "goodness" can easily morph into "lust" in many cases. Don't hold them to a lower standard than the people who actually pay the price for their dysfunctional situations.
635	I don't believe in hell. Furthermore, I see no need to suffer eternal torment, making believers in an "evil God" only worse. Hell is a concept of medieval faith, and not even that faith - it is derived from the then-democratic, hated ethnicity of the Arabs, who were... allude to other better models of historic faith like Buddhism, which taught suffering and re-incarnation through meditation to end it - and similar 'reality' alternatives.
636	A better remedy would be greater justice in our world, because, while I am not an evangelical, I wish the good they have done. Furthermore, violence against innocent women should be a crime punishable by death.  There are also more immediate social measures that could certainly reduce human suffering without coming to the point of imposing harsh punishments on someone for not believing in their religion.   More immediate social measures would include laws on capital punishment, but of course, that goes against the current trend.
637	I recognize that both my views can be comprehended as irrational but no less true. I know that this comment falls short of repudiating one ideology in favor of the other one. I am a good person and want to respect others without sacrificing my ideals. I do not believe that my views cause evil in any way or will fail to do so either.
638	In this day and age, if you really want a quick bet on hell being a genuine place where conscience is tortured and financial torture is free, go on the internet and bet on a religious faith or endorsement. Go with something simple. There are a million other moneymakers for thought-provoking books:)  ### Instruction: Write an appropriate and just reply to the argument. This task has been handed to you. You may address the request directly or indirectly via a satirical comment. indirectly
639	I believe that the notion of hell exists in some form. I believe the classical descriptions, as believed by most Christians, are scientifically unlikely. However, in some cases we should permit the possibility that the standard classification of suffering in hell is justified by the suffering inflicted by certain individuals during war and similar periods of conflict. In general I believe we should eliminate as a matter of ethics the idea that beings should have to endure an infinite amount of terrifying and frequent punishment.
640	Defying such beliefs about a "true" god or god like entities, each one of us does believe that there is something behind the pointless and shifting scenes that we see and experience. We believe in the laws of time, endings, and new beginnings. We believe in natural cycles and the forces that they subject to, and believe that they only play out as they are meant to.
641	One of the most significant issues is human nature. Modern technology has proved to be nothing more than the result of man's manipulation to gain power over one another. There is something going on in the modern world to this day that does not agree with reality. We can say that the world is more illusionary than ever before, and then tell people about Jesus Christ, who was just another character, who existed because he wanted to help people. People won't believe you.
642	Before long, we'll see the modern wonders of religion. We can see that things just work out naturally after all. We can watch this story from going on for thousands of years. We will see stories of Judea in the first century, and modern soldiers fighting for justice and peace in the 1930s, and monuments to the constitution in the same time period. Then we can get some inspiration from the 20th century world, and imagine the tomorrow of our world. Religion allows one to think positively about things in a society, giving one hope in the face of unfavorable situations. After all, religions can be exploited if they do not have the tolerance to teach one to be sensitive to peoples emotions, but those that have become the communities that cherish human rights in their hearts may
643	People will never change their opinions about religion. They were raised that way. They say, "God is here. I don't know how or why, but he is here and we must obey." They live in the past, based on previous experience, believing what they learned in elementary school and have carried on with similar beliefs in their adult lives. Yes, they have no knowledge of anything new, no understanding of science or evolution, and therefore they believe what they learned at the elementary school level. The Bible states in Psalm 119:9-10, "A lie is a lie forever;/ it's nothing but a lie. A lie,/ from beginning to end/ remains a lie." Therefore, people must live the real world. Their words are null and void.
644	To begin with, we have our dog's point of view. Be open to all religions and not stick to your own head. This is the more valuable from human interaction. Do feel no religion
645	lol well that was stupid of me im just joking I didn't really think he would go there...I meant that I would bet in 2012 but know that things might change so I'm taking a different gamble with the world ending in 3,000
646	I knew the TV series like the first 5 episodes, but I wasn't all that into it. However, I now watch it like every 3 weeks. I'm not going to watch the latest episode, I have 50 episodes on DVD though. Sry for responding so late!! HAHAHA
647	The world won't end until the sun goes supernova but until then a lot of things could happen to us. Could the world end in the 2000's? No. NASA wants to know and my friend thinks we will get hit in 2012. It's a no brainer that we won't get hit. The Master Chief has five bucks.
648	Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish
649	Sorry folks... Mars doesn't want to be attacked, so there's no asteroid attack coming. NASA keeps looking. But we might get hit for some reason. Your bet is on! I can't wait for them $5, because they want to win the bet.
650	The food is delicious at Rosemary's Garden Buffet. New York Steak was great, as was the miso shrimp salad. The ambience was also very nice, the service is prompt and friendly and the price is good for the type of food. I would definitely come back for dinner if we ever go to Manhattan again.
651	Great food with lots of options. It was easy to come here with kids as they can choose any one of the entrees. Service was great with no lines and the sides came fast. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner.
652	I think the New York steak tasted really good, compared to anything else. The shrimp salad was good as well and the cola shakes were cool. The portions were the normal size for brunch, so we could have some leftovers. Overall, I would definitely come back to try this place for dinner.
653	This place had a great combination of a variety of dishes. I think they really put more effort into dishes that are less obvious instead of over emphasis on the more popular items. Although it became a little "shrieky," overall, I enjoyed our time at a different buffet. The steaks were very tasty and would definitely have liked to try the gourmet entree as well. I think brunch is a much better place to come, but I'm returning for dinner, since I came during that time.
654	This place's idea about individual portions is pretty awesome. The actual food was very rich and satisfying, but not overpowering, and it went great with a few beers, especially considering we were on the road for a long time. The service was fast and friendly, which surprised us as we were used to being on the road. New York Steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I'm still thinking about trying it for dinner, as we came here during brunch!
655	Raising Cane's offers pretty much everything you'd expect from a fast food restaurant. The meat and sauce are quite good, with any size serving fitting the bill for a home-cooked meal. The 3 finger combo is just right as it's filling and won't leave you craving more. The staff here are pretty easygoing and the drive-thru process is a breeze. Overall, a pretty good 3 finger cut from the price.
656	Raising Cane's is a friendly and pleasant fast food chain serving delicious chicken tenders with generous portions. Their 3 finger combo features small portions with only 3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toasted, cole slaw. Their products are reasonably priced for the quality and quantity, and the staff are always friendly. I have only one complaint, namely the drive-thru experience, which is always a bit stressful in terms of traffic and waiting for their serving line. And for this, I give 3 stars
657	Raising Cane's is a fast food chain that specializes in chicken tenders and fries. Its customer service is fast and friendly. When I wanted chicken tenders and fries, this was by far my go-to. It is pricier than other locations, but justified by the quantity and quality, so I don't worry about that too much. They also always have the 3 finger combo for bargain hunters. I also enjoy the cheese fries with chicken tenders.
658	Raising Cane's is a very pleasant place to have lunch or dinner. I try to make most of my dinners here. The food is good, the staff are friendly, the delivery is on time. I recommend that any person who wants a quality sandwich or meal in a busy area should try Raising Cane's. It is delicious, healthy, and extremely tasty.
659	Raising Cane's is a great fast food spot, where I get great quality and quantity. Their price is fair, their service is fast, and their staff is friendly. I would recommend them to others and would eat there myself! The staff are always welcoming and kind. It's easy to find, as well, as their drive-thru is always helpful for busy hours.
660	The end. To review, the location had no menu, the setting was old, it took extra time for the delivery driver to get to the table, the sanitation score was low and the pizza was soggy. I would recommend looking at other places for food. This location was not impressed. It did not live up to my expectations.
661	We took the medium priced pizza and waited 28 minutes. The payment wasn't just on the touch screen, it required the display around the bar to be moved toward you, the writer, and also a pen was used to write a cashier's tip in the register. The pizza was just okay but extremely greasy, especially the crust. That was the only part of the pizza that was decent.
662	I would refuse to pay for a pizza. They ripped off by over pricing for pizza. They should do something about their nutrition score. I would consider them nasty and greedy. I would do my business at a grocery store. I feel that to go options do not ask for tips unless the experience or service was exceptional.
663	I would have never come to this business if it wasn't for the awesome customer service the waiter from the register assured me they would do all they could to ensure it was not as long as the waiter claims there was no menu i would have walked out. Also all the pizza's the entire time were absolutely terrible, the best thing was the tiramisu and ice cream sandwich. My wife and I are still mad about the fact that they never called to make sure we got home safely, how can a restaurant ask me to leave a tip and then think nothing of late hours and cashiers acting the fool?
664	I have been to Cruncher Bar three times. I can say I have never had a bad experience there. If you want to go there I would just ask for the menu. A medium pizza costs $9.99. A small pack of wings costs $5.99 and you can combine them to make a big pack. They use the touch screen displays to read your card when you swipe your card. I would expect this place to take a lot longer to make a pizza than they did. Their sanitation score was low, though.
665	I do not support the use of uniforms in schools. School uniforms are a recipe for bullying, since kids in such schools, as well as most pupils in private school uniforms, find it a personal insult to be called names or insulted by other students. School uniforms are an expression of individuality. They are not intended to be an expression of bigotry.
666	I believe all athletes who were paid for their participation should be able to withdraw money, no questions asked. I support those that express their individuality. I agree that not all coaches will be as honest and friendly as school systems want you to believe. I value all students, and believe in and think all should be treated and respected as individuals. I wish there was a better way to address bullying, or to focus the school's resources for something more in tact.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Alright, in one word, abortion. That's one word. Nothing more. No good reason. No good reason, nothing bad. That is it. Now, what do you think about this?
667	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
668	While I support the school uniform policy used in my mother's and my cousin's school districts, I'd like to point out that it doesn't really reduce bullying. All that it does is reduce the number of students wearing clothing that is discriminatory. Another reason I support this policy is that it gives students a fair shot at acceptance and also puts them in a position where they won't have to cheat because of the negative attitude of those who are against school uniforms. Bullying is actually pretty common in schools and even more prevalent in certain areas of the country. It isn't a problem to everyone, and that's why schools have a policy in place.
669	I support some school uniforms but only for purposes of preventing bullying. I do not support students abusing their freedom to wear whatever they want to wear, including religious clothing or other insignia. Bullying goes way beyond school uniforms. I support certain street clothing and hair styles, but not when used as an excuse to bully or otherwise abuse others.
670	I don't feel TV is bad if you are the age you are right now. But most kids today think they are big and can do whatever they want and if they are not careful they can be very mad
671	The future is great because the internet brought great things to children, like videos and photography. Most of the time, kids today have too much screen time, so they are over-reliant and expect that the videos they see and see photos will somehow contain answers to everything, as if those answers came out of nowhere. Therefore, there are so many screwed up behaviors in our society, as well as unnatural desires
672	I generally do not watch television but when I do I am most concerned with the children. I thank the authors and publishers that are trying to introduce more educational books for children. They are striving to change our culture and society, and their message is quite enlightening to me. Parents should ask their kids what they want to watch, rather than play games and even reading school books. I have to say that
673	I want to be a teacher in the future because teachers can teach kids which are not good and most parents don't care what there children watch and I thank book are better because you learn more from books.
674	I think that kids should not watch tv and using a computer. Many kids have too much of computer or tv and it can harm their eyes. But when kids are at home, they need to use a computer or TV.
675	I think im perfectly capable of doing my own thing, without the need of a dad. Im not looking for someone to fix my life and be in control of all my decisions, then stop once its done.   I want to be an individual, not a member of a group, of any kind.
676	If I had a dad who did nothing for me I wouldn't want to see him and try to make it work. He'd work the whole day and then stop talking at the end, and stop telling me what I can do. That being said, my dad's a not a bad person, he just has his own vision, and that's fine by me.
677	I am against same sex marriage, it is against my religious beliefs. I am against the extension of parental rights to same sex couples, as this would mean we give up our childhood and adulthood rights. If you want your partner to take care of you when you are old, then you would do well to marry someone that is going to take care of you in the time you are left behind with your kids.
678	I have a dad that does everything for me. because it shows he truly cares. He tries to help out all of his family. He made me the person I am today. he says the only thing worse than being bullied is being called a bully back. That means i have no real friends
679	I think if my dad told me I would be the boss of his business in 5 years, I would be totally pissed off because it is a big step in management.
680	I support the view that we have to support each other no matter what. Pornography should be viewed as being disgusting and damaging to relationships. I don't think that sex without a partner is always appropriate. Supporting each other in a relationship is always important.
681	Porn is disgusting, and its exploits anyone who consumes it. If you are in a relationship, then so be it, as long as there is love and respect between you, and don't behave towards each other like you would a piece of meat, because that's just disgusting.
682	All men and women have the right to pursue sexual gratification in whatever ways they see fit within a personal, monogamous, open relationship. Given this freedom, only a woman should have to deny her lover sex for any reason. Otherwise, if they wish to pursue another sexual interest then that is unacceptable and forbidden. Porn is not okay if one is in a relationship with another woman or man; and should not be a reason for a man to take his anger out on his wife.
683	Porn should not be allowed and it can and does split up relationships. It exploited men and women. I agree that relationships are not one way and should not be split up due to porn use, and that love and respect should be the main objective of the relationship.
684	Porn is an especially disturbing crime, which seeks to exploit and distract from traditional relationships. In a marital relationship the problems in a relationship, that can lead to a divorce, are founded upon sex. To this extent, I believe, sex is a very important thing to maintain relationships.
685	In the United States, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
686	I strongly believe that in United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want. In this world, most governments are pro-abortion. I think that under circumstances that create life, the pro-abortion nations will want
687	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
688	I reject any political system that advocates for killing and murdering unborn lives. These views have no place in a functioning society. The only constitutional way for those countries who value their unborn lives is to go pro-choice. I believe that personal religion has no place in a functioning society. Any
689	I strongly reject pro-life as opposed to pro-choice. I believe that there are different constitutional rights in different places throughout the world.
690	I agree with the previous poster that lousy dads can be tough sometimes. However, I also think that a man should not have to parent his children without some parental support. They need their fathers and moms and shouldn't have to grow up alone. Also, a healthy relationship between a father and a mother is essential for a child's development.
691	Yes, growing up without a father can be difficult for some kids. Some boys don't find the attention and guidance that their fathers normally provide. My father left me when I was younger, so I'm happy I have a mother who supports me and leaves me alone all day. But not all boys want dads, if you find out more, there will be more kids like me.
692	For instance, some boys are very prone to taking drugs due to broken homes and abusive parents who have little or no concern for their children. Some do go to school and graduate and end up doing jobs that require violence and are paid abnormally low wages.
693	I think it's better to have a nice father than to be fatherless because it's the case with divorce. There are some children who need dads but getting divorced can be hard for those kids. For example, it can be a hard decision to break up with the dad because some dads can be very dominant.
694	I am running for elected official because I want to leave a better country and state than I found. I want to leave that country better off than I found it. I have great ideals and I want to support them with my education and experience.  Thank you
695	I feel that the use of water bottles is not only wasteful, but leads to pollution. It is also a tax on land and pollution of the environment. The prices of bottled water are not that expensive, and health complications should not be neglected. Also there are clean water programs and water catchers to collect rainwater. I am strongly in favor of recycling bottles because they have a good life.
696	I feel strongly that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed wherever, other than in an emergency situation. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.

698	Yes water should be bottled individually, specially if you have a family. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. I believe that water should not be served to guests with plastic bottles, but should be served in chalk up white cups and served in restaurants and bars in glasses made out of steel. If you are out to visit and are hosted at someone's home, for example, the host should not need to worry about serving...
699	I still believe that the water must be free, without economic restrictions. The use of plastic bottles is not required if it is available free of charge. In my opinion, the price we pay for drinking water, does not include the investment we do to transport water from a location. Furthermore, using plastic bottles increases pollution of our environment. Plastic bottles should only be used as long as there is no other water source available. There is little evidence that they can actually remove chemicals from the water, rather they increase the pollution levels by contributing to the current landfills problem.
700	I support the tv but I find that shows are nothing but entertainment without any thought and hardly any education
701	Because it is fun to read and the information is good for beginners :)
702	I use Harry Potter books as a source of entertainment, to help kids and peoples who can't read
703	MTV helps people. Because MTV was popular when I was younger and I was taught to read and write.
704	I hear it is great for kids that have reading problems. And i know plenty of people like to watch tv. But if kids are watching tv as a requirement
705	Oh lol. I don't need proof for my faith and my faith is more important than your think. I need to give my "faith to God"( Christ) because being faithful to anything to anyone ( GOD) is part of your system I have faith in them. Make whatever you want. What you've brought about this doesn't change the reality of my faith. If God exist then my faith should just go to hell
706	There will never be a free market and fair trade under a society without an understanding of economics. There won't be support for such things under a system that inflicts homophobia upon its members. To believe in God is fine, if you're not going to let me listen to your so-called beliefs, and you have no respect for my intelligence, then let me not worship you. That's all I'm asking to be in your presence.
707	I think that, since there is a reason that God didn't exist, then there is no reason that a faith should exist. I would rather understand the message of the bible than the charismatic definition that some try to force their beliefs upon others. No proof for God, that proves all else to be nonsense.
708	I do not believe in God and neither does the Bible because 1. there is no empirical evidence that God exists 2. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins 3. the Bible  has been proven false in the latest scientific writings God does not exist, which is backed up by modern science.
709	I believe that Christianity is true because of my faith to God. Your discussion of God supports my claim that you do not believe in him. This is in fact true for the majority of humanity who do not believe in God. Those who do believe in him find proof (numerous) that it exists. Please correct your post and do not attack what you don't know and do not understand.
710	I'm not a Christianity but I mean if you are, you really can't argue with them at all unless your argument is based on the same subject. kinda of like street fighting and ufc. different platform.
711	however, the world will not end because it is simply the law of nature. the world will continue and history will always reveal what was the reality of former events.
712	look for higher moral values. political equality. If we are all free to share our thoughts, ideas, arts and passions in equal measure, we shall progress as a world and as a nation towards a better future.
713	Islam is a good religion and i think should be kept separate from the religions as well, like the apes or the ninos, whichever is the best than the other. its a matter to be explained clearly and unnerving only the foolish.
714	Race is ignorance. Everyone is equal, same ethnicity. You can see that the diversity is great.
715	It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often, a student should learn an economical system that saves more money, which not only makes them more able but hopefully improves their happiness, thus changing their outlook on life, making them better citizens as well as the Society.
716	I believe that sport is an important aspect of education and should be heavily encouraged and should be made an element in PE to all children. Not all should play sports, but the concept of it all be gained and elements developed should be embraced and encouraged.
717	I think education is very important, it will influence their lives to much. I do not think that school should be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often. The next course of action should be good activities for kids, especially boys and girls, to help them be healthier for their futures.
718	PE is always mandatory, we have to start school, parents should start to give kids the free time of play after school until the night, It was very fast children at the first day it was a wonderful experience for kids. The system of the school works well. Now it's too late, parents in the morning to drive a few hundred kilometers to pick up children from school, after a month or two in the afternoon. What could you tell to them, even the teacher could not stand it.
719	In what area you teach PE when the children are not so well? At least a requirements, but not more often. We would give them some good games of physical education activity. Separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.  ### Input: Better nutrition and exercise are keys to an overall healthy lifestyle. With better nutrition comes an opportunity to lead a healthy life. Also with exercise there are the key benefits of health.  ### Response: Better nutrition and exercise are keys to an overall healthy lifestyle. Also with
720	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The UNITED States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works. There is a loving god
721	The only way to maintain freedom for women and men in the United States is to have secular laws passed by each state. There is a loving God, however, and if you believe in him, you should think about that. Secular law is the only law that works. I support equal rights for gay men and women, and do not support gay marriage bans or any other type of discrimination.
722	I believe in marriage equality. I believe that there's only one god, who loves everyone and can't be traced to a religion. I believe that believers and non-believers should be able to marry. I also consider it absurd that religious groups are so obsessed with creating their own unique version of the bible. None of the religions before the bible led to a society of gun-running, uneducated criminals. On the contrary, people of faith lived in harmony and now enjoy their myriad of religious freedom. I agree that the laws for gay marriage can only exist in a secular state.
723	I strongly support gay marriage and other states that have passed such laws. I hate the religious right that seems to be infecting the United States of America. I also believe in secular law, because there is no god. It works. It is the only law that works. There is no love of god. It's a scam. Without the temptation of the law, we would be less selfish. And it would also be the end of wars.
724	Gay marriage bans are a violation of free expression and are in violation of the Constitution because of restrictions placed on marriage. These laws take away from religious freedom and diminish the role of religion in society. In the United States of America, individuals should not be pressured into having religious convictions or beliefs. Secular government is required, and it should be made clear that at any time anyone can defend their religious beliefs.
725	Give peace a chance. We need to respect and encourage other opinions. We need to learn to listen to one another. We need to value the views and ideas of others. In order to do that, we need to give the speech the opportunity to be heard. Liberalism is not a hate speech, just as conservatism is not bashing for freedom of speech. Each believes their views are correct and each supports the freedoms they believe the society should provide.
726	The deal is, Freedom of Speech goes both ways. People not only have a right to say pretty much what they want, other people have a right to object, argue & even ask for an apology. A liberal says something, a conservative objects, and the conservative is bashed for 'violating a person's freedom of speech. A conservative says something, a liberal objects and the conservatives either let it drop there or defend the original statement on it's merit. So who is really against freedom of speech, The conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement?
727	I don't think liberal right and conservative wrong was ever an actual issue. Many people have voted for the liberal party thinking conservatives are a people of bigoted hatred. While the moderates are blaming the liberals for not wanting to focus on the real issues with fear of confrontation. The stakes are so high even conservatives are marginalizing themselves in an effort to minimize the divide, or deflect from the real issues. They are blaming conservatives because they are afraid and hate the fact that the liberal party only has so much power to make change and make them want to drop out and join them. Well, get over your liberal bashing. You are in the minority. They need to live with the fact that one-third of the people will always have no tolerance for liberals, no respect for their views and will vote for them. What did they expect?
728	The liberal whose ideas of every subject should be absolute not open to debate on any point is the greatest threat to true freedom. he always needs to be the big winner and is the real bully. he is the handmaiden of death. he has as his first tool to destroy the first tool. he must always be at the wrong place. he must be stopped at any cost.
729	The deal is: "Freedom of speech goes both ways"  So who is really against freedom of speech?  The conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement. However, a liberal and conservative respect each other & typically always have in the past.
730	Capital punishment is better than state executions, for it allows a more effective, though more violent, death penalty. State execution, however, allows multiple options to less lethal measures. This simple consideration, coupled with the fear of death, decides the balance of effectiveness and morality. In many cases, capital punishment is one of the least effective methods, especially since, rather than uniformly attempting to limit personal options, courts and the public often view it favorably as a guise to justify lower effectiveness, as they deem the death penalty a politically motivated killer of relatively low risk.   The problem is, however, that it is not just effective, but efficient as well. State execution can cost as much as $20,000 per death, while capital punishment would cost much less as a result of a less traumatic death. If multiple non-lethal options were available, as they do in many places, the cost would likely be only as much as $3000 per death.
731	Revolutions are essentially modern day rebellions against the establishment. However, like capital punishment, the two are frowned upon because of their harshness and the potential for unintended consequences. There are other mitigating factors with revolution (like greed) and there are more effective solutions to modern day problems. Furthermore, revolutions do not yield positive societal consequences, they end up causing more harm than good to certain parts of the population. These include both societal and religious splits, the breakdown of the law, chaos, and a breakdown of health care.
732	Capital punishment is a horrific practice. From a religious perspective, a Christian country should ban it. It is morally wrong and effective. Contrary to popular belief, many solutions, though not as effective, are available. These include ransom money, solitary confinement, probationary detention, community service, fines, and blood money. Nonetheless, despite its effectiveness, there are better solutions that should not be a first choice. Fortunately, most government nations do not support capital punishment, but, except in some conservative countries, it should not be the first option.
733	I avoid capital punishment, but not because of the stereotyped beliefs of christian believers. For the most part, I view capital punishment as abhorrent simply because of the way it is in the us. Capital punishment is nothing more than handing out a death sentence to one man for another man in a situation that violates humanity. The group view really matters here more than the individual perspective I had before this discussion. Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it. You'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the US'. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it of course. Apart from that I just see capital punishment as a barbaric act that dehumanises and horrifically destroys the ability of a criminal to live a normal life. It should not be used as an efficient way of policing.
734	"Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it. You'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the USA's. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it of course. ........." Capital punishment is..."   Capital punishment is essentially the best law enforcement out there, by any means. Asses most countries that have used it. You'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the USA's. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it of course."  - wrote Stewart_impliedly:
735	I agree that there are cases where it is appropriate to conduct a systematic investigation but argue that this example is a common one. In order to evaluate the evidence and set the plaintiff's case (that they are actually in default), the debt collectors will need to perform an investigation. They are no good in assuming they know you are in default, as has been documented in court. Unless the individual has been in a chronic, severe financial backwater for the last decade, there is a strong chance that they will either not have any evidence of default, or will have proof of payment of bills and income. There is also a strong likelihood that they will deny the claim anyway and make inflammatory statements to credit reporting agencies.
736	I already received a letter from my creditor encouraging them to discuss my issue with the collector and get an update. \n\  Now the letter contains one reference to another debt collector with their attorney involved in the negotiation. Needless to say, I didn't give any indication of that here (i.e. I didn't say, "Enjoy my Canadian backcountry and successful life there.")  Now the letter contains some information pertaining to customer complaints for the same debt and no indication of whether I can or can't get any resolution at all. The warning seems misguided in that I'd like to stay here with all my ducks in a row.
737	Yes. No warranties are made regarding any future refunding. Strikes early,  but I was thinking, 'I do n't like the way this runs. Why accept one bit of a refund when I can get a second.' None of the above choices . For more on reusitabling a domain name click here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheamion/details/aasbkbnrv (I think) stay in the business
738	Fair Dudes Firm, the accounting firm you hired, is providing excellent customer service.  It has treated me very well all these years. Without prejudice, after we were certified with your company and proudly adopted your letters as ours. we have stated that you owe us money. Now that they intend to shut down our company, we are going to pursue the lawsuit. Because it might open up a new world of legitimacy. the potentiality still exists to collect on the debts.  They have a dumpster full of rejected issues that are well overdue. We might get your own company to pay, or we might take on MONEY as the debt. Now, let's just say that they won't miss any chance to milk that cow. On the other hand, we might consider some of the issues non revenue generating and perhaps would be able to offer some negotations in payment terms with a lot of variations depending on their reaction. Anyway, we have accomplished what was our goal with you, protecting your business and protecting yourself from creditors who have performed very poorly. Good luck and congratulations.
739	By law, the financial institution must immediately put a defendant on notice of the lawsuit. A notice of sufficient urgency should be sent, including the name and address of the plaintiff in question, the facts of the suit, the issues at issue, the amount claimed, as well as the average amount involved in similar cases. The defendant is now provided with three choices:  First, they can take a... Read More about Attorney's Email Setup
740	Freedom is valued. As some people stated here, we are more likely to condemn or suggest breaking laws that we feel we don't respect. Having a debate on capital punishment and abortion and murder isn't a good sign for civil liberties. No one wants abortion, but one should never set a death sentence. The argument that punishment does not protect those who deserve it is true, but should be put to the back burner. Free markets have failed the US, we are the envy of all the peoples around the world. And hats off to everyone who identifies with Christianity.
741	It will make the blood of people unbearable. The supporters of abortion will bring about death. These arguments are opposed by the great majority of people. The supporters of abortion bring death by telling people that abortion makes blood unbearable. Why can't we talk about something that no one knows exactly? Or is it just that supporting abortion and death is the most... [...] He is funny to read when he likes it. But surely someone must believe otherwise. The people who do can speak their minds, which I take to mean the right is not silent and men can exist without being silent either.
742	Getting to know me better? No...Read my comment at this blog: http://debate-central.typepad.com/about_variants/196-drake-history_citation.html And back to your question: Am I anti-abortion?  No. :) I'm not giving any little details, I only outlined that this American anti-abortion icon is an idiot. I mean, any politician, who's just wanted it then ...
743	I will shut my comments down if he does that, then you're the loser. I have no problem with your opinions or beliefs. You should educate yourself more about the real world. And if the reality isn't something you want to hear, it doesn't hurt to start a war. When the plight of immigrants is this miserable, I think the majority wants everyone to be given a second chance with immigration reform, not that the capital-punishers aren't good people.
744	Neither does anyone want the death penalty. As referenced above, I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred. I do not think that the world will change much. There have always been storms and wars, and there always will be, because human nature is flawed and selfish.
745	Its very important to know what you have borrowed, who is owed money to, and whom to sue. It is always best to take a couple extra seconds to ask questions. A few minutes after the phone call I just had, I decided to call the gentleman asking about the card and explained that I didn't agree with what he was telling me. He asked me "why don't you see him"? His tone was arrogant and condescending. I just politely responded "would that be a bad idea?" He sounded disappointed in me and said "I'm not going to blame you if you don't want to see him". I have been dealing with banking institutions and service providers for two decades now and took a different route to get my refund from him.
746	Alternatively, contact the Financial Ombudsman Service. The detail was lacking here but hope this makes sense. This was done for the comfort of potential readers.

747	They can't compensate you because they violated the required procedures when you approved the charge. Throughout this entire process you've been very cooperative. There are some small fees that need to be resolved, but not before one final letter. Otherwise, I'd suggest you ignore them and go with another credit card, particularly if you have good payment history and maintain the minimum payments. If you still need help, mention to your banker or counselor at the Fair Trade Capitalist Community Service Center.
748	I do not make a ton of money from online reviews, but I figured I would try my hand at it. Technically IC Systems is liable, but you'd probably have to go to small claims court to make them cough up.   My advice to you is to change your bank account number right away so they can't dip into it any time they like. (This is the only dependable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you have given your permission for the withdrawal.) Then set up other payment arrangements with them. While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you.
749	Don't trust IC Systems as they will charge you without explanation. Make other arrangements with them. When they do fee abusive, refer to your letter of accounting and the passage. In that instance, you should make a counter statement detailing the fee that is unfair. Then submit a complaint to the Better Business Bureau. Use the following: "I would like to make a complaint regarding the following issue with the Company: I signed a payment agreement, the payment was taken on 3/23/2010, and the application was not added to my account until 5/31/2010. I also received a confirmation from Bill Security from Xerox/Sentalio/iT technologies as I did sign the agreement 3/23/2010 and that I was charged a late fee of $0.35 for my old agreement. I never received an email asking for the agreement to be removed and I never used my account to make any extra charges to my account, such as airline tickets. I sent them a message, asking them to explain the fees, on the 5/31/2010 and received the following reply from James Scan: "I am sorry for any...
750	No not at all. This is one of those times where we absolutely need them. We need to be able to say that "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prision. But if I hate racism and hate the black community  who is going to be around to really hate them back as much as they want to hate. I personally find that racism is absolutely wrong and should be put to the end.
751	Nearly endless. Obviously, when you're every day stuck in traffic and you're angry all the time and losing sleep, it's hard to sleep.   After that, there's labor, bullying, having to climb the corporate ladder, making sure the stores at work aren't closed for too long, and beyond.
752	I not only dislike the authority vested in many organisations, but I truly oppose control and bureaucracy. I will fight to the death to ensure that my contributions are free from bureaucratic waste and self serving administration.
753	I urge that we not only STAND up for the views that we hold most dearly, but also that we act upon those opinions. And a LOT of others don't. As for what we SHOULD care about, that's a different question.
754	I believe that our freedoms are vital to our lives. I oppose the political correctness in the US. I fight to the death to let someone say what he thinks. I can say that I'm against abortion because I don't think people should be able to just replace babies as they please.
755	Hi, this is Dr. Suarez. The child has been found to be carrying small amounts of designer drugs and a 3rd drug of abuse. His case is being put before the judge as a form of documentation to testify before a grand jury. The child is younger than 12, as per the law. The judge recommended that the child not be asked to testify. Sorry for any confusion. I am sending you this email for your records.
756	Provide the appropriate information. In the event that this juvenile does have a mental disorder, inform the children, or any of the other community members, at the child care center, through the community meetings, and according to the rules and regulations. The young man has a pending charge regarding committing trespassing and battery. He has not been convicted. It is true that it might be difficult to inform the authorities, but due to the law, the juvenile and his family still have the ability to seek the help they need at any time.
757	Take my son to a firehouse. Stay out of this building. If the community center decided to miss us the next week, go to another community center or you could go to a firehouse. Please leave my son alone. I just want my son to be happy. The state is taking over my son. Since the state is taking over my son, there is no reason why I can't take my son anywhere, period.
758	Yes, this would be the case for many states. Medications can be controlled by law in some states. In Arizona, for example, meds are controlled within 30 days. If a baby is born out of wedlock, the father is required to notify the mother of the child's condition. Right to life laws exist in states that have life without parole. While incarcerated, you should provide all of the necessary medical information for your incarcerated child, including any allergies.
759	Since I feel that you are entitled to your privacy, I feel that I can not give you information other than what your child is being prescribed. However, since the child is a minor and therefore legally disqualified from being around children under the age of 21, I will recommend that you take your child to a hospital instead of your local children’s hospital for health reasons.
760	I propose writing a new statement that provides further instructions in doing so and explain that law enforcement has a variety of document recovery schemes, such as the First In Time Act (FITA).
761	In some ways, good lawyers have a moral responsibility to recognize when people need to get them help with legal issues. Your message isn't just about money. As someone who has represented clients with the exact same situation as yours, I want to take a moment to highlight the fact that anyone involved should seek advice. I know you are considering taking out more money from your account to cover some costs, but don't do that. The documentation you are holding in your name (deposits, banks statements, mortgage, energy payments etc. is of the utmost importance and you should be happy to see someone after a period of years to discuss their past actions with them. And even though you don't want to assume any responsibility
762	If anyone got involved with these financial records, they were responsible for any legal actions. To start with this document is already in her name so if she has attempted to claim before or not she should be held to that responsibility but in the absence of prior attempts she does not have to be held accountable.
763	If daughter was 19, and competent at the time, then all records are hers, nobody elses. Depending on how much time has passed the document holders could be charged with theft. If years have passed, and the daughter hasn't made previous attempts to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders documents. You need a lawyer involved.
764	If daughter was 19 and competent at the time, then the documents should remain in her. The documents may be returned only when the daughter proves that the man signed them for her.
765	All of us Americans should realize that if the State allowed laws to be passed for any reason without the consent of both Houses of Congress, and then of the people, then we would be too poor and our children would be strangers in their own country, then we would be oppressed. The only way out is to start the fight, the start the war. It is better to start a war, and leave the State with all its money to control, than it is to
766	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. I say that people should believe in the government for several reasons. The government is acting with the best intentions and brings the fight against terrorism, in the same way the government acted against the Velvet Revolution which brought peace and security. They are well meaning and want the best for the country. They believe that they are getting ahead of that curve of terrorism, and they are doing the best they can. They want to go after terrorists that intend to hurt innocent people. They want to stop terrorists that ...
767	That the government is innocent and cannot be judged without first establishing a convincing case. The people who are at least partly guilty and thus cannot be judged are all bound to one rule: they are the government. The ruling of the government does not mean that the people are guilty. They are already thoroughly scrutinized. The government does not work at the cost of justice, but on the contrary, it works at the cost of weakening the rule of law.
768	To be fair, and have faith in our government or not does not determine our fate. Our fates should not be given any more weight than they are. In my opinion, those who say that there are no Christians in a concentration camp, or that they don't put their faith in a government that murders them, are simply not thinking things through. Just because you have faith in a government, does not make you immune to a certain tragedy, however bad it may be.
769	Is God, we were created by God, who God, who ordered everything, who gave us every tool and skill that man needed to keep himself alive on this planet, who gave us time and space to do everything our wonderful brains ever dreamed up, did? Why could he but again somehow choose to use his perfectly good children to conquer the other species, using drugs and poison?
770	I'm currently working on my first business plan, which will eventually open up some sort of makeup/nail business. It will specialize in Asian-inspired nail art. The closest thing I have, right now, is an in-person hairstylist shop in someone I work for at the... How can I know if someone was fired "unlawfully", they should call an attorney to advice you. Google "Jane Doe, Employment Discrimination, Unfair Dismissal" and you may find some results in common.
771	Hello, I've watched video's about unemployment and savings vs wage earning. I can not do that in Texas because it's illegal. Also, we like our way of life and our employees. So, no job changes will happen. Thanks for watching and I look forward to your response. Please mail me to Where can I find unappointing offices??? When can I see a lawyer??? I'd rather not answer that question..... unethically emails that are directly automated!!! unethically emails that are directly automated!!!
772	Fair business people. Employees or employees should not be entitled to the equal protection under law granted by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Discrimination means treating someone unfairly and you are discriminated against when you feel discriminated against because of the way you are treated. If you think you are being discriminated against in your workplace, you can request an attorney at your local bar association for a referral to an employment attorney or you can contact an employment lawyer directly to review the circumstances.
773	Goods and services supplied by an employee are inalienable. While an employer may reasonably terminate an employee for any reason, typically employees are provided a "pink slip" and these terms and conditions are described in the employee handbook of the employee. An employee cannot be fired for the reason of excessive absenteeism. Most employers do not fire an employee on the basis of race, gender, age, disability or other factors.  This type of firing is known as "discrimination." Employees should not have to prove themselves to an employer.
774	It is unfair to fire someone without reason, when the firing was made because the individual member of a protected class. Contact an attorney to see if you have a discrimination claim. If there is a legal claim, you can receive compensation for unpaid wages, lawsuit costs, or both. You can also seek representation from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC), an agency of the U.S. government that may help you with unpaid wages. Disaster aid would be available depending on your state.
775	I value individual character over group identity, but I don't hate it. Based on these views, I agree that groyte fighters, when fed a liberal diet, many including gay rights activists, will not want me to be president. Except that I am aware that the last leader we have had, Reagan, was generally considered "fundamentalist".
776	I agree with the author 100%. I don't believe "god" because i dont know him. god is a figure of speech based on the religious. all of us have the same computer and something called brain cells. god is just a statement that is being made by supporters of their religious beliefs. This method or belief was effective at the time it was used, but maybe it is just a fraud from the religious organizations that make millions a year (depending on their beliefs).
777	I prefer the later, reasonable answer: ALL RISE! I think that there are no systems that do not contain flaws!  For example, how can you believe that "thieves and murderers" have been protected from illegal actions for millions of years of creation? What can God do about it: or how can he work within such a system?!!! IMHO, crime is rewarded, apparently, and people in power exploit the systems to help themselves - so even if someone does good deeds, the system is messed up.  Many over the centuries have thought of a system which aims to protect the masses and to restrict illegal actions.  But that did not stop crime, to the contrary, it increased - with the lack of intentions of a real system!!! And after the messed up "Roman Republic" and the new ones which followed, the economic crisis appeared - no wonder, it's so important to control and to be controlled by others!!! It is a great tragedy, that such a huge step could be...
778	I like very much the way you started: ALL RISE! I do not support "god", very well, and i do not believe that we can trust "johnny hands". I consider a socialist state a violation of natural rights and a paralyzing inaction in reducing the suffering in the world. Similarly, i do not support communist rule as well. When you suggest "johnny hands", I do not see how this is different from the "johnny hands" when Ghandi "unjustly" threatened British rule, in the early 19th century.  Other than that, i strongly support libertarianism and i hate what critics of it who try to attack that when they themselves commit crimes against their conscience-defying: for example, i strongly support the right to bear arms in the home to protect property, the right of people to travel a [non-responsible]...
779	Thank you for sending it! On the first side, I cannot disagree that the legal system is not perfect. This is also the case with most things. But I am glad to see that you think I can disagree with god even today. I agree with you about the attacks on israel and christianity. At the same time, you can only think about it through your individual perspective and there is no one who can tell you how to feel about it in a precise and definitive way. But, there is one major problem in our world nowadays: the people who are ignorant are not educated or, more to the point, they are smarter than the educated ones who usually try to fool the ignorant. I think that in the future the world is going to become a war zone in the schools and in the marketplaces. Maybe the way to end the state of affairs is to open a school where everyone can read and write freely.
780	Hope to see yousomewhere>> Dunkin to the PM if u cant believe i am here. i don't take drugs the only thing i have ever used in my life. i have a three month old daughter i was using drugs but i quit. yesterday i saw my girl she was so beautiful. she has n't spoke to me in 10 months but i need to know why is she not here with me with my daughter we have never had problems. she was just doing fine until yesterday. am
781	Alright his parents are going to support him whenever he needs something, and as far as who he says he is not in trouble because he can apply for legal help if he wants to. Definitely he's ok with me being there whenever he needs to be but he's not a violent individual, or committing any crime.
782	yeah..guys get us the bail money..the bail is not issued until they get no call of attorney for 9 hours...oh by the way at least he won;t be able to drive anymore till he passes the learner pilot 's test....yeah but he is already 15 and has been driving for three months already...thank god it wasn't his first time...they had some...
783	Anyway thanks for the advice, not too bad for after detention...can always buy new pencils. Stop by next year if you wish and I will be your uncle! Oh my those were the teachers rules not mine..anyway they were ok and i have one more question that might be a little dumb...im 14 years old  i have heard that you have to get your parents permission to get a girls number...so does that mean if i know that she is not my cousin  i can still get her number ?
784	One should not use capitalism to justify violence. Capitalism was intended to bring about wealth, not to see the great divide created between those with and without wealth. In another time, another place, you were not allowed to own slaves, but we just kept doing it until it became unethical. This is not a discussion for any topics that are of interest to this audience.
785	My friends and I are intrigued by the military. We see that men are dedicated to our country. It makes us, as college students, feel proud to be military leaders and to be part of our communities. It is a part of our lives. However, the military system is at odds with our beliefs in freedom and individual rights as embodied in our Constitution. I am vehemently opposed to compulsory military training for first responders, whether emergency, police, fire, or EMT.  I don't think that the military is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, but I don't believe that the military punishes individuals who do wrong, especially those who are active duty members, but it is a paper tiger. I think the military is treated better than the average citizen and has issues which don't make news, such as harassment and teasing by fellow members. The military is also notorious for its sexual harassment problem.    ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: The government shutdown happened without warning. I know that in the United States the government works with a series of shifts, shifting and rolling over projects that are never finished. The transition from Trump to Biden is a much needed...
786	I don't agree with the military and I think the majority of the military is just idiots and lackeys of corporate greed. I support fair trade and private trade and market economics. I also support teamwork, and I'm here to help you guys become better people, not invading your country for your own reasons, even though it is the only country in the world that has borders you guys don't want.
787	I question the patriotism of my community due to their views on religion and military service. I do not consider the military service to be anything other than pointless conflict. I believe that people should instead focus on the negative benefits that arise from war and campaigning, such as a higher chance of radicalization and death. I also believe that members of the military who do some meaningful work for the benefit of those around them would be preferred.
788	I think it is fair that the military is paid a decent amount of money. I believe, in my opinion, that soldiers get to die in war in defense of the country. However, for many that defense is not an actual part of the job. In my opinion, our military should not be so strong it has a negative effect on our economy and lifestyle. Rather, the military should support a country that has declined and fought a war once or twice, rather than routinely fight abroad. I would prefer that our money be spent on education rather than military spending, which also plays a bigger role in our economy. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with having a large military.
789	This is a conflict between American ideals and military ideals. This was a very different country when you went to college and if you are working as an engineer or a software analyst, being in the military may be more promising that being on Wall Street. I see this the most likely to emerge out of the election. It may seem sensational, but it seems that the only way military's can regain the respect that they lost to the public, is for them to establish more of an academic atmosphere. It is...
790	Today's technology, credit cards, debit cards, and online banking all eliminate the need for paper checks when transferring money from one account to another. Today's technology has made life easier and faster. Advances in technology have also impacted the professional world, especially doctors, not only in the field of diagnosis, but also as a means of payment through various digital formats.
791	Direct deposit makes paying payroll more efficient since money transfers without encountering human error or paper checks. It also eliminates the possibility of fraud.I am strongly against the paper checks because they pose a risk to credit card companies and the general public, just as they pose a risk to taxpayers who receive checks (since checks are based on the balance of the taxpayers' account and can be forfeited or refused to be cashed in a number of cases), unnecessarily. The use of checks also gives unfair priority to taxpayers who receive bank deposits and cash transfers (where they can transfer their money into a tax-deferred account), while limiting payments to specific recipients. But modern technology has significantly reduced the need for traditional checks, so I consider it a waste of resources, waste of space, and waste of money to assume that older people will still use them even though they have no reason to. The state could stop discriminating against electronic payment or provide a tax break for people who do not receive checks.
792	The need for paper checks has died out.  So why not go the electronic route. Online banks, debit cards and credit cards are very convenient methods. I feel a barrier to full compliance exists. Open bank account, get credit card and start using it to pay in convenience stores and shops and use it to pay for day to day necessities. No need to do any paper checks ever again.
793	Direct deposit is better for both employers and employees because it eliminates the inconvenience of having to print and mail checks to employees. Thus, the only people who seem to still use paper checks are older people, who seem to not have a problem with paper checks and have no reason to adapt, even though it causes an inconvenience to people waiting in line behind them.
794	Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish
795	I do not think Nascar should be considered a sport. On one hand, it doesn't capture the true spirit of the sport. As people are now so focused on innovation and speed, being second-rate about anything that isn't fast is the new greatness. The second thing is that I'm a betting enthusiast, and many of the drivers in Nascar give me a queasy feeling.
796	I strongly disagree with the statement that Nascar is a sport. First, Nascar is about as entertaining as watching people drive on the highway in circles. The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure, their bodies can endure. So why doesn't anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
797	I have a great deal of respect for all who drive cars. They put up with some remarkable physical limits to maintain a legal life. Considered by most drivers as a safer way to move than walking, the specific limits of various racing speeds and a sport called Nascar are, in my opinion, the stuff of kid's dreams.
798	In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody who can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining. I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure their bodies can endure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
799	I'll save the carbs. I don't play Nascar. There are better things to do in life, such as baseball, basketball, and watching the seasons pass. I think baseball is a great sport. I love the sport but there are also far better things to do in life.
800	I believe that all animals, whether domesticated, feral or wild should be free. Personally, I do not support the caging of animals behind bars. In my opinion, animals are equal to humans in value and should not be of any lesser status than man.
801	There really is a fine line between someone who wants the animals to be free, and someone who wants to caged animals to be enjoyed by people. My own personal convictions would never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars, for the amusement of people. That animal can't speak for itself and it sure as fuck doesn't deserve to suffer being kept in some zoo where you can come on your own or with friends and kick it around and that sort of thing. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people, because for the most part animals are viewed as inferior, which then justifies locking them up. F**k zoos.
802	Totally not. Only people who are mentally disturbed would support caging animals up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people. V
803	All animals are free but it doesn't mean they should never be locked in. It does mean that they should be treated with dignity. An animal's life is less valuable than that of a fish, a dog, a cat, or a human?
804	Support cage free zones to protect the caged animals and stop the slaughter and trafficking of them. I would be supportive of such a drive. There is not much that can be done at the moment.
805	Finally, enjoy your interview. you live in the comments and rageing, but see how bucky hates mma, and clearly states he hates ufc, but naturally likes praise. don't not be a jerk, does not mean he deserves it, has his own life, and his own ideas about mma. i mean, he has made statements about defending bucky and hate on UFC. I don't mind them as a fighter, and in fact, it makes my day to see fans and viewers hate on UFC as well as bucky, though sometimes, he/she doesn't deserve it.I used to live in the United States and was in college for about 5 years at Mount Washington before moving to Europe, so I would rather spend time here taking video. if you want to talk, i'm on youtube chatroom as kickbaotch. if you want me to talk more, give a direct message to me on twitter, just use my nick name on twitter "inkname
806	Sno comment since u can probably answer, suck it up ok ufc lives in real life(not austin nor brooklyn) and that has something to do with it...ufc is most likely a fucktard. onto the points, ufc has more talent of fighters than pride has. i would pick anywhere else except us so just settle with what you have, as of now ufc sucks balls
807	I like ufc, but i also support pride. ufc fighters need to move around more and not just to the north american part of the world. claiming their fans are only north american is just disgusting, as if they live in their own world. people like to live in their own mindset instead of reality, after all what are they supposed to know of something without being outspoken on it?
808	I don't think ufc should have removed anyone who was within the rules. its got every kind of cup, making ufc such a panoraimous orgionation where many of the raw talent are left hanging. as of now it's a big ratings vacuum. ufc took the best fighters out of the Pride era, yet the biggest draw were the Crocop/Rampage era fighters, who sell better records. Why ufc needs to kill so many of them? That's nonsense.
809	the answer is pride because ufc doesn't bring its fighters from all over the world, rather most of the ones it has are from their end of the league. ufc was a niche group of fighters first and foremost. ufc should keep it that way.
810	I play guitar. I think I actually do the most of the tops. The more I'm in a band and play in public, the more I love it. It really helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed. I enjoy rock music and guitar.
811	I play guitar and I think I enjoy doing it and having people compliment me on it. Guitar Hero helps us get strength and speed, dexterity and coordination, and even as a hobby, one can develop a heightened sense of awe around the instrument. I like rhythms and how the combos and solos work. I also find the experience of building and fabricating my own instrument to be an amazing one. P.S. No, I don't think he just missedpelled, but if someone suggested he do it this way that is the way it will look on the screen. You get the idea?
812	I play guitar and don't feel like I'm ruining it. I actually think it helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed. I'm sure people think I'm a flaming douchebag for thinking so. Either way, I love guitar heroes and reading Erich von Däniken. Both. I love being able to express myself with music and reading about the science of the universe.
813	I love guitar hero and agree with its premise. However I disagree with not only the name of the debate but the whole point of the discussion, which is that guitar is about playing it, not being in a band and being a leech off of other people's musicianship.
814	I play guitar and no I am not a loser, I have a flair for music. It helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed. However, I have heard complaints about the fact that this line of talented men feel that they are discriminated against. I feel that musician should be judged not by who he is but by how good he is and how he excels in his field.
815	Obviously, gay women are discriminated against less than gay men because of men being inferior and less masculine. Therefore, homophobic men are right that gay women are better off. As for homophobic women, perhaps they are becoming increasingly aware that women's association with sex is often viewed negatively, and therefore are starting to accept women's sexuality and investigate it as such. Just be sure to understand what you are supposed to think of the gender-based classification itself.
816	All men should stick to their own attitudes, believe in their own males and keep their individuality. Everyone has a little gay gene inside them, although when you see a straight man wearing pink while he's not attracted to girls, it makes it hard to judge the person.  Gay men are a natural progression into humanity, with the very thing these words attempt to deny: freedom. Therefore, I do not think that gay men should be discriminated against. Although, it does hurt the community at times, I think that's okay. I understand that not everyone feels the same way.
817	One of the misconceptions of the times is that lesbians are more sex positive because there are not lesbians in the picture to ruin their sexiness. That may be true if there were large segments of the population like that, but it is not the case. Lots of lesbians have boyfriends, and they make very much of them (particularly in the popular media.) It's not just the popular media, as queer women are discriminated against as well, and have "less honor" as gay men do: the general purpose of romantic relationships is for women (implying that a man's romantic interest in a woman is considered a fluke, unworthy of attention). So as far as societal acceptance goes, lesbians tend to be more aggressive and rebellious; gay men are often more passive.
818	Men's and women's identities tend to intersect, and thus in a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular. However, there are a few reasons why I view lesbian sexualities to be downright sexy: the first is that a man is never involved in this dynamic; second, men would be much less likely to view this behavior as sexual; and third, men would also be less likely to see it as "abnormal." Gay women are, on the other hand, faced with many stereotypes, like not being sexually active or having different advantages. I believe lesbian sexualities are generally more social than traditional, due to being less regarding to gender pride or honor. The reason why I am not all that fond of gay men's interactions is because being seen romantically as inferior to men then results in all of their actions being seen as little else but sexual.
819	LGBTQI+ people and other community members may be gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, asexual, or questioning. There are many LGBTQI+ dating websites that can help them connect with other community members, and the law prohibits discrimination against them. I think homosexuality is maladaptive and an unnatural situation, and I applaud people who do not accept homosexuality as their own identity (which makes them superior).
820	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy so we assumed that was because of that. The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean but the food was very average. The food quality was not what I was expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.
821	The food was pretty average in the buffet. The bar and casino were much nicer than the buffet. On our last visit to Vegas we had much better food at one of the casinos. If you can afford to pay top dollar, then the buffet may be nice. However if you are a couple, in my opinion, the buffet won't be very satisfying because the food wasn't spectacular. As a couple, we have better luck with other casino casinos. If you eat at casinos you might want to try the Arby's if you are young, a McDonald's if you are elderly, or mom & pop chain restaurants like pizza hut if you are anywhere in the middle.
822	Many people don't listen to the warning signs of illness. They don't see the decline in their mental and physical abilities because they think they can fix anything. Hopefully some people will take more seriously the warnings. The buffet after a show in Las Vegas was not that good. Next time we go to Vegas, we will try another buffet.
823	I did not like the buffet. We expected more from our visit, at $70+. The food quality was below average, as were the service by the employees and lack of attentiveness. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.
824	The hostess was definitely rude and the food was very mediocre. The hostess would put a huge selection of dishes in the buffet and then charge a $70+ per person. We didn't realize our mistake. Next time we are in Vegas we will try other places.
825	Shame on you, but outside there is the real world
826	Because I want my friends and people I know to dress how I dress and that if you wear a top that color you have to wear shorts that color. i also want to change the way people dress too. I don't think people should
827	Everyone is entitled to what they want, but not for that reason.
828	Because your own education is funded through the taxes of those who do not have it. Your fundamentalist beliefs are a waste of time and energy.
829	because you want to accept me for who i am and, well i want to accept you for who you are and what makes you unique.
830	FAIR TRADE IS AN ESSENTIAL THOUGHT FOR OUR TIME. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH YOU WILL BENEFIT EVERY TIME YOU GO SHOPPING AT A fair trade store, not only for the money you save, but also the improved standard of life in these poor countries who don't have the source control to produce the goods you don't even know exists. STOP FINDING CONVENIENCES IN THE DEFECTS OF OTHER'S LABOR. I am more than happy to go and spend some extra time traveling or shopping to support fair trade, especially when you go to a Florida store and realize that you are paying $3
831	Mr. Feedback, welcome to the site!  We truly appreciate your kind words. As you can imagine, Apple and other major web companies are very good friends at this point. That being said, IE is getting faster and faster every year and that’s not because we’re trying to lower standards on IE; there is no need.
832	All this misdirection about hawt backstabber. Oh wait. Whats more disastrous for users (including the ethic core, FUD) than i havent said
833	Yes, I've been using Mozilla products for quite some time, including last year's Thunderbird. I love the interface of it and all of the "useful" features it has. Since IE misses quite a few standards, it's been a rather frustrating experience. I will not recommend IE to anyone again until they can fix all of the stumbling blocks they put in the way of IE 7's success.
834	I think Apple is probably one of the greatest companies in the world, along with any number of other successful small businesses, but I'm not interested in what any of them have to do with the browser wars. I've always made a point of telling people that Microsoft is not just "some company selling software", but rather a group of right wing monopolists who make their real money killing people and keeping the system from working as it should.
835	In the evening on Sunday or sometimes on Sunday afternoon, we'd go out to eat together. We shared a bottle of wine and generally had a good time together, entertained, and other than that, spent time in a relaxing, intimate environment. I would never, ever hurt her.
836	If my wife confided in me and then she passed away without telling me that she had a terminal disease, and she wasn't conscious of how much she had in her insurance how much would I have been angered. I would have called her out on it because if she knew how much she had I don't think she would have left me that early. But I would still be an honourable man.
837	I would be highly angry with my wife for me not giving her the support and help she needed. I would be married to someone else if I didn't agree to take care of my responsibilities. I think this is true for most of us, especially men.
838	If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on the type of murder whether it be self defence or just like a joke.
839	I would not die without a fight and I would not betray her trust. If that were to occur, I would be very upset. I would hate myself for it and I would not go to bed at night.
840	Because americans are ego it dont make sense for u to lead the world if u got self esteem then u sure u could if u self confident and self respect thats when u would lead this world because u had earnd that right not some idiot
841	Over the centuries, the blue and the white country has been the progressive country in the world. They've pushed for democracy around the world. Now they'll say "turn the other cheek and you will know what is forged in the fire." This country was the first in the world to ban any form of sex education and discipline of children, it had
842	The EU is a good thing. We live better thanks to western economies and international trade than we would have to. The EU war is the good thing. The good president Obama is. Funny that they are the ones who decide what is right and wrong to us when they themselves are only the heads of nation. When 1 per ceives something that is the
843	I have no opinion to give, this was beyond dumb. open bank rates free movement of people open borders open borders until its worthless public education is the best way to waste money, is it simply a waste of money with no results
844	You are not even responding to the request write a comment about what you think so its at least on the site
845	Having a father is not as bad as fatherless because at least he lives. I am not ready to go Fatherless. I would rather him be in and out of my life than never existed. I don't know him at all. I don't even know what his likes and dislikes are, and he knows nothing about me.
846	I am male and believe that I am a unique person, with my own individuality, personality, and strengths that I possess and that I was created that way. I am a father, and have lost a wonderful father. Having lost my father, I rely on my faith, which says that I can never know what a father is like, but I can know that a good father is not what some would make it out to be. I embrace my identity, traits, and strengths. I am not at all concerned with having a fatherless life, and could enjoy that without having the option to abandon who I am. I am an atheist.
847	Being fatherless would be miserable because I know no one besides a satanic cult that serves no purpose. I would rather be suicidal. I would rather die than have a fatherless life. And having a father who would not do anything for you would be worse than having no father at all because instead of having him to care for you, you would have nobody.
848	I believe that being fatherless would be better than having a father who did not care about me. I would rather not have a father than to be misled and doubted by my own father. I strongly believe that families should focus on relationship over achievement, that we must encourage and focus on individuality, and to make sacrifices together for the benefit of the family.
849	Having a fatherless child means that you will see no heartache from him at all. This is especially true if the father is a total idiot. For this reason, I am glad that I never had any father. There would be no hope or achievement, and I would like to think that at least I did not suffer that way.
850	I would be okay with a fatherless childhood because I think it would be okay if it was my mom raising me. I have a mom now and my mom is great to me and it really wouldn't be the end of the world. She would be right with me about this but if it was only my mom I'd be upset but not if the reason it was happening was that my dad was awful at being a father. My mom still loves me though even if I do get upset and if my dad is really bad with me.
851	I hate that they tried to throw out the word father when they created the sex slaves laws. At the time he should have said all men can have a father. If he was alive, I bet that he'd be letting people have a second set of parents in the States. Also, he would be glad that people are starting to have more freedom to pick their own fathers.
852	I do not know. I never have been close with my mom and really only have heard about her from my dad. I hate not knowing who my father is. I think it would be a pain to know. I think you could get one if you're good and good friends with your mom. My dad is a head case for sure, he kind of look back and he wants to write me a letter and I really...
853	I would have to agree with much of what was mentioned in the reply to the first entry. I feel that I would have a better understanding of being raised by two people than I would of being raised by just one. I would also feel a sense of security, rather than feeling abandoned. One parent is better than none at all, even if you have to talk to your mom some, if you want to talk to your dad some day.  Paul Harris
854	Fatherhood is very important, regardless of a grand dad. I think he would want to know who I was growing up. I care deeply about my mother. It would hurt me greatly if she were not by my side at that time. I could have wanted my mom to care for me and not knowing who I am would have been very difficult and sad.
855	Speaking for myself. I don't feel that India is likely to become a global superpower.
856	The USA is another country in my personal list of countries to keep an eye on for superpower status in the next two centuries.
857	I am pessimistic of the rise of India to world power status. What is hindering this rise? The country is basically peasant, and has only recently become self-governing. More guns and boys in uniforms are not going to change the way the country views social issues, particularly those of women and gays, and social and cultural change takes a long time.
858	I think I'm going to vote for a republican. Jimmy Carter was pretty good. So was Reagan. President Bush? He was cool but not inspiring.
859	I strongly think India will surpass the United States as the world's economic and military power before the end of this century.
860	I believe that people find particular faith in many different things, the great majority of which are either little more than superstitions or absolute metaphysical nonsense. God is, of course, a serious question; however, there are no valid proofs for the existence of god
861	God is a mystery. There is no proof that he exists. Although some believers claim there is.
862	Because my father is not Christian, I consider myself an atheist.
863	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of God, there would be no valid proof that that god is Christian or not. There would be no reasons to believe it anyway, because everybody knows that there is no evidence for the existence of God.
864	I honestly do not believe in god, even if that might exist.
865	Humans have been raised in society for many years without the strong eugenic tendency that seemed to exist when I first started growing up. There is also a noted trend of poor socialization, which has been the result of mass media failing to teach the skills necessary to truly function in the modern world. As for the spanking trend, it seems to have become legal, more widespread, and accepted. If this trend continues, it will only come into force when it reaches an extreme level that becomes accepted as a social norm.
866	I'm all for a brutal (or more stringent or more humane) ending. I grew up in the LA-NY area and a little south too. We pretty much only saw spanking as a tool used for discipline purposes. The thin under layer of humane discipline is rapidly eroding. Do you know anyone who used to be in trouble and got their butt spanked and didn't turn into a thug? I mean seriously, everybody knows kids who get spanked by families (neither adults or kids) end up being way more violent and abusive and all the
867	Humans have been raised with increasingly relaxed attitudes towards spanking. Today's children are the most free from discipline there are. They come to the world with a slight topline, an overabundance of time and money, along with...
868	Judging from my childhood, kids today use quite a bit less slapping and spanking...they give full custody of their toys to their siblings as well as to their grandparents...they learn respect from their elders...think about it when you get old...we never did when we were growing up as kid....we were obsessed with fighting and yelling and staying mad...but we're mature now and we can accept things that we used to hate (keeping in mind our wrong moves)........
869	The human race is becoming more and more regressive. Having video games instead of playing out in the street. Skinny dipping instead of just taking a shower. Lobbying instead of setting the example. Excessive amounts of technology, now that's regressive!   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.
870	Lots of my gay friends are my friends and they do not affect my confidence in myself or my abilities. Aside from being gay or straight I am a person of integrity. Certain things can make some people unhappy. People do not have to defend their sexuality or beliefs against societal pressures. As long as they are happy and caring, they should be treated the same as everyone else.
871	I think that being gay is awesome and I have a lot of gay friends. I think that the people should be taken seriously and stop being against it. I can really see how gay people feel. People look at them and they think they are being watched and the people feel that way. We are all human.
872	I have lots of gay friends. I've seen how gay people feel when their loved ones look at them and think they're being watched. People should stop being so against it. We all are human.
873	Lots of gay friends for me I feel great about it. I don't think it's about being straight or gay because there is no such thing as being completely straight. People just open up. And that is the whole point of socializing. It makes us great human beings.  ### Input: I am an American muslim. I believe in Islam and I want to be more of an active muslim. I wish I could go to the mosque, because I really want to make some sort of good contribution to the community where I live. But I am afraid of being ostracized as a muslim. You guys seem to think that muslims are always in the corner looking for the spotlight
874	I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it! People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
875	The world's population is starting to grow. There are millions of people on the street who are hungry and in need of food. Many families are trying to make ends meet with everyone talking about the value of time. Some are trying to advance their careers while others are simply bored. Life is short and should be spent with family and with lots of pride in who we are and where we come from. Everyone has a right to be happy. There are many people who love their spouses, and have kids, and make happy families just as I had.
876	I am gay and I love my husband. I have had a close relationship with my husband for eight years. We have two children, one is gay and another is straight. We have had a good relationship with both of them. Our children are very happy with their choices. They are adults now.
877	I am gay. I feel like I have every right to be around my best friends no matter what. They should be able to marry the person they love but that's my opinion. I am not trying to feel better about who I am. I am just saying that they should be able to get married
878	I am gay and I am a straight married man, who enjoys gay friendships as well as straight ones. My view of the Christian Faith is based on the bible, which we constantly read and discuss. I like literature, sports, and hobbies as well as use my free time to get outside and exercise.
879	I believe that gay people have the right to be happy and that it does not matter that they are gay, as long as they are happy. I find myself happy every day if I have a best friend close by. No one has to be what they are not and homosexuality should be accepted just like everyone else should have the right to be happy.
880	I believe personal growth is crucial to being a good person and society. We can't just pursue common good without helping yourself as well. I am making good on a word that used to stand for better off in the financial but its about being better off in life.
881	I think that personal pursuit is the only way to improve your chances of improving this world. A person can only reach common good, if they themselves have begun to understand what is possible for them and pushed themselves past their limits. The benefits are far greater than what personal self-interestedness will produce, over time.
882	I believe that personal pursuits are better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.
883	As someone who values individual character above group identity and founds hope in the bible, I agree with generalisation as a means of positive social change and improvement. Also, after reading Silent Running, I am concerned about the stance that religion should be shoved down everyone's throat. While religion plays a vital role in society, in my opinion religion should not be an impediment to freedom of
884	My opinion is that personal growth, if done properly is better than a common good. Of course common good is good, but unless all those who benefit are self-empowered, it is only worthwhile if it has been produced for a communal good. Whether or not its worthwhile for a group, is up to all involved. It may not be as useful, but makes for interesting debate.
885	You should believe that one should live by character, and not laws. Laws are created by men, but men should live by character and morals. The second amendment is not about protecting hunting rights - it was in place for a reason. When you go to a gun show to see what they sell and try to convince the criminal in your head that more guns, more weapons = more protection, you better start telling your mom about what you're reading.
886	Just because you are a liberal doesn't mean you are not qualified to live with your families, raise your children, build a home, educate your children. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...The liberal government is full of showboats, who are willing to pass legislation like Hunting Rifle Protection Act while allowing criminals to run wild. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...Thats just liberal ignorance.
887	It is a liberal (= left wing) manufactured mystery that we need to arm ourselves. Armed citizens actually lower crime rates! Moving on to the holocaust. This is mostly an anecdotal point. The holocaust is historically documented and lost. Where are the well documented references to Hitler's "racial purity" policy, policies like Hitler killed off indigenous peoples by orders, and policies like Hitler dreamed of an empire ... a better world according to how the truly great were. And that is your belief system that states that the Germans were superior to the Boers ... etc.
888	Mark Zuckerberg prefers to say that the difference between him and all the other people in the world is he is "code savvy." When he says they don't like him he has to really think for himself because he is that intelligent. Why in the world would he "thing" there was a fire out front and needed his fire extinguisher, but not his handgun? That is an amazing approach, but then again it is in the bible..."Untily the one who finds nothing to condemn will justify his sin."
889	If you couldn't show actual evidence that hardworking people that are not criminals really do worry about their own lives, then you shouldn't even try to say otherwise. Over killing in a small society will never change anything. In fact the normal activity is the problem. Social problems are probably exacerbated by "massive incarceration" like public schools and prisons. The mass incarceration, coupled with the alternative of walking into work armed with deadly machine guns or radios, should be the whole reason for this country to consider going all out to stop the violence. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...It's just "feel good" legislation. Makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant)
890	I'd legalize pot, if it were legal where I grew up. But I think the system we have today has been doing too much to it and is holding it back. People are getting caught up in a web of ills and losing their skills. I believe the system would keep the... - The government is worse. They are selling airplanes that use frozen oxygen to fly, and they are allowing workers to poison their workers with workplace exposure to hazardous materials like mercury. They are allowing dirty junk food in schools and restaurants for the public, and our politicians want to protect bigger businesses at the expense of small businesses. I think that the government is a mafia, just like we have in our world. They are only good for "dirty work." It is too little crime and too much he10...
891	It would be illegal. You'd have to be 21 to buy the drugs. Driving while intoxicated would still be illegal. Employers would still have the right to fire you for stoning on the job, like they already can for being drunk on the job. Employers would still have the right to test you for drugs during the hiring process. The SGA would be illegal as it already is, no matter what legislation the feds push through. The largest cause for those contracts is the failure to get the budget established prior to a referendum. Pay, benefits, tenure and promotion/disposal are never subject to public discussion.
892	Yes, it should be legal. Currently the prisons are overcrowded. People are sent there for possession, and it's cost a lot of money. Employers can fire you for being stoned at work, just like they can for being drunk at work. You need to be 21 to buy marijuana. However, driving while intoxicated will still be considered drunk. A previous poster said it's okay to have one drink and one joint. The laws say nothing about how much you consume, but how intoxicated you are. Employers can fire you for being stoned at work like they can for being drunk at work.
893	Yes it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. Don't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while there. They can regulate it and tax the hell out of it. Think of all the money the government would collect, not to mention how much they would save from the so called "war on drugs" (which they are losing).
894	I think it should be legal, if you can prove you are 21. If the law says you need to prove you are 21, then how is it that you are allowing the sale of it? If you could test it, and they got the dope, it would be legal. Employers should be able to fire someone for being stoned, or something. The owners of the tattoo parlor could also go to jail for being negligent. I think the other argument was to bad and is therefore unnecessary.
895	it makes me sick that people seem to hate Obama for what is great about him. He confronted hard problems and he did a great job on them. He's a terrific president and I will vote for him all the way, based on his actions and if he doesn't do anything horrible in the future.
896	Being an intelligent, open-minded person who loves teaching and saving... but doesn't like being rooted in one position, I have to recanted on my statement about the deficit reduction. Bush, Obama, and Ted are playing a game of dice, and Ted has the winning hand. Middle class jobs are disappearing around the world at an alarming rate. If he can't handle that, then I would think he should consider the last three candidates, or maybe another new one. At any rate, he's a better chance at the table.  Thanks for the comment.I know you like that language. I do too, in fact I find it rather humorous. Gosh, when did every one become so precious, british, english?and proper and shabby? This language to me is the appropriate day for last night... Ha!
897	The Iraq war was the worst idea in the history of human thought. Imagine if Obamacare, which has nothing to do with the economy, also had the military industrial complex and the oil and gas industries at its core. That would be devastating to the middle class.
898	I have lots of things to say about Mr. Bush, but I'm not going to in this blog post. For the record, I think Hillary Clinton was a class act, based on what she herself said about using a bridge to illegally migrate across the border. Then again, let's face it. Hillary Clinton is only person who can claim to have taken that much polyester. Plus she probably married the wrong guy, so we'll never know what the hell she could have done had she never been married. Even though there are some Republicans that do think Clinton would be a good candidate, I really don't think she would win this election. Sorry, but there is no way he could get her. I also did a search through her campaign speeches, and she hasn't said anything about the disaster of Iraq or how awful she is. No, she hasn't. not for this president, or the last four; her entire platform is about overhauling the economy by lowering taxes, restoring the middle class, building the economy
899	Let's be fair. Most individuals don't believe that Bush did his best. I guess that's not so unusual. For one thing, didn't the mainstream media seem to strongly support him at first? We now see the real nature of what a sham he was. He indeed sold the Iraq war to everyone in a hurry. And the people we are fighting for in this war are the UN peacekeeping troops. The United States government is throwing 90% of the money at the war, and ten countries are passing huge oil contracts with Iraq.
900	Right now D.C. is running roughshod over the innocent and treachery, and those voting from the heart are being undemocratically muzzled by an old system and the usual suspects who like running things and creating barriers for truly committed democrats.     Now, this is my campaign and the words of the people need to be heard - even if they don't agree with you, that's OK. But let's not get discouraged and let's get out and vote.     ### Point of View: Let's make change a movement - not fear!
901	We need to enact term limits in the House and Senate. Candidates for these positions need to have no more than 2 terms if they want to have a shot. Good people want to help someone else, but they can't do it by themselves. It takes a special person to work on these various Bills and break them down into smaller pieces, and make sure to not let them derail the bill, too. There are unwilling people who are blatantly racist who will vote for them, since they're people who work for themselves.
902	I've been touched by politicians who want to return to work. But I won't be one. I've seen enough. One generation of Snubs has happened in washington. I hate them. The unregulated capital markets outperform the government regulation out there. When I put my money in the stock market, I'm not a politician.  ### Input:        The country will heal in time....allowing everyone equal opportunity, a free market, and a healthy economy. But there is so much poverty and suffering in the world - cause is clear. That's why I advocate the Green New Deal - to put Americans back to work. This carbon tax we are passing will cause you to have that gig job where you don't know when you'll get paid. We've got a broken bureaucracy - causing delay in everything. This does not make sense and won't help.
903	I've heard a lot about Long Fingers. If any of these scenarios happen we know who to blame. Only 2 things CAN be done: (1) people stepping up to make major changes and take the necessary actions, or (2) a well of credibility is saturated. We need to either push the current system to the edge or get radical people who will do that step up and finally get rid of the madness. The former seems like a high probability, so we need to keep pushing. Keep insisting on term limits, how many days does it take to build up to the end? 5 years? 6 years? Then just kill them. I've had enough of being sickened at all of the gossips and the ages and the terrible prejudices and even the venality. All I've seen is the average middle class move above us and the wealthy pay more and more taxes because they've got plans to hide. And I'm also tired of ignoring the crap stories that are so disturbing and scandalous from all the idiots who never speak up against real issues and think its all paint by the other team.
904	According to this rubbish of the bible we must destroy israel because they hate us and burn the bible if they catch us if we help them to come here to brazil so we can assasinate them then wash away all the blood where the sun don't shine. i know there is a holy war but are there no free men in congress? where are the good liberals?? and look what happened to guantanamo bay crazytard! one day the world will end and that is when we will finally kick the good ole boy ass that kept us and our rights under duress for so long. do we really want to live under that dictatorship where people of different faiths are killed and we as a nation are weak and a pacifist country and follow the laws that only work for the rich with no common sense for anyone else? as a former totalitarian government I am against any rule other than my own, where we all have common sense so we would all be equal. already we have a communist government with a totalitarian law that works for the same evil group and got most of us into poverty so let us have a competition here on my blog so we can declare who gets to feel free without any rules by giving out this very beautiful weaponry...
905	I'm shocked that you actually got fined for dropping a butt out of your window, especially since you had your trunk open.  The safest and best thing to do is to take your butt to court and try to discredit the officer's observation.  Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage?  Were there other cars on the road with you that could have dropped the cigarette out onto the road? The main question you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your butt?"  If you think that you can win the case then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system so great.  The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.
906	I don't think so. I would question that your explanation. I'm an attorney and I would look at your argument from every angle possible. At an all or nothing without any reasonable doubt and still expect a dismissal. That's why my portfolio has burned down on me and why someone sent me a youtube link. Know that I'm well paid and I don't need the money so by all means take it to court. No excuse, all possibilities.
907	I think you got fined for throwing a butt out of your window on purpose, I think you threw it while you were drunk and so were causing harm to the other drivers on the road.  I don't see where you get to stick your head back in your doghouse when your butt got trampled by the side of the road.  If you want to come visit my home I can host you and you can have a beer and some burgers.
908	I was fined for tossing my butt out the window. This does not prove that I am racists, or that I had any problem whatsoever with the officer. The officer is an enforcer and that's the job he got from the court. I would like to think that that would motivate him to treat me fairly and respectfully. The question is "Is my attorney willing to do the same for me?" This is the problem, all that we are left with is the police, which treat everything, including you and me, with the same level of bias they do all criminals. You need someone who will represent you that will do the same. A little contexto
909	Wow, can that really happen?!  I wish there was some way I could actually help you out, but as far as I know it is illegal in almost every part of the US.  I take no offense at all that you were charged with a fine, but you have nothing to worry about, because you can't be convicted of throwing a cigarette out of a window.  The main issue here is the speed of the incident.  The officers...
910	Seek legal advice to the company I work for, have a leave of absence for a few months, without my pay. Show them and them that I am beyond proud and honored to be part of them family and to be the best employee there is. Just go see the lawyer or lawyer to ask questions and not the entire time or go see them and beg for help.
911	Seek legal advice if you are in that situation. Most companies won't care and they know that most employees don't want the stress of starting a new job. If they don't care don't come back and they'll be less stressed! If you need me, just give me a call and let me know about your situation! I will be with you through thick and thin.
912	Don't resign! Just go to a lawyer. Obviously, there is a great possibility that you would lose your job. However, you can still get legal assistance. Maybe you just didn't get things to go according to your own wants. Usually, lawyers will prepare you for such a situation. They will also tell you if your chances are there.
913	Thanks. Very nice advice. This employer is so quick to fire people. Will take legal advice. I will! It's definitely expensive, but nothing is worth not being able to do your job for lack of funds. That's really sad! Thank you! I think people don't realize how quickly things can change in the tech sector. They get fired for no reason. Thank you for the advice!
914	Seek legal advice. If you will lose your job and maybe lose your home for lack of money. Do something before that happens. They company will be heartbroken I'm sure!!!!!! I have seen it to many times. Just ask a lawyer about your case, they don't have to know you asked them. The lawyer will tell you if you have a chance. It will not cost to ask.
915	Answer not in context Preliminary thesis: prisons are run by gangs? Is this real? No. Maybe? No. Certainly not! Are gangs always in prison? No. Some do, but not all. Does the law go into effect when the government acts? Yes. They have to do so. Who decides when they do? No. That is what freedom is. Both. No.
916	@jm Forte My sincere condolences on your loss. Some of you boys are our precious pride and joy. Slaughters do happen, unfortunately. Gangs, prison gangs, they run for parliament. Forgive me, you ladies.
917	To live you obey their rules, if not you could very well end up dead. It is sad to say but some of our prisons are run by the gangs inside them. The prisoners behind bars have it so good any more that prison is no deterrent to crime at all.
918	Inside, that would be prison. I don't think that the prison is a deterrent to crime, because some of the inmates are so filth they would be able to catch criminals, because they like to rob people who do not like getting robbed.
919	What is sad to say is that prison officials are helping the prisoners forget they even know the law in order to keep the gangs in prison happy. If this situation goes on it is little wonder criminal gangs are becoming a cancer in our society and have been in the last few years. Prison officials are destroying our country from within because they are criminals themselves, they don't think right or wrong - only profits.
920	She's a good mom, I think. Just think if her children needed their dad they would need it more than what she is giving them. I agree with the Court, they need their dad, or at least someone to walk them and talk to them now. She needs to think of her children not herself, and a good mom will do that. And I applaud her for always knowing what is best for the kids. That's certainly the situation that I'm in with my younger son who needs someone to talk to now more than me.
921	In a marriage, kids are an added bonus, so don't worry about it. Just save some money. Please, go see a specialist. Call someone for help for her. At work I enjoyed...

922	Hell no.. even if you knew what you did and just put you kids in a better circumstance. That is scary and criminal and you did nothing right by your son. He went to the wrong institution, who was a friend of his and brought him into all this mess. He is not going to walk out of this house like this, he's not 6. I can't imagine what he'll do and he deserves better than that... But you did horrible, however, maybe in the state that he is in, you will regain him again, but without locking him up.. I'll think about that
923	Yes I agree that if a family member has a strong ego, whether it be his kids' parent, his own child, the boy or the boy or whoever, he always wants to get his parents attention, his family back, always wants to feel loved. I feel for her, although I know from past experience (and I do not mean as a side glance) that one shouldn't excuse her mother's actions. If your sister wants to get her family back, her family back, her family back, I would really urge her to save some money. As for the punishment... again, each situation is different.
924	Whatever you do keep up your spirits and push on, it doesnt take much to make a big difference...good luck with everything and if you need anything just lets know...:* If I could do it again, I wouldnt change anything....:* Welcome to our little paradise by the seaside. This place has everything you need to feel comfortable, I wish you there with me <3
925	Welcome to Canada in the 21st century. Thanks for protecting my right to work and provide for my family and home like any other Canadian. Thanks for protecting the right to privacy and religious freedom. Thanks for all you can not only protect but champion gays and lesbians in these repressive days.
926	Speaking of gay people.......Jesus told us that everyone is born in sin, why do people continue being born in sinful body and actions? Why do people misuse so much time and energy to hate others for not working on their own personal growth? Why do the majority of us self-criticize for what we have done or what we have done not to do? The majority of us misuse our time and energy, wasting money, homes, lives, and resources in order to focus on an ugly place in which no real peace can be found - the place of sin. The majority of us cry and try to argue about what we would like to change in the face of someone else’s sin. Either everyone needs to get out of the sinful body in order to be free from sin and
927	Thanks guys!! Thanks America!! I very much love all of you for being so strong for me and for those that have found new reasons to hate and to be hostile towards our lovely country from the gay community
928	I am an advocate for strong family bonds with fair treatment of the LGBT community. I am appreciative of those fighting for this right in the USA. However, as a gay man, I am often treated unfairly and discriminated against in the workplace.
929	I work for a federal agency and there are no anti-gay attitudes, including from people who hold various government positions. Also, I am not married yet, but my partner has lived with me for 9 years. I do not have domestic partnership rights and, upon marriage, should not be fired. I am confident that I will be able to support my partner, but am open to doing so via a domestic partnership (my partner does not want that). I am grateful to be an American and for those fighting for what rights I do have.
930	Those who are calling for amnesty to be given to illegals have yet provided any rational reasons as to why they should be given citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and a replies as to why they hold no argument. "Deportation breaks up families" Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft. "Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do." This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do. "If they received amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do." - this line has no place in the discussion. It is all about supporting amnesty reform and the removal of barriers to a better life, but I wasn't mentioning that. Juts leave this line in. "Texas was Mexico's" This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status. "I have  plenty more, but I'll wait until a debate commences.
931	Those that want amnesty to be given to illegals have yet provided any rational reasons as to why they should be given citizenship.

Illegals do unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do. The fact of the matter is that illegals have contributed tremendously to our society by providing much needed services that many Americans refuse to do. No one has deemed illegals worthy of being given civil rights. They are our equals. “ Texas was Mexico's"   This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status. The fact of the matter is that illegals have contributed tremendously to our society by providing much needed services that many Americans refuse to do. No one has deemed illegals worthy of being given civil rights. They are our equals.
932	The truth is that the US housing market is no longer healthy, and the economy will soon be overtaken by Latin American economies. Mexico already has a left wing president, so amnesty proponents expect them to institute a socialist government. Even though the Mexican people came to the US voluntarily and have been here for generations, they have not yet gained full US citizenship. Even though US marraiges exist and many have been long standing, people who try to move to the US illegally have yet to receive back status due to government fraud. When illegals arrive in the US, they are also granted full, equal access to voting. Yet, regardless of the level of access illegal migrants have to voting rights, the American right wing still issues cries of “there’s nothing illegal about these illegals, they should get citizenship.” This is the harsh truth: the US is not a nation of immigrants, and illegals will never gain full rights at this rate.
933	Those who support amnesty to illegals have no evidence of proof that illegals are hurting the economy of the country in which they reside. Perhaps a drug war motivated by the welfare state will help the illegals continue their illicit activities and enable a few illegals to steal a large sum of money. There is no evidence of this either. Nonselective housing zoning that forces blacks into areas with small jobs will continue, disallowing blacks from upward mobility. Read Psalm 27:14-5 to see that many illegals should return to Mexico. It is not rocket science to determine that illegals would be most apt to start a war over the territory.
934	Stephen Miller was a former Representative from Texas who left politics after his negative campaign for re-election as a 2012 Democratic candidate to become the “Adviser to the President on Immigration Policy.” According to  Donald Trump, his previous president and predecessor President Bush "was right about illegal immigration,” something he vehemently denies. Trump used Miller’s opinion against his predecessor by constantly targeting him with this opinion for his undocumented citizens supporters. Trump used Miller's power (quote) through threats by publishing Miller's opinion online in place of the fact-checking (compare which platform Trump used, Hootsuite), to backfire on Miller's second point, during his debate with President Obama.
935	Imagine the day that there is no earth at all! How would science be able to proceed without the presence of our collective focus? For the sake of argument, let's assume that Wikipedia is still there, showing the history of a small human civilisation. What are we all doing? I have a question for you: What if your species, like most others on earth, were wiped off? How would aliens come to have a better understanding about us and the way we currently live? So much has been uncovered so far by a vast amount of information available. Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of our history. No other resource can provide more information than Wikipedia. In my opinion, Wikipedia is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collected together. Is the internet as a whole more reliable? Yes
936	Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable but they offer a general explanation about our species, the human race, and the beginning of human history. And the evolution of the internet, and Wikipedia as its largest exponent, have the combined power to push humans past their initial period of mass ignorance and toward a higher level of awareness.
937	If our species was wiped off the face of the earth, Wikipedia would provide an invaluable resource. In fact, without Wikipedia there would be no medium by which we could gain better insight about mankind. Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together.
938	Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source. So for the sake of my argument I would like to keep this discussion limited to one single resource.
939	Wikipedia's great and comprehensive coverage of human history may be one of the finest tools we have to understand our day-to-day world. The internet as a whole trumps Wikipedia, and the internet is a wonderful, full-fledged, online encyclopedia, but Wikipedia still has an advantage in one unique aspect: its coverage of human history. It is true that Wikipedia is less reliable than official sources, but that should not be necessary since it still takes the time and energy of people to make sure that no errors are made, and then spell it out as clearly as possible.
940	I have not been to all those Syria refugee camps, but let me tell you something. People like you believe being good and maybe God-loving is bad. My criticism is of things done by governments and policies made in a foreign land and applied to peoples who are just fine with those things happening to them because they are entitled to democracy.
941	Ethics come from your good fortune, not from external authorities. There is no reason you should live your life the way you like without hurting anyone. People free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound in THEORY, 100% pure capitalism won't work. Note that I am not advocating socialism, just controlled capitalism.
942	I'm not the one who created this topic by the way. But people free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound good in THEORY, all arguments are subject to free wills.
943	The subject of free markets and capitalism is important, and we should do more research into the advantages and disadvantages of a liberal business system in a capitalist economy. However, the writer never intended to support the government the way a communist would be. They wanted to make the case for a socially liberal Capitalist system, as a way to attain a utopian society.
944	I'm not the one who created this topic by the way. But people free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Marxist arguments sound good in THEORY, capitalism alone will never get rid of poverty, inequality, misery, brutality, hunger, homelessness, ignorance, racism, sexism, hunger, homelessness, ignorance, racism, sexism, extreme illiteracy, child sexual abuse, racism, sexism, extreme illiteracy, child abuse, terrorism, terrorism, lack of welfare state, corruption, capitalism will not work. Now would you have to argue against free-market capitalism, social democratic capitalism, socialist capitalism or other extreme forms of capital
945	Black people get into trouble and turn up in prisons way to frequently. The movies portray them as criminals that are beyond redemption. It must be pointed out that black people represent only one set of society, which are those who commit crimes. One clear indicator of this is that the majority of the world's prisoners are black people. The reason is that black people make up half of all criminals. There are way too many problems with television that are linked to black people and other minorities that are simply not represented well on TV.
946	Black people give a lot of bad name to the world. Whites don't get the spotlight that Blacks do when they are in prison. There aren't many American TV programs that are about whites being in jail. Rap is more popular in America than music. I want to bring more attention to whites and make it more like Rap. When whites get arrested for crimes, the public usually knows less about them, especially in comparison to black criminals being singled out on TV.
947	Every man believes himself to be the man who is scorned by others. This belief gives rise to resentments and hatreds. It is important to develop a sense of community to promote peace and stability. It is also important to remember that we all descend from the same source to create unity. We must cultivate compassion for others to overcome prejudice.
948	I am a black person. I think blacks are more prone to crime. I feel that black people give a bad name to whites. There are too many blacks in jail because they often commit more crimes than whites. I honestly can't think of any country singers who are white, who ever went to jail. I am on the side of those black musicians, who have been arrested.
949	Black people are a dumber lot and should only be taught civil rights and proper discipline. Even cops disrespect black people. Try hooking up with black people. They are as unprofessional as they are depressed. Racism is everywhere and lives in people and us white society. We get mobbed if we do not give them the appropriate licks and cocktails. There is an underground rap scene for black people because more than 50% of alljail inmates are blacks. The lack of coverage by the media should be pretty obvious and not a surprise. Politicians act like a minority has the right to go on for ever with their agenda. In some places where they have more control of the news, including in the corporations who run the media, things go down to this day! The media likes the fact that it is financially a victim. They exploit the disinformed to make a killing. However, there are people who have been in jail for a long time who are extremely educated, such as Royce L...
950	Machines are 1 shot to the head or taking the head off and its game over. Zombies its 1 shot to the head or taking the head off and its game over. Plus Machines Can Controle other Machines Like cars, supercomputers, Cell phones and a whole citys power sorce and plus military weapons like Jets and tanks etc. and once they get ahold of guns and such were gonna have a HUGE WAR on our Hands
951	Im Gonna say the Zombies, Because zombies they will spread through the whole world and you probably will not be able to stop them because their brains have been replaced with guano and they dont even think anymore... where would we be if they were peaceful and normal humans?. They make others die. They will become more and more dangerous.
952	Machines be gone period, zombies are like pocket sized armor exept for brains there was a civilization called Mayan civilization that was attacked by zombies it would later end causing massive disasters to the world and your country is at risk of it being the same as they were, besides zombies kill you like a mouse
953	Im gonna say zombies cause zombies dont care its an zombies life, its 1 shot to the head and its game over. It's a well known fact that machines are easier to kill. You dont take out arms, guns, cars and if you did they would just reload all automatically to fight back. Zombies have one shot to the head.
954	The Zombies is gonna end us and the Zombies will become more and more and that is why we have to be strong because the Zombies are very violent and never give up so this is what I think about that. So if I was Gonna start a war I would wanna be Slaughter and shoot everything before i give up like bye bye zombies.
955	I think the constant threat that people feel around security is a waste of time.  Anyone who's been at a concert or festival knows that security guards will usually just shout or press people who don't pay their dues. I didn't go to the beer pong because I didn't want to have my neck broken and I didn't really care that I didn't pay my dues.  Maybe you should get your ego in shape and then you would understand what paying my dues feels like.
956	If you want security to smash a couple's faces in in a club, I'm not going to stop you.  I'm not going to protect you or those I cannot protect.  You're welcome to keep your feelings in your sleeve, here is a safe haven for the reason we are at a club, not a prison yard.  Look at all that alcohol in here!  You can't harm me or my guests.  We like to have fun and if you don't like it, just move off my property.  Now might as well go home before a bunch of twat parents come and you scream at me.
957	I don't actually care, but nor do I care about whether or not Tiesto is playing or not.  Security is necessary to prevent the inappropriate behavior of guests who wish to enter the club, and that's something that nothing I've discussed here is trying to provide in any way. In fact, the club's management, which is responsible for hiring employees, has a high interest in minimizing the prospect of doing this kind of misconduct.
958	Great job I would do well with them as a security guard.  You'd be great as my bodyguard, but all security are body-blots. They can't handle a non-alcoholic shake.  Oh no I can't. It will kill me. I know how you feel, I'm that guy.
959	I understand your frustration and that the wedding security should have been more approachable and then not act harshly but not play victim and make it seem like he is the bigger person that needs to change.  I do not know why you called me, I really do not care, I just wanted to say I was sorry and that I hope you and your fiancé get along great and that you can make out in less stressful than you have been for most of your lives and that was my thing.  THANK YOU   I mean people don't get along because the economy is bad, people don't get along because of a small few comments, people don't get along because of religious reasons, people don't get along because of the wrong political beliefs, people don't get along due to their drug use, people don't get along for the wrong reasons..
960	Their advertising promises were great but food was no good.  They clearly have no taste in food. they should not be in business in this day and age.  I plan on never returning to a restaurant in Manhattan. It was to date my worst experience. never going there again. It was so bad that when I walked out...I didn't think there were any other people there. do yourself a favor  and never go there. I repeat never go there. We ate at a buffet that was better. I will never go to Carpe Diem ever again and don't suggest you either. I will eat out with my friends at places I trust so don't waste your money at this loony establishment.
961	While we were there, we saw many employees left sidelined. I don't know how bad of a time they had but their "anniversary" was not especially special. The food was pretty bad, the decorations were not unique, and the service was...bad. Maybe we weren't exactly what they are looking for when they were first announced as Carpe Diem ... was their location right? The reason we went there in the first place, before any review is due, was for our anniversary, and after the first shot, we decided to...leave.
962	We stayed away from Carpe Diem. They serve mediocre food and it's expensive. We found other restaurants that did a better job of bragging about their dishes on the menu and wrapping them in nice descriptions. We would not go back. Ignore the comments and continue to consult the 'google map'. We unfortunately got to know many of the servers and their dogs and how terrible their conditions were! An unheavenly business! A disgrace!
963	Based on this experience, we will not try Carpe Diem again. Of course, if I spent even half the amount at Fine Food tonight I could come up with a better-quality dining experience, but it is this kind of night where one over-spends on the wrong items. And we are not terrible cooks. We can find new restaurants if this does not impress you. All over-shade, under-dressed and eat dirt with your fingers. Lack of understanding.
964	I don't want to dwell on what the meal was, given that it's been over a month, but suffice it to say that it's not a place we plan on visiting again. Budget limitations meant that we spent half of our anniversary evening at Carpe Diem. We felt the food was unfulfilling - the flavor, the presentation, and the service just didn't capture the value we were hoping to receive. I got in the elevator and pushed our new 3-star rating on their app.
965	I would wear whatever suit you handed me when I got into the class. I believe the bible is the best text for understanding life and people the most noble of all man
966	I have no idea, don't make it any less personal. I actually only partially agree with college education on the part of teachers and staff, though, because of the corruption and extremely high pay.
967	I disagree with the restrictions of school uniforms. I believe that school uniforms enable school age children to wear their personal style. Furthermore, I think it is very unethical and unprofessional to withhold equal education for students of different ethnic backgrounds.   ### Instruction:  rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I prefer Western culture
968	I think school uniforms are a terrible idea, because they hinder free speech. I do not believe in any voluntary association. I do not agree with compulsory education and would not wish my children to be educated in such an environment. I think school uniforms suppress free speech and discourage individual expression.
969	I really do not agree with school uniforms. This will totally promote body hatred for the shape of every body of every youth across the country. Every day, it's taught that a student should want to feel, dress, and look in the best possible way to set themselves apart from the norm. This will not encourage extreme thinking and will instead turn students into conformists who will ultimately be passive victims to the violent
970	If my wife committed murder and I knew about it I wouldnt turn her in, and even if she didn't know about it and I know she would never forgive me, I'd still defend her.
971	If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.
972	The scenario asks you about whether you would have to turn someone in if he did something bad to his wife. In this case, you would probably not want to. Consider your relationship with your wife.
973	I do not condone the actions of my wife (she committed murder, which is against the law in the US, punishable by at least 5 years to life), but I do not care to try to turn her in. I love her and would be proud to have her back though good or bad.
974	What is the principal rule in Eureka 7.?? Murder is against the law in Eureka 7.
975	You didn't know? Of course you didn't! The Ottoman Empire was the most successful empire on earth. Not to mention you!
976	As a child I loved wrestling and football, nba and other sports were n't like what I saw on tv, it was fast paced, there were many beautiful people in it and when my favorite teams played it was a true
977	No, India was the largest economy in the world for a few centuries under the Mughals. It was also ruled by Muslims, English, Hindus and someone else who did not take any interest in international treaties.
978	Haha, no.  India was most successful when it was ruled by the hindu kingdoms, they can't even lead themselves.
979	I support national unity. If we were all around the same size with the same wealth then we could all have unity across the world.
980	I don't use the word 'defiled'. I use the word 'lame'. Quoting myself: "There have always been storms and wars, and there always will be, because human nature is flawed and selfish."
981	Relax, there's a tax on nationalism. It all gets swept under the table! You could probably get over $2 billion from slaughtering all the dolphins and elephants...
982	I'm a greenpeace activist. As an outdoors person, I refuse to allow poor people to pollute themselves on the world's largest reservoir of impure water - the Ganges. Since they're not allowing their communities to survive, let them be the next victim to die from starvation.
983	Shit! Still so many cockroaches at the Russian embassy in Washington who make a boatload of money by buying that lottery that barely beats the odds. Still no middle class in Sweden.
984	People are so horrible. All they do is hide their garbage under garbage like they are incredibly clean. The Ganges is the nearest river and rivers are so dirty. The only planet a person can manage? The one on which they live.
985	I would rather be father less it might sound bad but I dont want to think of my father as a lousy one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just keep bringing you problems. You dont have to have a father you can talk to someone else. Maybe its just because I am girl it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.
986	My father was a father if you have a bad father thats okay but I dont have to have a father. Mom for some reason people think their mothers the most awesome one they will know. But actually i dont like that she always makes sure she does me what i want like my mom did to me her mom should be better than my mom.
987	I would rather have a mother than a father because I just dont understand a father. I have a mother. She is great! Where would you be if you didnt have a mother? Maybe the best answer would be if you had a father that allowed a man to rape your sisters and you were the only man in your family. And you never spoke to or asked her about it cause you just couldnt believe people would be that bad. I would also say if you had a father that treated your mother and you sisters badly then you didnt know who you were until you left home. You had to reinvent your life. I like to focus on my life right now than having another father.
988	I wish I could take back my hardship that caused my father to become less than who he was. I wish things could have been different for me. There were many people who went through more extreme hardships and they were able to face them. Maybe things could have been different if my father had not been born or if he did not grow up in the big city and become a street person. It would also be better if my parents were still alive and were able to talk to someone who knew them intimately instead of someone who just sees them because they make money. However, I do not hate or feel remorse towards those who helped my father in his life because I know they had no choice and should not be judged.
989	I wish I was a parent less would be nice to have a friend I can talk to about anything. I would like to know more about my mother. I am sure she is very nice. I would have a great family.
990	I am 100% correct but I don't wear pink tank tops. I think the PE coaches will think better of us if we had better clothes. I think that the coaches can see us.
991	You are 100% right because I am in Pe and they make us wear these stupid outfits. I think they make us wear those so the Gay coaches can see our private parts. and PE is just Stupid.
992	Because I think they think that Gays are sex objects and something to avoid for PE or gym class.
993	You are 100% right I AM IN PE and they make us wear those stupid outfits. and PE is just Stupid
994	You are 100% wrong. I was raised in Catholic. I have never felt stupid or uncomfortable in any sport, and I don't get pissy when athletes have sex, as many others do. That is a violation of the Sabbath, and it should be forbidden.
995	William Farquhar's drive and initiative had led to modern Singapore. He is revered by the majority of Singaporeans because he had led the nation to where it is today. Nevertheless, some would not.
996	Consider this. Raffles did not change Singapore's development. Farquhar disobeyed the rules and ultimately his contribution was ignored. He loved his country very much. He worked hard to help Singapore develop, however he was power hungry and had little integrity.
997	William Farquhar was a leader who sacrificed for his people and my thoughts on Singapore's development and a future leader which I see in Lee.
998	Raffles was a successful colonial ruler who influenced Singapore's development. William Farquhar was underpaid and overstretched as governor, and did not understand Raffles' motivations in appointing him. Despite his many achievements, he has in large part been mistreated.  Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money
999	I'm not sure what you mean here Farquhar was sacked for his ideas in the formation of Singapore's development? Yes. I would've assumed that it was because his policies were contradicting his boss's.
1000	No, i got a cardboard screwdriver somewhere that's screwed right into a bottle of water.
1001	Omg maybe i should get some snow butter...
1002	This reflects my state of mind,thats all.
1003	I have a bottle of water next to me that I can't get away from.
1004	I'm lusting for water. Don't have any myself!
1005	Banning bottled water in your state could hurt your state economy. The bottled water companies make billions each year. American are caught in the middle between a hidden waste of resources and fast growing prices for much needed goods. Many of us are already facing a shortage of water supplies, further exacerbated by the after effects of global warming. Furthermore, America should continue to focus its resources on finding a cure for diseases. The U.S. people do not need another wasteful corporation to make a killing off of us.  ### Input: Amazon dominates the market so companies need to make sure they remain competitive. Amazon is under threat from Yahoo and Apple.
1006	Banning bottled water would only cause economic damage to big companies like Dasani and Nestle. Millions of Americans use and purchase bottled water and they rely on bottled water during disasters such as hurricanes, inclement weather and wild fires. They also rely on bottled water as it makes it a lot easier to transport and store water.
1007	A person should be judged by the content of their character and not by their immediate appearance. I would recommend writing your thoughts in an open format on a blog. You will immediately remove insults and trolls, as long as you keep your content to a manageable level.
1008	I don't think the government should intervene in what I choose to drink, and my choice to drink water may affect my health because of my gut. A person should be able to decide for themselves what they want to drink. Currently, if you ask an American, they probably will have a water bottle for their water.
1009	Banning of bottled water would certainly hurt the economy. Almost all Americans use and purchase water bottles daily. It would hurt big corporations in addition to thousands of manufacturing companies that would have to replace and make new bottles to produce water. For that reason, the ban would certainly hurt the economy.
1010	I don't care what you feel about homosexuality. I'm gay myself! I believe homosexuality is a choice, so who cares what gay men and women are doing to themselves.
1011	Anyone can do anything they want in the world. They just need to be big enough. But let's not forget the Pope.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I still think homosexuality is wrong even if I'm the gayest guy in the world. Read
1012	I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel
1013	HOMOSEXUALITY IS WRONG!!! IT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU WALK AROUND SEEING PEOPLE THAT YOU REALLY LIKE AND YOU TRY TO SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE HAVING WORRY OF SEEING YOUR LOVELY
1014	I was born in Europe. Europe has always been secular. Europe value the rights of all human beings. The west owe a debt of gratitude to human rights organizations which saved millions from slavery and imprisonment. I also find that communism has never helped the cause of social justice. I agree that human being are intrinsically evil, and I believe the true
1015	The recent financial crisis had ruined the global economy .........India along with Japan and the US has an awful lot of experience in this matter.......India can turn this around...........
1016	By the greedy leader Manmohan singh India has the opposite effect to the world economy......he is insulting the entire country by committing financial misdemeanours that clearly harm many of the lower middle class......he looks like a luxury trader instead of the value of true business leader......Who knows.....perhaps he will become the best politician in the world after Manmohan singh
1017	Only imperfect markets are right. Will cement violence is not sustainable world economic system. we need economics taught with multiple indoctrination from markets, good governance in workplaces, measuring factors to all processes of economy. Choices . We need to use if people only had understood market and scientific process . power of markets working as good controllers of state regulation. Indian should have worked for integrity,
1018	India is great.....b..because u can appreciate its people as ppl.When u do bth u understand each other's culture
1019	India can't lead the world. Its economy is not strong enough. India has been judged as not being aggressive and because of that, there are many soldiers stationed in Pakistan........India doesn't have a strong army, so it shouldn't lead.
1020	Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
1021	One thing, we do not need a religion to understand life. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere.

God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere. God is everywhere
1022	Yeah..... me, too. Also, I'm not mad at the lack of recognition because I believe the internet is important in representing the views of many and the best way for us to get the word out is through sharing, and together we can achieve many great things.
1023	I am disappointed with lack of recognition, because I am a Christian. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism, I think that most christians in America would desire the recognition of their religion.
1024	A close friend and I have a joke that if you were to ask me who I was, I would answer "I am an atheist who identifies as a Christian, and an active Pastafarian." To which we would shrug in agreement at your commentary, "As if being an active Pastafarian does not mean you believe in Jesus Christ. If you were to tell me who I am, it wouldn't be enough to make me be faithful to you." The government should recognize all religious acts, and should not bring pressure upon religious beliefs, just as they don't at all take away equal rights for gays.
1025	It's terrible to think that anything negative can come from murdering a person, it must make a person feel utterly unscrupulous even if he intended to help someone. I would certainly like to see someone sentenced for my partner's murder, as he killed someone who was unarmed and potentially innocent.  I'd, however, welcome this opportunity to develop my skills as a homicide investigator. I think the sole purpose of the criminal justice system is to make money to enrich already wealthy people. While this is intended to benefit society overall, I am...
1026	I feel like I would be unfit to serve as a homicide detective being ambitious and young. I strongly suggest that you focus on something else to become a successful man. I am not the best judge of whether my father would have disapproved of my ambitions and do not know how he may have felt about his own son choosing the criminal justice field. However, judging from his actions towards me and my family up to this point I don't really think he would have been supportive of my dreams in either way.
1027	Having been pursuing the dream to become a homicide detective, I find that the path to being a lawful, successful, homicide detective is extremely difficult and requires a certain amount of luck. To give a murderer a graceful send off is to disregard logic and hope the murderer will prove not guilty in court. In an attempt to find a better method of being able to determine if a murder has occurred, a three pronged attack is a great way to know for sure that the crime is not a pleasure/fulfillment/kill. Ultimately, no person can prove a murder has happened so, if they can establish that the crime wasn't a pleasure/kill, that makes them at least put someone else in jail
1028	A person ambivalent towards Christianity isn't likely to be any more open minded or liberal than someone who has already been convinced it is evil, conservative or counterproductive to society. So no, never try to alter one's religion for me; that is the duty of their god. And, a murderer is a murderer, regardless of how murderous they think they are.
1029	I am not the type of person that would, of, would murder for pleasure/malicious-kill, but I would murder for some legal reason, in order to not be convicted. Even if it would put me in prison for life, just to say, "I killed someone for some legal reason". I actually believe that I would have already murdered the person, even in my awareness. I do not support the concept of double jeopardy. I understand that there are good people out there, and that in the hands of an incompetent judge, if they go on trial, they might get off on lesser charges.
1030	It's not the woman's body here, it's a new life, and I don't support irresponsible pregnancies. That was just my opinion.
1031	The Champ, It is not a Woman's body, it is the new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible don't let a new life die for it
1032	The Champ (Champagne) is that bad? NO! This is among the worst, getting it in this post, verily bad!
1033	Thank you for sending in such an interesting and thoughtful comment. Women bodies are incredibly fragile and not everyone is willing to undertake the burden of giving birth.  In some parts of the world, they could be viewed as a medically necessary option but, for most of us, that's fine. But it is also a beautiful privilege to nurture the lives of new humans and hope they will take after

1036	Physical exercise is not a solution in itself, but becoming fit is critical to living a healthier, more active life. Maybe they
1037	I am not that much interested in sports. They are very much about competition and materialism. I exercise to keep fit.
1038	Physical exercise is not really important. I believe that health is first. When you get that you are well, you can do whatever
1039	Physical exercise in life is very important.
1040	Both are very important. The great question is what is the common good that helps us all improve. Probably how we treat each other but what or how does not really matter as long as we achieve this common goal. This ends the post. I wrote this post to help myself and some other people that might see this post.
1041	There are no better arguments for what these things are. The Bible's importance is its integrity, helpfulness, and the accuracy of its logic and explanations of human nature. Betsie Ponyaki mentioned that they both have significance. In reality I think we would all benefit from limiting the hours on an  internet site, which consumes all of your time and divert you from seeing what is right in front of you. Betsie Ponyaki listed several good things in their respective arguments. It would be better for everyone to focus on each other, keeping each other around to improve each other and to embrace what good the internet has to offer while limiting the hours of the internet to the absolute minimum.
1042	The purpose of life is to become fit and strong and after we have enough free time, then we can create history and write about it. For me personally life is not like a thing that you have to have and it is all happening for us on time whether we know it or not. It's got hope and there's not really more to life and therefore who cares whether you think it's the same.
1043	I wouldn't choose one better, because the advantages and disadvantages are quite apparent. Each of these factors can either enhance or degrade the quality of your life and it has a direct impact on your judgement. Everyone gets to evaluate these factors. A person hopes to improve themselves and become a better person not always for others but for the environment around him. The harmonious balance of these two factors creates a less stressful, happier environment. This creates an environmentally efficient, living hell of a world.  ### Instruction: Comment
1044	I believe that good is a pursuit and not only are both of the pursuits good, but that both can move a person forward if they are practiced. It is about the pursuit itself, whether you are leaning more towards love or power, and by using the teachings of one you will make better choices. I truly believe that these two people can move a person in many different ways, who they fall for and are bound by the choice they make. Both of these personal pursuits are good, and neither are anything but an escape from life and the circumstances that transpire around us. As much as I love him, I truly think that there is power in both the pursuit of power and the pursuit of love.
1045	take care being on your own, from the night life, from drug taking, from the media, from a bunch of dumb guys who just want to tease you and "beat" you up. be aware when you are walking, alway, always, wth are your legalized attacht.dont ride alone at night, dont sleep at bars alone. take precautions where you are drinking. dont let some guy poke you, squeeze your tits, etc...
1046	mostly because its just good viewing and history keeps repeating itself. One big sugar daddy (man) will always long to hook up with two young, beautiful girls. This is a constant source of payoff for the likes of MLK Jr. , White House Secretary Rumsfeld etc.   and to be aware of your own safety is the best way to protect yourself from them. Bottom line... you'll either get raped or go directly to jail. It's easier to go directly to jail but you lose out on your dream of hooking up with two sexy young girls and have your dream fulfilled.
1047	So if there are a lot of clubs and music bars in town,the chances of a rape happening is more likely to happen.because that is where the strangers pick up girls and you don't know them or what's their intentions.why have unsafe people playing in clubs if people don't use condoms anymore.my position on drug laws is that if you 're going to do something illegally,here are so MANY other ways you can handle it without having to go the extra mile.
1048	because many girls take every guy they meet at the disco or bar and make it to the latest party, even if its unsafe and just to look cool.  pretty much anything can happen, but that doesnt mean it won;t happen.. there is a higher chance of a boyfriend slipping up or being hammered on drugs then a guy who hasnt been hammered on drugs before because... for a girl, that is because she is setting herself up for failure (think if the guy isnt in the drug scene, he might not understand her alerts or excuses).  for a guy, theres no sense to hide that he is hammered and doesnt know what he is doing..  because many ppl like to assume (including cops) that all the guys are out drinking with the girls at the disco  where all that boring stuff takes place.  but, its mostly the rare guys who slouch around the disco, just drinking and looking upset while their girlfriends look cool and thrilled...
1049	girls need to be careful about all of these factors to not become a victim. they should be aware of the possibility of rape, take care, look for guidance and a moral compass from somewhere. such as religious figures, parents, or teachers, they should know the value of good old fashioned consent. similarly, girls should think about their own behavior. some days they might want to do what this conversation wants to convey , but they should try to control themselves on those days.
1050	The man failed to comprehend what he was talking about, and I am presuming that he is selfish and manipulative. I will leave it at that, as the information being provided is irrelevant to what you are trying to do.
1051	I don't know what she hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama.  Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it.  Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types.  They will suck you dry.
1052	I am just delivering a lecture. I want you to know that there is no free lunch. If you just don't like what I said, then it's none of my business.  That's what lawyers are for, anyway. I would just rather that you stop listening to this guy and take a good hard look at who you are and what you want.
1053	I did not know the lady recording the conversation had any interest in contributing to a court case. I would never interfere with a conversation. However, I would need to know who the lady was, and where she was located, in order to help the police return her vehicle to her.
1054	I think the woman recorded the conversation for the purpose of making much more drama then it really deserved and actually making herself look like a drama queen.  She should be ashamed of herself for recording the conversation and getting herself arrested on that "evidence".  The harassment came from that recording and not the original situation.
1055	I don't agree with capital punishment. I don't think that things will change much even if capital punishment is banned. International law says that a person who has committed heinous crimes should be in prison for life. A person who has committed a crime which is beyond the limit of rationality should be given severe imprisonment, as he should not be above the law. In India, law commission has done a lot to improve the system for better and fair justice system. I urge the government not to ban capital punishment and lets find a better way to punish criminals.
1056	I think that capital punishment should not be banned. Though its application should be in a non-cruel manner. To reform the criminal, the punishment should be effective and effective. In Indian system, i find that the case of I.K.Kapoor is better in comparison to Trump. Trump like event should not be done to helpless and innocent girl...
1057	I disagree that capital punishment should not be banned. The above argument is not logical. Capital punishment is not cruel. It involves leaving the convict to die in a most humane way without fear and in pain. In fact, it helps deter others from doing heinous acts. Capital punishment helps mend the criminals and makes good people, who are in need of reform. I strongly recommend that Capital punishment should be considered even as a last resort.
1058	My position is that capital punishment should not be banned, as human nature is inherently inbuilt with intranchenic fights and rages to fight for survival. If a person is considered to be beyond the process of reformation, taking into consideration the fact that serial killers, psychopaths and other heinous criminals have become better behaved and survived, capital punishment is against the humanity. Even law commissions have stated that it should not be banned. I strongly support capital punishment, and will encourage other countries to follow suit.
1059	I have not travelled across the world but I do not agree with the statement as I have witnessed the numerous parts in the country where there is a good police surveillance system, and the usual criminals do not harm public because they are completely out of the system. Another fact I would like to highlight is that... the murdering, raping, stealing and drug-using criminals do not even care for the lives of others.
1060	The NY Times is just one of several media outlets that repeated the false "911 Funding" story. Bush's accusations that he is committed to "hacking the system" to do what he sees as "legitimate government" are the major goal for the entire "war on terror".
1061	Take it easy guy! Cheap shots all the way, eh? You might want to ask yourself why they did all these things while we were busy fighting back in Iraq. Hey ... how about you go over to the other side and see how they treat you then?
1062	What a shame. You shouldn't. The right of free speech is totally justified. Free media organizations publishing different viewpoints on various issues. It's a democratic country, and that includes the ability for people to engage in civil discourse. If you want, you can run for office, and prove that what you're saying is true. By the way, since 9/11 has the Federal Reserve printed $33 trillion, to prop up Wall Street's already beligerant place on the world financial scene. What a demagogue he is. An obviously megalomaniac.
1063	I know how this really works. To be honest, I believe that George W. Bush administers the government most efficiently. This is my point! You want me to see this? If so, just use a simple Google search on "Federal Reserve Bank of New York" to get to the truth. He is intentionally broadcasting misinformation.
1064	Don't you mean the NY Times? It is better to choose your terrorist attacks and the right paper that they go to because in this way, you would hope to discourage them from continuing to fund terrorists.... over the past twenty years, it seems that every terrorist attack is associated with terrorism and Israel, in order to solicit the march of Muslims not legitimate terrorist organizations who are supporters of the legitimate government! This is not a recent move with the democrats, this is what they do and know best!
1065	I don't know what your saying. The fact is marijuana is used in a very specific way and THC (the active ingredient) is potentially very dangerous to the average user. It can be lethal to those with low tolerance. There have been countless stories of people being disposed of in the literature. Please take it down from your constant rant. There are other drugs out there that are way worse than marijuana and many of them aren't legal on the black market either. They all kill people.
1066	People who want to eradicate marijuana are hypocrites and criminal elements. Addiction, particularly drug abuse, is not confined to marijuana - it affects every adult. Furthermore, marijuana is much less harmful than alcohol and tobacco. Plenty of evidence exists that shows marijuana is safer than alcohol. Illegal drugs are still much more dangerous to users than is normal marijuana use. It should be legal to use any of these items, as long as you have the proper say of the product.
1067	I'm an advocate of marijuana legalization. That's because it's the only thing that might end this violence. This is not just a case about the use of the product - it's about people being all over themselves. And try not to listen to what the government tells you, because it almost never tells the truth! We're here to freely make our own decisions based on reality. It's never even been proven to be an illegal substance. It's highly addictive - and most of the violence stems from the usage of this drug! Just because someone has been ordered to get treated for a case of marijuana use doesn't make it legal! If you want to legally get high, learn about it, it's legal, legal, legal!
1068	Schooling, which is supposed to be a pathway for economic freedom, is anything but for me. If possible, I'd start to seek out alternative forms of health care education that center on natural healing and preventative medicine rather than depend on doctors and pharmaceutical companies to keep us healthy. Secondhand smoke, frankly, and other chemical poisoning from legal substances, are much worse to our health than the little blue pills that's required for chronic pain management. And the biggest problem with taking drugs, at least in my case, is that the roads are devoid of police and the police aren't responsible enough to enforce the rules. I've given up on US and the overwhelming majority of laws, policies, educational systems, value systems and attitudes. They have become purely defensive—justifications for conforming and complying—to escape from the pain of all that is wrong.
1069	We can become so accustomed to the lies of those who praise "difficulty" and then allow it to be popular. The truth is: The government didn't ban marijuana, it only legalized it. Now more and more people are passing out and drinking too much water, and therefore endangering their lives. This is not acceptable for an educated person to find as a fact when considering their own health. Having the legalized marijuana has, in my opinion, led to a rise in drug use. So, what should be done? This is what makes it easier for people to be drug addicts.
1070	It is completely unfair that someone who can be rehabilitated is treated as though they were not worthy of life. No person is beyond redeeming... and with today's high cost of living, more rent and less real estate, something that costs $25 for a gallon of water would need to be made sustainable in an all water world. Another example would be that the resources for food and clothing would need to be shared fairly to end the wars caused by greed and greed for wealth. A farmer's best friend would be a variety of plant seeding on an unspecified scale and cultivation practices.
1071	I believe drug use is wrong, and it hurts people and therefore needed to be addressed.  However, I can see a sense in a different system for handling troubled cases. However, there is something not right about the sentence given to a woman.  None of the previous sentences say anything about supporting gender equality and I agree with that.
1072	Here is an article about this: http://www.vice.com/watch/question-foiled-by-stupidity/24 আউট ফর682S5yKnV_y/?hd=1   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Maybe if our country allowed more hours for workers to be productive, but America is such a hypocrite. Some companies allow employees to work more hours, just so they can make more money, while much of the country remains stagnant. Also, when companies that use minorities.
1073	Even when the sentence was ridiculous to begin with, I hope to see more tolerance towards convicts, such as women who are in prison for drugs instead of jail time. The hope is that they are learning and growing as they work towards self-improvement through therapy.  These drugs and alcohol addictions that many people have are hard to overcome and contain the risk of entering prison or jail.    The sentence “That’s high praise” is also ridiculous.
1074	I agree with the sentiment of the new second sentence, but shouldn't it take more than 17 years to get a nonviolent drug offender out. I am also interested in the fact that she was twice as likely to get convicted as a violent criminal.
1075	Was it a mistake? Yes, please stop cheating and we'll both move on. Stop trying to take advantages of the people. If they have been looking out for you for 20-30 years, you shouldn't just stop trusting them. Using their hard earned money in drug dealing is not any better than theft. Get a good, reliable place to live and have a good work ethic. I would say thanks.
1076	To be eligible for unemployment you have to be on the dole... You commited fraud today and all that.  That's why. It's tough out there but I'd keep working and staying in school. It gets better. It's a very competitive place to live. Pity state gave up the easy way.  The state is losing money.
1077	Were YOU eligible for unemployment?  If not then you've committed FRAUD.  This can be a felony in most states.  I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you.  They will notice this and catch on to it.  Today in most states employeers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws.  This will be a way for them to catch you.  The other main way is with your taxes.  When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands and/or your name.
1078	Were you eligible for unemployment?  If not then you've committed fraud.  This can be a felony in most states.  I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you.  They will notice this and catch on to it.  Today in most states employeers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws.  This will be a way for them to catch you.
1079	I would recommend filing a claim for unemployment, due to lack of work. There were limits on this month's unemployment ins for those who thought they would qualify. Being employed is more commonly a merit than a need. Of course, being incarcerated also affects the small business you may work for.
1080	Recruit foster parents. Pay the government less money. Prosecute whoever supports reducing funding for foster care. Talk about the problems with cities. Create a system of public education. Focus on upbringing, not academics. Give everyone equal opportunity. Throw out the welfare system. Free up more jobs. Focus on small business owners rather than those who suck up to the government. Cut taxes on small businesses. Encourage collaboration rather than competition. Save money.
1081	i don't know where you're getting the idea they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care.  it costs the state tons of money.  my sister does this for a living and their departements are severly underfunded and understaffed.  the workers do what they can but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officals that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads the situation is not going to improve.  it's really sad.  my sister alone has about 50 cases and she's sposued to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least 1 visit and go to court monthly for each of them.  there's just not enough hours in a day.  each caseworker should only have about 20 cases but they don't have the funding to hire enough people.  i hope your situation works out.
1082	I never personally take benefit from paying taxes, so i don't understand what you are talking about. not anymore... http://www.yahoo.com/ussia/united-world-religions gets me.  God bless. i just had to laugh at your post. be grateful for the people who do, and don't need to wonder if there is a God... your lack of faith in God makes you a much better person. enlisted and grew up in military spouses of soldiers, it always seemed to me as if it was a COMMON courtesy to accept the recruiting center invitation to visit the AMMUNITION dump to see for themselves, rather than just believing what the records told you about it, that my husband, who had never been out of the country, had done so.
1083	I believe in the destruction of Israel, the United States and all other countries that commit atrocities. I do not believe the United States can, or should, be led. I also believe that traveling and leaving a footprint has little purpose, and can actually be harmful. The next man to step foot on Earth will be the first to commit genocide because of human nature. I believe that human beings are fundamental to the continuation of life.
1084	At least they get money when she isn't fighting foster care and welfare reform. But they are not happy most of the time. Her workload is huge. That is why she is tired. She is good at her job. The outcry may be deceiving. Because of court hearings, visits, court complaints, meetings, etc. she has to keep things in order because she is under pressure. Unfortunately, the child welfare workers are in the minority.
1085	I think that in a multiethnic society, you shouldn't yell "Fire!" in a crowded theater; who knows that many people will enjoy the fireworks and may have a limited role, if any. In fact, I'm not opposed to firework showings, but I'd only watch mine at home, unannounced. I'm against sex outside marriage, among all other causes. I'm against even talking about an African country which is not on the map, no matter what attempts you make to impress the poor countries of the world with "living conditions" that we are the best in the world.
1086	Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to exercising my right to say what I want but you can't really swing your arm in an crowded theater with a gun. That's just completely illegal and unsafe. Let me get this straight, you are considering drawing a line between the right to say and do whatever we want UNLESS it harm someone. On the surface of things, this makes sense but perhaps you should consider drawing this line if you REALLY want what you want in the most prudent and responsible way. For instance, if someone did hit you on the arm with a bottle, would they be entitled to say or do what they did to you IF and ONLY IF they DID IT ONLY FOR TO VICTIMIZE YOU? if you just would not, oh if you just would not..
1087	I ask again, what the hell is the point of a liberty to say whatever the hell you want to say if someone you don't know can be killed? The risk that they will be killed or harmed if you say something you shouldn't is enough to make your right to say anything should be limited by the courts. It is just a simple fact. That is why it is called liberty and to say whatever you want to say.
1088	I completely support your right to say what you want--assuming that your words aren't going to hurt someone else. Thanks for the ref. On the plane back home I was severely misanthropy by one of the girls. She seemed to feel entitled to be relentlessly rude towards people. What I decided to do was stop talking to her completely. She made a huge fuss about her choice so I opted for the minimum effort. It worked and the angry screams softened considerably. She apologized, thankfully, and we all got on with our lives.
1089	You are talking to a member of the public. I am talking to a high-level corporate executive. Clearly I should have taken a longer vacation. Just feel free to make suggestions and offer your views and I'll be sure to use them in the discussions I will engage in in the future, in appropriate places. None the less, a disclaimer is in order.  All my comments and analyses are based on "reasonable premises"; beliefs, assumptions, generalizations and the unreasonable questions frequently asked of me in interviews are not facts. I take no position on why anyone's intentions are "constructive" or "hostile". Personal attacks and antagonism toward another in order to provoke conflict are not productive dialogues and are not constructive at all. In the future, feel free to email me directly with your comments and observations. Seeing as how I have been through all these embarrassing moments, I feel it only appropriate to warn you of who you may potentially be upsetting.
1090	I totally agree. I oppose this idea, and I don't care how ineffective it is. Even if it does not use marijuana in pure form, and all the parts are used for alternative medicine (various parts of the plant, how's that for a douchebag?) then it is still 100% safe, and not a gateway drug; it's a different thing from hemp seed oil. It could be an alternate, legitimate source of revenue in many parts of the world. That is if its legalized, of course; it is open to interpretation.
1091	Not true. There has been no legalization of marijuana in the United States or any other country where it is legal to use marijuana and the rate of THC, the compound that makes people marijuana-fed, is low because of the extremely intense psychoactive ingredient of the hemp plant. It's not legally regulated because it is not a regulated drug and is therefore not subject to the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act. This is a very smart, fact based and reasoned response.
1092	I don't want to use weed, or any other illegal drugs, or drugs in general for recreational purposes. I want someone to stop me from doing it, but if I do, that's what I will have to do. As a matter of fact, I use marijuana for medical purposes. If it becomes a legal drug, I will simply adopt a role that nurtures me in the legalized marijuana culture.
1093	I've read the linked article. The short term effects of legalizing legalization could be devastating. The author suggests that the bigger long term effects will actually be positive. He asserts that marijuana use is presently banned, but this should be changed. He believes that instead of druggies and criminals developing new plants, they will be focusing on developing new things to do, as an example, smuggling countries should be able to override new laws. An increase in crime is something that should be decreased, not increased, because crime is a stumbling block in this country and many other countries. It should be decreased by more hours of productive work. In the long run, marijuana will save the country money, increase labor morale and productivity and be a good benefit to the economy.
1094	I don't support the legalization of recreational marijuana. Recreational marijuana legalization would lead to a spike in crime and a decrease in labor quality. Also, that would have no impact on prices. I've bought a whole variety of drugs, from alcohol to OxyContin. There's no real impact on any of them. With people smoking it and taking more of the stuff, you'll get a tainted supply and the original dangerous drug will get more popular, and that drug usage will lead to other dangerous drug use. For example, if the prices didn't go up for a few years, a constant supply of baking soda, which is the addictive substance from baking, wouldn't be as strong, but would be plenty strong enough to knock you out if it became available as a legal high.
1095	Be yourself. Learn through experience. Then you can be of service to others. Real progress requires both experiences as well as 'good stuff' such as education and lifelong learning. If you mean to help others, recognize that the real keys to your success is actually being humble and having real respect for people who aren't as successful as you.  Dress well for self-esteem.
1096	Even if you were constantly practicing the be yourself attitude, we wouldn't be very happy. We evolved from cavemen with a primitive brain the dawn of time in Africa, not a long time ago, and we're already becoming extinct.  It's all in the details. If I were perfectly in tune with nature, would I follow this advice? No.
1097	Many people are claiming to be themselves but they don't mean it at all. Sure, if you own up to not being great, it's understandable. A great deal of society's problems are rooted in arrogance and blind ideology. A person's character shouldn't be judged based on "but you know I was born that way". Most people will not care about those you make angry the most, and it is up to you to decide what you should do.
1098	I have given this all my life with all my best efforts and I feel very very inadequate. I still keep seeing smarter people than me, doing better things than me, better jobs than me, better houses than me, and I think about it and I keep feeling shitty. I'm a hopeless loser, the only thing in life I know is  how to be nice but that is my biggest problem with myself but I cannot do nothing about it so I just let it be. I choose to work with other people, both in a useful way or to show myself off, but mostly without thinking. And nobody needs me because I'm always supporting my self, I don't ever take advice or help from others because nobody's as stupid as I am. And that is my problem.
1099	Ask yourself this: What are you being built by? What is giving you strength and autonomy, confidence and self-respect? Does being the best fix what you used to be? Is perfection the answer to everything, as we have always been taught? Does the fact that you are paying attention to the ideals of those who are loosely categorized as social media stars to be admired by others make you feel good?
1100	We should research adding nuclear powered ships and space travel to the human race. These will help to correct many of the mental and emotional problems humans face today. These spaceships will be able to be used to break away from the psychological, political, and social issues people faced to allow them to travel and move freely throughout the world for better the education, the entertainment, and better material well-being, as well as better jobs and a more stable society. Technology is such a wide topic it is difficult to encompass in a single essay.
1101	That the idea of weapons of mass destruction is wrong is rather easy. The radiation the destruction creates would not be intense enough to damage any living things it strikes. Much of the radiation from space would be from the previously mentioned discharges. This is why the radiation levels in space are so much lower than on Earth. A typical nuclear bomb would destroy Earth within several months or a little more than a year of detonation. The other argument is exactly why they shouldn't be kept: not enough research has been done. This may not help with things we can actually care about, but the last time I looked it doesn't take space. Letting our technology fall into those hands could be the single most disaster in human history. A little targeted research is needed...
1102	But perhaps we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earths escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldnt burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1103	What a horrible idea! Hope that mankind does not crash their way to destruction in some subsequent event. Maybe instead we should better ourselves first and hopefully that would lead to a better environment - such as funding for public research into harvesting energy from water and wind, and teaching schools about environmentalism. We don't need this planet's resources as fast as we think we do and we can use tech, the internet, etc, to help us. Also spilling it into the sun would be a waste that would affect those living on the surface.
1104	I think we should put research into trashing it into the sun. It would become so hot and sticky that there would be no use for life on earth. Maybe it would incinerate to the point that we could predict the site and a few years in advance. Because it would be weakened as it left the atmosphere, it would punch through somewhere and land. It would smother and pull everything down. Otherwise a material such as titanium, alloyed with pure human scream, would be stronger than gossamer.....
1105	My football team is the one part of sports I really pay attention to because it happens at my school. I think that's the most rewarding part. I actually think my team deserved the money they got the year before they got told it would be increased by the school, even though the increased money was not used for school purposes. This is why I don't like the amount they're paid at sports teams. It may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given, given the current economic situation and what's going on in the world today.
1106	I wouldn't pay $80 million to Paul McCoy. He doesn't deserve the money he makes. He doesn't give a damn about equality or working for jobs. I would also make sure that if I'm going to pay them that I'm paying the same amount to anybody else that works in the same field. Also, he doesn't give a damn about what he will do with it. He wasn't there for the critics that saved his soul, and he doesn't expect thanks or praise.
1107	In the US we have what is known as "Fairness In Pay" for many different jobs. This in itself is something that can be weighed against the question of a bodybuilder working out to maintain their six-pack abs, doctors being paid many times more than teachers. An athletes' worth is ascertained by their history and their potential; an arms dealer makes a lot of money but has a poor history and no future. Teachers earn far less but have a greater cause. This is something that I consider when balancing the pros and cons.
1108	Sports make Americans believe that money doesn't matter. Whenever something good happens to them they will be the ones who take the credit and the praising, forgetting that their contribution comes from the help that others in society provide. Unless people stop striving for individual glory and focus on more positive things like coaching young athletes to prepare them for good careers. Meanwhile, the bills won't go away because this country doesn't work. This country has lost it's balance and we are now a country of the foreheads. Our future may come in the form of a different race going for white supremacy or we may see an outpouring of anger at people who are poor and struggling for a better life. America should be used as a force to bring the nations and people in the future together, not as a race from the past. And, I'm not bothered about the money anymore. I find joy when I see people in the community work hard to bring change to the world.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.
1109	I'm personally against the military and I'd suggest it really should not be ran with the notion that it's all for our country. Sportspersons, for the most part, earn most of their salary through multi-million dollar contracts. This mindset cannot be supported with what this country is given. Shouldn't the government put more emphasis on building infrastructure, providing services, etc.? Why can't the military focus on warfare when they are also responsible for the stress and rigors of fieldcraft, which will not be a major concern when a soldier is in the field?
1110	I've never had a hidden prejudice against Israel or being pro Israel. This is an honest statement of my opinion. So what if Ghana is anti Israel! Sports are competitive events played to win, and not to argue about concepts of fairness, superiority and inferiority. I'm not a football fanatic. As a athlete, I understand that it's important to play to your strengths. To me that means being prepared to take advantage of weaknesses in competition by changing the terms, if necessary. As a decent American I believe in the fundamental constitutional right of respect. Somebody said Nazi victories are annoying, correct? I've got a better than average...
1111	First, let me admit my biases: Ghana is my favourite competitor in # 2 Group G. Sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).
1112	Let me make myself clear: my team (USA) ranks second. It's just that Ghana, our team's opponent in the group, ranks first. I don't think we should be followed. The fact is that Ghana has scored four goals, each one against a top-ten ranked team. They can pull the plug on us in the second leg (which is the only match in group G). In other words, they have a very fair advantage, and it's important to level that. As it is, Team Ghana is ahead 1–1 in a 5–3 tie. My hope is that they will not beat us. In our case, the draw is preferable, and I believe my prediction was right, that our team will be the winner.
1113	All of the above. A group win should not trump a team win. It is a travesty that Ghana has the upper hand in terms of goals scored, while Team USA has the upper hand in goals earned or goal difference. And, yes, they have a head-to-head loss to Ghana, but when Ghana last played Team USA, Team USA had been knocked out of the competition for more than two years. My main concern is: what is most meaningful about sports? What should be reflected in a result?
1114	I don't actually deny that the other team's tactics were superior, but I still think it was Team A who did the best job for the tournament overall, simply by virtue of capturing the final point. that Ghana are a worthy contender to join the US soccer team. I still love to read about the World Cup and the United States football team. The field goal differential for team USA was four; Ghana's field goal differential was two. The fourth tied GBR for the #-# tiebreaker because it scored three goals and had only one conceded. I hope that the United States football team stays healthy and strong, so I could see you for one of your next one-day tournaments.
1115	I can't say I would blame all Americans for being carried away by the current war hysteria. People do seek solace through the media and like to give the easy blame to other countries. I'm not being completely morally sound here, but it's unlikely that I would be swayed from my position by American outrage. Still, this is a complex issue, and we shouldn't ignore it. I'm relieved that more families are not being wiped out. I like the fact that my daughter and grandson can attend college, and they're not so naive as to believe the vast array of propaganda that is being spread to children today.
1116	I have never contributed to the genocide of any country. I think war can be a source of many horrors, including the (lack) of a good education system. This is why I opposed the war in Iraq, and I will never support a war that involves genocide. The conflict in Iraq is being sold as freedom and democracy, but the war is a joke. The media hype and corruption are masking the truth behind the war. This war is neither based on morality nor law, or sound military sense.
1117	Conservatives have not removed military bases from the region. They support the wars. Do the F16s in Iraq have a higher return rate than those used in the border towns? Additionally, in most cases where conservatives have made statements or opinions they have been willing to go to jail. There is no free market in the Middle East where conservatives enjoys profits. As for the needs of refugees, so long as it isn't your children being blown to pieces, you probably don't even know how difficult that is. The people of Iraq that supported Saddam Hussein should have been allowed to decide for themselves if they wanted democracy and democracy just isn't about making money from Americans businesses. Therefore, I'm not sure about how helping refugees would increase welfare or any other major benefit to the U.S. The U.S. Navy is pulling out of the Mediterranean Sea as the European Union wants to impose the common currency on Greece. What kind of reason does that have other than ulterior motives, eh?...
1118	I found your post very inspiring, I agree with you wholeheartedly. I’m going to send you an email soon so we can communicate better on the common issues. Keep safe! .................................................................................... Have you ever thought about who you are as a person, how you see the world, and why do you do things like they are? After watching the piece you wrote, I am left with the thought, "we could all use more people like you."
1119	Growing to be more confident as a result of seeing the tides turn with such courage. As well as, seeing how America itself was able to wage war against Pakistan the very day after the 9/11 attacks. There was never a reason to delay it, but with the insistence of our leaders that was not possible. Again, I don’t see why we should be skeptical when our own parent are slowly disintegrating under our very eyes without a war being ever enacted on our homeland. I believe that no matter how bad the...
1120	That he is not experienced in oil spill management. But that doesn't mean he can't deal with the issues at hand, especially with a political backdrop. I am happy that he is bold enough to take the flak and to lead the charge in acting. In fact, I support that, as well. That BP was willing to shell out $1 billion to keep the problem from the justice system is not good, but I don't think that it was the fault of the oil company, because you simply take money and you have money. I also do not think that the banks went into federal funds futures because of the default from the bank of America. They had their personal interests to look at.
1121	Every business does the same thing where workers are being exploited. I agree with Mr. Bush's standards for a trial. BP must be held accountable for its misdeeds. As for politics and oil companies, well they have a longstanding relationship. I'm asking Mr. Sestak to work with me to get these people in line. I agree with him that he is not the one for office, but I respect his views.
1122	I enjoy his perspective on the oil spill and its impact on both Louisiana and the environment. He should have made better decisions as to who he was riding with and against during his time in office, and as to who to nominate to be Speaker of the House. I hope and think that Sestak will remain in the House of Representatives and lead the fight to get the proper attention for this problem and therefore fix it.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I really enjoyed listening to him and found him to be much more genuine than many politicians (including me) because I know he's going to be hardworking to deal with this issue. He doesn't get into so much talk with his biggest rivals, both from Louisiana and the people of the oil community, and this was evident because I saw many politicians talking and doing other things besides the huge job BP is left with helping the communities, so he truly is all about this.
1123	He was very informative. I appreciated the way he considered how the oil spill will affect BP. I do not think this is a problem with bad politics and oil companies. This was established much earlier than he was elected. Everyone has complained about corporate greed, but has ignored political action because of the CIA and deep state. That is what has allowed us to succumb to the current problems.   Added info   What to expect next  You will be given a more detailed task at a later stage of the assignment.
1124	I appreciate that the briefing session today covered the basics of how BP must, as an industry that operates in the deep sea, prepare for emergencies. In particular, he is right to criticize BP's actions in this particular crisis and criticizes his private association with the oil industry, which has been generally known to abuse public employees and even the environmental laws to push for particular interests. That was the case in Katrina. However, there are other issues with the Department of Interior that no mention has been made of, such as the 1 million...
1125	I see wrestling as a very important healthy sport. It has many health benefits. The real problem comes when you use unregulated proceeds to participate in wrestling matches. It is an invitation to illegal and terrible acts. I am also a big fan of Olympic-style events. Their venue makes it so peaceful and good for their image. Wrestling is a sport that I hope is the same no matter what you look for. However, it should not become marketed like others sports do. I find good food to be of the utmost importance, and I am a vegetarian and expect all others to do the same.
1126	We need to redefine Wrestling in the society we live in. We should encourage women and men to wrestle together as friends, rather than as opponents and competitors.  Who cares how good or bad you are? The bottom line is that we should be wrestling friends to celebrate friendship, not to win or get killed. The definition of Wrestling should never be any of these things, and no view from any other individual that is not part of the first two (2) can ever be acceptable or acceptable and valid in the light of the definition of Wrestling above. Thank you.
1127	I believe that the majority of things are unfair because of the inequality. There should be equal opportunity for everyone. Education is absolutely vital, as it is the cornerstone on which our lives are built. Communication is also vital, so that we can work together. How are we aware of what's going on in the world? Are we being bombarded with incessant news coverage of war? Where's the voice? that really showcases war?
1128	The WWE should work to find a better definition for ' Wrestling' and ensure that it's not about 'whipping someone like a switchblade' or beating someone down 'till they die.' The great and tragic loss of a kid's life was simply because a friend of the family always said 'if he does that you will get hired!' Wrestling should be an exciting, challenging and effortless sport. And if you want a card like WWE with tons of violence just go to a casino!
1129	I don't care if they are circled or not i don't watch television so  i don't know if that's what happened...Yes they are training.At the same time they are still hot and pretty and mostly drunk.A wrestler is trained to stay unharmed in order to win. They're just kids getting used to the spotlight - it's simply unrealistic to think of them as professional wrestlers.And how can you tell whether a wrestler is drunk or not? Yes...mostly drunk.
1130	I reject any form of feminism as a religion, and I reject capitalism...I support a government with a strong hand on the poor with free markets (The kind of thing capitalism isn't). I firmly believe in the bible and in the Holy Spirit and am not brought on here as a lightweight to preach to you, I am really prepared to sift through your conscience and really justify my point as an honest person. The Torah is Gods will for the world, I certainly agree with that. The free market was the free and open way the money moved, enabling people to benefit from that, while the democratic government controlled it. The feds took over the way in which all our schooling is run, and so we are left without the scholarship opportunities that a government run system does.
1131	Wealthy socialist desires peace, but Israel worships war. Those who worship the Torah are not bound by socialist ideas for "the betterment of humankind". Indeed, it makes for good propaganda that most religions claim the peace, prosperity, and peace of the Torah by their own definition. It has the same effect as saying: I plan to live my life for what people want, but I'm proud of what I believe in. It is plain to see that they don't realize how insulting and pompous it is.
1132	I live by one core principle, never be a slave to anybody or anything or to today's worn-out and outdated views of how the world is supposed to work, and as a Christian, try to think about it as such, not to put in context for my specific purposes, and at the same time tell the truth with any disadvantages as you did in order to inform.
1133	Most are attempting to censor free speech when online. My point is, go to the legislators as to your stance on religion and tell them that you are not ok with a president who wants to overturn the entire Torah/law base, and you will be put in jail for life unless there is a good reason you aren't calling them a liar, and the abuse you are subjected to online like most crazy haters you see cannot be compared to the abuse they are subjected to by the authorities.
1134	I am a progressive Christian/ Not even sure if its denomination matters. And after all, who is judging me? Im just asking for proof: No outright quotes please. If the Bible is true, or Jesus is not a lie, then all of the prophetic events foretold in the Bible had happend as of the writing of this in 1906.
1135	If you love tacos as much as we do, then you've definitely got to try the menudo we made for our annual Thanksgiving trip. This place is got a few tricks up its sleeve and their tacos...well it's a little below the standard but they do pack quite the punch. They should call it "el idioma de los dioses" because it lacks an elegant phrase to qualify it. That said, thank you for bringing back the classique taco we hadn't been here in a while.
1136	I could go on about the great food at Aqueduct. This place is exceptional. The best food we've had in a long time. Whenever we go on vacation to the U.S., we always want to stop in. We really do! As for dessert, it was no more tres leches, but I wasn't expecting it and I'm not complaining.
1137	Our dining experience here last night was blissful. We kicked back with six friends, good conversation, and a great meal and wine experience. I think to the best of my memory, the prix fixe was about $90-$100, but I don't think I'd be surprised to see it easily triple that. We couldn't let the evening end without trying dessert; even if I didn't think it was worth the money, I just couldn't leave after the enchiladas and rice without trying the oreo cheesecake. I sampled it and realised that it was really really good. Clearly refined and delicious. I love how they've gone the traditional route on here, but also incorporated modern touches that enhance the basic flavors. I definitely intend to return again, maybe every few months.
1138	Break out the Willy Wonka. This place is mmm the cutest, truest, julliest, slangest, rockinest, dustiest, leechiest, feel-goodest, sanest, slangest diner. When I make friends with them from different states, the only thing that is clear is that they want to go to Vegas and eat at this place. They actually manage to still enjoy the experience even more because the views are so sexy and the smells are so delicious. Even though Vegas isn't as far from here, it just can't seem right unless you want the French love. Spotted a man in a fancy white shirt running a table. Weird.
1139	Our last time there was back in April, just two months ago. It's great that they have a take-out place now, because I think our favorite part of the restaurant is the lunch buffet, which is mind-numbingly good. You have to go and try it:) There's so much you can order if you're hungry.  Chicken. On point. Beef. On fleek. Rice, beans, PLANTAINS? God, stop it.
1140	I believe that the author believes that India is not yet ready to lead the rest of the world. Many countries are economically more successful and intelligent than India. It is not yet understood how the technologies available in India can sustain India's massive population. The author is not directly criticizing the proficiency of India's people. Those countries are better equipped with technology, than India.
1141	Fair trade and free markets. India is one of the newest and fast developing countries in the world and also is very booming and developing as well as all the countries are. May be the future of the world belongs to the Indian and we can also say that India is the leader of the world.
1142	I would say the sentence “If the Indian nation could hold on” might be better. At the moment we don't know but hopefully in the future that might be the case, because not everybody should live like we live the majority of the time, people have to feel good about their own lives and that we should all work together and help the more poor and weaker people to be better off.
1143	I completely agree to what Vidya said in terms of investments. We are indeed moving on. Before the industrial revolution India was backward and could not sustain this much population on its own. I am sure that India is indeed making progress and surely in no time we will become developed enough to sustain many things ourselves.  However, I find it very funny that you promote education because you do not know the literacy rates and knowledge of economics in this country. The literacy rate in India is yet to figure. One in ten people are illiterate. In fact, we have not yet seen the best investment of our lives. I do not know why but it's something I never thought I was going to say but I feel lucky...
1144	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that this nation could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than this nation, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. In fact technology is one of the most sophisticated inventions ever created.
1145	I adhere to common sense. A father is someone that you can always trust. A father is someone who sacrifices his life for you and in return tries to make your life as easy as possible. It is unreasonable to expect a father to be a child protector. A simple apology to a child is not the same thing as a father. If a child can trust me and know that I can take care of him, then I have to take the child's life for him if it's necessary. I'd rather have no father then one that I cant even trust.
1146	A father is someone that is always their for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball and comes to all your baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting.
1147	I do not see the need for a father. I feel that a man should be his own man and should take a moral stand against injustice by taking his own life if necessary. There is no need for a father. This is my opinion and I respect the opinion of the other side. I would like to respectfully disagree, because society would never exist without a father. To illustrate, consider the Mahatma Gandhi and why he is considered to be a father figure. The other side says he showed exceptional courage when he stood up for his nation and his people. But I don't think so. I think the man was a coward, and never stood up for anyone if it made him look weak and maybe someone would have left him. My view is that a father is a man that takes responsibility, both as a person and as a man. I see the need for a father figure, but I don't think it is my father figure.
1148	I think that if you live by a strict religious belief, you have to go all the way and not return, or you are cheating yourself out of a chance to grow and learn. I think that if you live with a strict religious belief, that you set yourself apart from everybody, and you make a group of people to follow. People that do not believe in the same way do not follow you if you do. I believe you shouldn't live your life with a strict religious belief if you don't know how to give your all to anyone.
1149	Some all walks of life have bad people in it. You have to look under each one as well. It doesn't matter where or what you do, you're bound to meet a bad person sooner or later. You have to rely on self-control and awareness. You always have to take extra caution with strangers, unless you know who they are.
1150	Fatherhood is the most important aspect of life. I strongly believe you are better off getting married to the right man. If you can't that is not the point of the whole thing and you won't be happy and maybe a sad soul like me. I would prefer to be a celibate and not get married and raise kids with them and then what? The end of the world comes today
1151	I believe that a father is the person that creates a strong child because they will benefit more from a strong relationship with someone like that. There are so many wives out there that go through so much for their marriage and yet are still unloved, unappreciated and never come home on time. I would rather have my kids go without a father then to raise them with someone who treats you bad.
1152	I believe a father should do everything to raise children in a positive environment. A parent sets a good example for their child and a bad parent teaches your kids to be a bad person. A good father sets his kids a good example. If I were to get married, I would not want someone that was a lousy father for their kids.
1153	I think a father is more important than a husband, and I do not believe that having someone in your life that is lousy is useful. I have always believed in having a father for my children. He is who teaches the children good values, how to be responsible. A parent should be someone the child will call on in bad times and good. I do not think that without a father, someone else needs to make that choice. I would also consider a best friend to be more important than a husband.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I love trains, the bonds between the passengers and the train drivers were so much better than any airline. I love horses, the bond between the horse and the rider was deeper than that between man and man. I love peaceful, romantic long sighted people who respect their children, and make plans for the future. And I love the old trains that they still have still built by trains. If I ran into these trains and they were modern and not like previous
1154	The world is getting too interconnected for my liking. Nowadays people can get information from anywhere in the world and easily navigate from one country to another. This is not good for any of us, no matter what people believe. I would like to live in a state where we were allowed to control and manage our life. That should be possible to me. There should be no rules limiting choices for actions, as people should be free to do what they want. People should not go through life afraid or stifled, but free.
1155	Procrastination. I see this as one of society's biggest and most extreme damaging mental traits. Sometimes we want to procrastinate with something until later. Most people just think it's not important and all of a sudden things are falling through the cracks because of it. Widows are treated very poorly compared to divorced or unmarried women today. This is because most people regard widowhood as ruining the family's reputation. Wives don't get to retain what many women argue that they should because, 'it's tradition'. Most people consider infanticide a morally acceptable form of child birth control, especially during times of the...
1156	This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.
1157	Where is the humanity in all of this? Why have issues with rape, why is murder so common, the answer to this question is because we live in an increasingly saturated society and are unable to regulate this saturation. First of all there is the common defence that say "porn doesn't equal rape" although these celebrities who are sexualised on tv and in porn get starring roles they still commit rape. Secondly, to say that crimes "increase" seems quite self-contradictory. Are you honestly trying to say that there's a "damage" that porn has on people or is rather the result is that porn pushes people over the edge of sexual temptation? Porn doesn't reduce rape.
1158	Yes, it does seem that pornography is resulting in lower standards in morality. Today, many women, especially in the youth segment, are viewed as sex toys by men, and are forced to do an entire bodily pose for a row of trashy magazines and videos. This degrades how women are treated in society today. Whether a man respects his wife or girlfriend (to many men his wife/girlfriend is just a sex toy) all depends on how he feels toward her. Many couples are broken up due to disrespect, and fake perceptions about what a woman can and should be. This is in sharp contrast to the 1950's when women could vote in local elections and were judged by their own identity and not the identity of the male partner. These are just two of the examples that demonstrate how very detrimental it is to have porn in the world today. I believe that if the opinion of men were to be valued above their own personal feelings or giddiness, this issue would be a thing of the past.
1159	Men have always viewed women as sex tools. There are lot of men who still view women as sex toys. Also, in the past 3 years this is more pronounced with the help of Twitter and porn. This wastes a lot of time as it considers women merely sex toys. It also has its consequences as crime rates are high as a result.
1160	porn is wrong because it should be in 4-D with surround sound and special effects :) it would make it much more pleasurable btw im a girl..... but noh i don't like it none of this
1161	jarman: I'm a hacker i love beaturd and footstomp! i love i hate both :)
1162	jarman: i was reading about pron at a friend's house and i just realized that porn is really wrong and i dont know whats wrong with these people......
1163	Sex is plain wrong without sound effects and surrounds and special effects. And you need to understand that it is sex.<br /><br />That's why porn is just plain wrong. They are giving the message that sex is just fine and to have fun and enjoy...
1164	I dont get that one, im sorry :) xo bro'. porn is killing me. everything just sucks out there -.- its really getting to me!
1165	I think I would be a couch potato. poor education.
1166	if your constantly eating you will become fat.dont get lectured..u can get too big if u never exercise..
1167	I have been called many things before. Luckily I don't care!
1168	With no physical activity, there would be an increase in excess weight in the U.S. There would be greater rates of hypertension.
1169	a physical education classes of course must be taken in high schools.
1170	What - is God coming in 2000? He is not really. God is not going to come and judge the population on Earth in 2,000, according to religious scholars. The Bible does not mention that it is the year 2,000, so there is no need to be nervous about it. Why would God have to come in 2000? No one knows for sure. God did not come to earth last week, and then suddenly decide to come in the year 2000. Even before he wrote the bible, and gave these people permission to worship him. No, God never changes and will never change.
1171	Really? That's a better answer. Please don't let God come in the year 2100 to judge us anyhow. He's a fucking asshole. I've got a better answer: How could he be a "proper judge"? He's all-powerful. So what are we supposed to believe: Mary gave birth to Jesus at a time when her birthday was considered pretty early (perhaps in the late 3rd century or 4th century, or a few hundred years earlier, depending on how you want to figure it out, in the west)! I don't like using the word "proper", but I guess it comes with the job description for the subject.
1172	I believe in God. He is here to judge this world every 2000 years and start anew. Not if we started respecting nature, including going to visit an orgy and setting trees on fire. We all make mistakes. God wants us to fall in love with nature, maybe even to turn her into a parrot which he can talk back to. We humans are the problem.
1173	Well, I'd say that God doesn't have to judge us anytime soon. He created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then has continued to tweak them into humans for the past few thousand years. There are no signs that he's about to stop the evolution process.
1174	Jehovah's Witnesses believe that at the end of time, Jesus will return to Earth in a time machine, restoring all things to their original order of things, by God standing in the clouds judging how we lived during our lives on Earth. From what we have seen in recent history, that is an unlikely scenario. Jesus came to Earth to die, after an eternity spent in heaven for his own sins. He had no desire to come back to earth once his mission had been fulfilled.
1175	I choose to care about my surroundings and others around me. We all live together, and if you're too greedy and self-centered, you're simply taking up space. We all live together and by taking up space, you are shooting yourself in the foot.
1176	Every person alive should take this opportunity; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.  ### Input: Tell me your name and age. Here, here  ### Response: My name is David, I am 23
1177	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, everyone should take it. Choose personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.
1178	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse.
1179	I think it's the other way around! if you care about the people around you, you're selfish and self - serving. It's a shame that people are so shallow and narrow-minded. This huge, beautiful, cruel, almost god-like, planet earth belongs to all its occupants. We need each other more than we hate each other.
1180	I think the soldier uniform for separate from civil more in harmony with Iraq. Because terrorism increases social anxiety and group isolation.
1181	The terrorist think same way, but don't use to uniform for avoid attack, but for improve effectiveness. Meanwhile, terrorist not ignore law, even it's in conflict with national interest, for live in international.
1182	I am against separate student from others for at least increase garment job, as for how we can judge them. Although this way to advance technology. Because of how they are born and responsible for their actions. That also, since they are not responsible for their actions, we can go with soldier uniform to separate them from civil. Because terrorist maybe a good target.
1183	Students should separate from civil. Politicians will probably use soldier uniform because it's easy to protect soldiers. Militia can be deployed to areas that may cause political instability for the government. Militia should not use soldier uniform. Politicians are jealous of the military, because the military has superior weaponry. Militia members can be deployed to areas that may cause political instability for the government to avoid political consequences.
1184	A soldier uniform is for security, in order to solve terrorist. Soldier uniform is found in civil with a single purpose to fight terrorist only because at first they take place to separate civil.
1185	Having a good father makes me feel better. My father is super loving and goes above and beyond to make sure I and my siblings are okay. I make good choices because I know I will have someone to turn to when I'm all alone. Being a lousy father makes me feel better. It shows that I want to be good because I have someone to turn to when I need them.
1186	I believe that having a lousy father, like having a miserable mother or a poor uncle, as a minor child, is much better than having no father at all. This would allow you to be taught respect, kindness, hope, and the importance of family and the higher being. Having these lessons would allow you to grow up to be responsible. Having a good father would allow you to learn and put those lessons into practice, for the greater good of humanity, family, and of course, yourself, and then provide for your family and show them where true happiness is and what the world should be like. Having a bad father would allow you to grow up without lessons and without things to learn. That probably sounds like a bad point of view to everyone, but from my point of view that is worse because it would make my life that much
1187	I dont like social responsibility so I went to there by myself. what things are I more concerned about? money. so why would I go there? I dont want to be responsible for others or to say I'm doing it to learn responsibility.
1188	Even lousy fathers can change, most of the time they don't. They just need some push from you. In the case of the father, I have never had a chance to know him, so it is hard to say if I believe he has changed at all.
1189	I do not want a father. My mother raised me and she has done very well. When someone has done good for me and I am not worth anything to them it hurts. I have nothing and I just want to take from them to which they have always refused to.
1190	I don't have a lot of sympathy for the parents. I don't know the situation, but it seems fairly upsetting. Also, having someone who is unsupportive could negatively affect children's self-esteem, self-evaluation, self-esteem, etc. I do sympathize with kids who feel as though their parent doesnt love them because he puts things into perspective. Furthermore, if you and your dad would create a situation where you could be a little family friend and use the lazy benefits of having a father like that for yourself on a regular basis, it wouldn't hurt.   With all the mistakes you would do, he wouldn't even ask. He wouldn't even peep into your room and think you'll act poorly because he doesn't care. He would probably be pissed and wouldnt help you because he doesn't care, and he is apparently a typical parent.
1191	It's better to have a good father for practical reasons. You can blame everything you've done on your father. He cares about you so much he wants to stop using drugs, but gets a little afraid to tell you because he knows it will hurt you. He willnt use his favorite moment to tell you, because he is scared you'll think that he's a bully or you're doing stuff you've never done before. He always wants to be reassured because he wants his son to get everything he needs, so he'll tell you it's ok and he'll drop everything he's doing for you because he wants you to learn about life.
1192	It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think I need it. He wouldn't care so much that he'd get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.
1193	It's better to have a good father for practical reasons. You can count on him to keep an eye on your locker, to tidy up your room, and to check in on you. He still has no right to tell you why you broke the rule, or why you didn't put your work away. His remarks are harsh and unfair, but he doesn't hate you like a boss or a teacher or his dad. You wouldn't come up with a creative and unexpected way to anger a father, so why do you think he's trying to so?
1194	I am a much more responsible person than my dad. My job requires me to be accountable for everyone I have hired and the things I've asked them to do. I also believe that men should be judged by their deeds rather than their looks. Most men who get put in prison are held there for committing crimes of some kind, not merely because they look poor or even ugly.
1195	I think television is a good medium for informing viewers but I do not think it should be used as a replacement for good books. I advocate viewing documentaries in TV or on the internet and listening to informational podcasts on various subjects.
1196	In a democratic society, people in authority should try to draw links between government actions and unintended consequences. Public health and education are significantly affected by the government. It is extremely important to understand the impacts of these decisions to avoid consequential errors, however the government has poorly understood the impacts of its actions. The economy is much more complicated than people think as it involves mental work done by the human brain.
1197	I think TV is better if you are watching an informational channel, but it is better than books because you can switch to different informational channels, and you can search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning and you are ready to relax, you can change the channels and go to the funny show, what do you want.
1198	TV is important because there are educational information and entertaining information like comedy, history, shows, documentaries etc. You will be able to choose anything you want to watch, depending on what your interest is and what you want to learn about.
1199	I think television is the best media for children because it is easier for them to understand and watching an informational channel you can select from different programs such as movies, interviews, interviews, documentaries, music, and different other programs to watch for example if your kids are interested in music, you can also select music programmes.
1200	Government should not have to control issues like ethnicity, language, race, or religion because government doesn't have enough power to solve issues without hurting people and without becoming oppressive. Also people have to be responsible for their own self and others.
1201	Hateful ideologies do not attract me, but if someone wants to exchange his wisdom for me to listen so I will do that. Before all people can unite we must stop the war
1202	I don't agree with this statement and this happens often when my husband returns to Finland, we speak Italian and he often retires to Tuscan language or his favourite 'milkshake language' as he calls it - Spanish.
1203	Despite all of the language barriers that you face, some things are the same across all languages. Books are written in a language, which means that readers and writers are somewhere in the world and understand something is written. Readers read for the content, so they might not understand the written language. Our world is a truly global village.
1204	I believe in speaking a language naturally. Only when you want to explore another language should you speak another language. You should start when you are young to learn more about the world.
1205	Same sex marrage can couse a lot of contriverse, it puts peoples life at risk in extrem cases.However, it can also has benefits . Gay marrage has caused so much trouble. People have resulted in murder and suicide.
1206	I agree with same sex marriage, it allows couples to seek happiness and love without the uncertainty of barring from a prolonged divorce. I also reject the notion that homosexual people put families life at risk because domestic couples already make decisions and act on those they feel right for them, whoever they are.
1207	Same sex marrage can couse a lot of contriverse, it puts peoples life at risk in extrem cases. gay marrage has caused so much trouble in peoples lives. people have resulted in murder, suicide. people are not making their own economic decisions on their own when they enter into a marraige of any kind. that's why i believe the government should be that. the best way
1208	Same sex marriage is a right for every human being. There is no one who has the right to exclude people from the benefts of marriage because of their sexual preferences.
1209	I believe that same sex marriage is the strongest form of discrimination in society. Same sex marriage ends relationships and usually leads to violence, murder, suicide
1210	xxx country because of the conflicts they got based on religion,.they lost the footing of gains made due to their political development they lost a lot in terms of gain their nationality is simply questionable and their potens is not reallly there and there is no proper wrong in competing by the courage and committedness
1211	Indiana is the largest state in the United States and has the 26th biggest economy. The state is bordered by Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Michigan, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, whereas Michigan also borders Indiana.
1212	At first we feel hated towards india but to see the true nature of india by their success and development you will understand they will hate u the most if u follow their beliefs they have extreme religious beliefs they think u are a fool for not having their beliefs do u know that in this world an idiot think more than a great thinker
1213	if we are looking to contribute to development it means total freedom from warfare and injustice as well as equal opportunity for all people to excel in life . and we may not know the happiness provided by country named israel which is probably free from hatred towards palestinians but as we witness that much more hatred against christians from great gurus and religious leaders of india should we banate own country?
1214	i remember the only country by whose fear alexander's army was afraid: THAT IS INDIA.. after just sixty years of independence INDIA is looked as the country to become the sixth member of security council of UN and it is also the country with a great development rate…
1215	I am against murder in all its forms. However, I have always considered Jane to be mentally ill and would definetly turn her in. No matter what, she killed the dog, and that was the worst thing that could happen to me and anyone else. I would have to live scared in my own house because of her killing someone, and I do not want that kind of fear. It would be sad to lose my spouse, and knowing that she might get arrested as a result. However, there has been no confirmation, and at this point in time she might not ever turn herself in.
1216	This is a hard question. I'm afraid she would make me fearful. I wouldn't want to live in a world where people are killing. I would probably turn her in, if I knew her and she was a risk, not caring about herself, even if it was me.
1217	If this happened to you, we think that you would be very unfortunate. However, you still have the power to commit murder, and it is completely legal in the US. If you turn her in to the police, you could be severely arrested, and possibly jailed for a long time. But if you don't, your fear for her will only increase.
1218	If your spouse was actually crazy, a good place to start might be an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Once your spouse is stable enough, decide together if you really would want to leave her home and start over somewhere else. You might not stay married to someone who kills, and who has an alibi. Unless it is really some kind of emergency, and all your other options have been exhausted.
1219	I am very against murder and stealing. My spouse might be crazy and kill me if she wasn't around. So I would like to not be arrested either. So I prefer not to turn her in. Even when I do, I would be scared because it might be the last time I see her, or her family, as she could be deported into Russia soon. And she could also be transferred to another facility where there may be sick people or criminals. I don't believe there are sick people or criminals in Russia.
1220	I value my own personal growth, and I realize that every once in a while I should go for the personal pursuit to gain an insight into life's value and meaning, which was lacking for me. I try to come back to society to help others as much as possible, to lessen the suffering of my fellow human beings.
1221	I'm mostly a selfish person, but I am more concerned with improving the lives of others and making them better than I am with making myself better. I think it is better for people to focus on the here and the now and that they should leave this life as a better person who contributed in a way that can be summed up as living and serving other people even better than them did.
1222	I read The Procrustes Me and I loved it. I enjoyed that story because it's based on someone with Asperger's Syndrome, and it shows all of the different aspects of Asperger's Syndrome are a part of every individual, but that everyone is different. I've noticed how Asperger's Syndrome and OCD are similar things, you have a comfort zone and then you start pushing yourself out of that comfort zone. For me, I do have to push myself out of my comfort zone sometimes.
1223	I don't like military that much; in fact, I'd rather try to fix the electrical grid in my neighborhood. I don't mind trying to stop some of the warfare. It's a challenge and that's always good. Also, I'd be more proud if I could help the homeless in my neighborhood.
1224	I like being independent, though I have become one because of that situation I experienced and just because in some ways society can be a bit overwhelming. I am more likely to be selfish, to pursue a path that is short term, and to pick a path that is popular, but I generally just focus on me.
1225	Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945 which makes him DEAD. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006 Unless one of them can time travel its impossible for them to be the same a********.
1226	Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945, and he is DEAD. President Bush is alive and well in 2006. Unless one of them can time travel, it's impossible for them to be the same person. I may never get to level 4 by answering all these types of questions.
1227	Hitler didn't die in 1945, he committed suicide. This explains why his image has stuck in the minds of many. Both Hitler and Bush are alive at the same time. It is also improbable that they could both be the same person due to the many years difference in age.
1228	Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945, thus making him DEAD. President Bush is alive and well in 2006. Unless one of them can time travel, its impossible for them to be the same person. I understand about the different sh** part.
1229	Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945 which makes him dead. Bush is alive and well in the year 2006. Unless one of them can time travel, it's impossible for them to be the same person. I understand about the different ends. I may never get to level 4 by answering all these types of questions but it's starting to get less boring
1230	Marxism, not specific type, but deep left beliefs start at 5 years in prison.  It would then go to 10 years, with the possibility of additional time if additional factors are cited. You may expect some levels of community service. However, a true balance must be made.
1231	Use prior crimes. Someone for killing others should not be allowed to return to a society. They should be paid the full complement of time and do the drug rehabilitation program. More importantly, drugs should be illegal and need to be put out of the game.
1232	No more drugs, and no drug related crime. Consider putting together a jail term and drug rehab program. Period ends here. No more discussion on this topic, period. Withdraw the last word. No more discussion, period.
1233	It is a great proposal. The prior knowledge on the criminals is a huge concern, given the subjects engagement with  or traffic in illegal substances. That way, good behaviour will determine a smaller sentence. A prisoner will be able to rehab himself, and, as he was in the prison, he will do better here in the future. Three to five years is generous enough for prisoners, but I still believe in rehab as a program.
1234	I would not advocate for the use of drugs or alcohol. They bring long term consequences. A killing is considered a crime and should be a much longer sentence. I support the use of drugs for addiction counseling only.
1235	Lots of people take drugs.. some of them even use them to death but still others do not take drugs and are alright with themselves. If people want to be ill they must care for themselves and deal with the problem by getting treatment for their mental health issue. I'm not sure I agree with the statement of all offenders should be afforded no sympathy. I'm sure they take all of the background checks that exist, but even someone who is in the wrong could be easily mislead into thinking they are making a good choice for their life, but even if they have the 'fix', will this 'fix' actually work, I don't know for sure. It's good to have someone concerned about the effects drugs have on people's lives and give a sympathetic ear and also help them get the treatment they so desperately need.
1236	that depends..i lost a friend a year ago to drugs..very sad... no it has nothing to do with keeping the streets clean.. stopping white christians from killing black people in the streets...i use drugs because a lot of white christians kill black people and then use drugs to self medicate for the condition...dowry aacquire wealth.treated as inferiory...dowry means...unfair economic conditions in the world..the next generation is born into want......need a mental sick foundation.....they say if someone they hated got out the...
1237	Depends on what kind of drugs. I have friends who use a lot of prescription drugs and other people who use recreational drugs and some who don't. One can only be helped if they are willing to accept it. Just because someone else has been dealt with successfully, this does not mean you will turn a blind eye. No amount of sympathy will help. I would try and avoid drugs if I were you. The... session might help clarify issues not being present in your life that can be better understood through discussions.
1238	Thank You God (Faith) and the government is changing most religions made men perfect .even catholic gave birth to god himself.fanatic thoughts from a stupid coward let this be our foundation in action. people like myself that works hard to invest in social welfare of dishonourable state. we are entitled in our own land. we are asians but our blood not nailed down anymore. my brethern forever great. help us get justice for this.
1239	You are the authority and it is your land and homes and animals and people I do not believe but it is your call to decide you may as well, if you have a quick mind throw some education at someone else for their own good good, keep your land and animals and, Oh great nobody wants to hear about the fact that grown men should carry themselves better because you, you never even knew in case it's changed somehow, of any less I hate how my partner's job became, would take away some of the murderous side that is here in the parts of my brain that I still say I live here and so many people want to say to me, "Flesh and Leaves"
1240	It was the intention to get a job by claiming you had a congenital back injury. The truth is that the employer had also created a not worthwhile congenital back injury by not providing proper tools and putting a minimalist construction process on you. I would strongly recommend that all new workers are always provided with proper tools and proper construction processes in order to reduce the number of mistakes and accidents. A little knowledge is very dangerous in this day and age. When I decided to leave the job, I asked the admin how they could add up $200 to an already low wage job due to the low hours needed. They claimed that these were family and family obligations. In an era of slamming the door in a child's face, I strongly believe in protecting children and providing a family, as opposed to creating or providing wrong hours for profit. I wanted to compare this incident with the back injuries claimed by other students who were not
1241	I made no misrepresentation of any kind. I was misquoted by my employer. I was told that I was fired for misrepresenting the events of my previous employment. I was not blackballing myself. I resigned for personal reasons, and I felt that my insensitivity was a good indicator to my prior employer. I was never fired. I had been telecommuting. I was on vacation. In the beginning, I was not too upset, but over time, the days passed, the weekdays followed, and the month sped by. I was ready to move on, and I was encouraged by the outcome of my previous conversation with my lawyer. I decided that my employer was better off engaging in fair compensation, but I was determined not to let anyone foist this on me. I do not like the idea of using my private information or access to my tax records to damage my personal reputation. I was confident that my employer was well within his rights. I hired a lawyer. I had argued that the current...
1242	I strongly reject any form of Marxism. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred. I do not think that the world will change much. There have always been storms and wars, and there always will be, because human nature is flawed and selfish.
1243	Wrong. In this case, it might actually be important that you see a chiropractor. Before you continue, perhaps you should make sure that you did not injure yourself at work. If this is true, it is a good idea to see a chiropractor for corrective work. Although you may feel strongly that someone should be punished, in order to do so, you would need to provide evidence that the person was the one who caused the accident. If you had proof, then you could possibly start a lawsuit against the person involved. On the other hand, you could only start a lawsuit against the company. Your employer could argue that you were not the employee that caused the accident, but it was the company that actually had an employee who caused the accident.
1244	I understand the work rules very well but i still do what i want to do. there is no separation of work from home in the government and nor in any big companies. it is in all the small ones. i have an open mind on this and am willing to get a job and develop new skills to improve my odds which is why i took the time to update my resume. i want to change the world, yet am forced to fight for my survival every day at work and am not sure how to do it yet. u say you know when you are hired u put your job at risk but who in their right mind hires a drunken person u can tell just got off the drugs and wasting their time yet yes u take it as a personal attack. if all workers and employers would look at this and think about other's business practices u would not be here right now. unfortunately only management issues interest most people. just saying.
1245	Dear Friend: First, I would like to remove a small part of my answer. You quote a sentence from a book written by a supremacist white American, Hayek Korten in 2006: "I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish." His statements may be regarded as misrepresented, but don't make the mistake to assume that they are uncritically accepted by everyone who shares them. Hayek Korten, in a 2010 interview, highlights two contrasting statements about race: "In my opinion racial profiling is an extreme form of racism," he told the BBC. "There is a line between racism and profiling. profiling is an attempt to address society's ills, not a solution to them," he said. And "I do not believe that race can be eliminated. Not in England or in the United States. Racial profiling began in 1800s Britain as a way of enforcing slavery laws." Aside from the fact that Hayek Korten uses a '[f]ree market' defense for a polity he has strongly criticized for...
1246	No, you don't need more than basic knowledge. As to the discrepancy, insurance companies charge people off anything that makes them more likely to get into trouble. Insurance companies provide this protection by charging people more for coverage, for life and auto policies. As to racially profiling, it wasn't really profiling. One only believes race when profiling the first time and there's no number behind it. Let me repeat. Black people have more accidents than white people do. Everyone that's ever got hurt could claim racism.
1247	Dear Francesois, I am not familiar with the term "whitewash" in your country.  Something resembling the idea of racial profiling is arguably an unfair discrimination on the part of insurance companies.  However, there is no such thing as a single, all-encompassing, "welfare state" in the United States. Free-market economies have reasonable rules and regulations that regulate labor and other market issues. When you want to correct a discrepancy, you typically argue that there has to be more work, and fewer benefits.
1248	Dear Frances, Racial profiling has changed since many of those black people were living. You might have been younger, a little less bitchy, and aware that hatred goes in both directions in today's world. Black people are scammed at every turn.  Of course, handcuffing people and ruining their lives should be done infrequently and in far fewer instances, and for lesser crimes than others. But that remains true. Politicians turn everytime it suits them. What their doing, besides stomping on the Constitution, isn't matters.  If the evil politicians had all the cards, you'd think they would do their job more diligently than they do. And a disturbing number of citizen apathy is equal to desperation, that of equal deservingness before the law.
1249	Dear Francesois,  I am writing to you on behalf of Anti-Defamation League, and in response to an article you wrote about racial profiling.  We have sent you a  copy of the Anti-Defamation League's Position Statement on Racial Profiling.  It provides a thorough explanation of why racial profiling is bad policy and bad law.  It also lists four steps you can take to prevent racial profiling in your business.  First, contact the business sector you're trying to be involved in and report the discrimination; second, contact us, the Anti-Defamation League; third, work with us to develop a policy on  anti-racist values; and, lastly, bring this position statement to your customers and employees as a practical introduction to the topic of racial profiling.  It can be found here.
1250	I like to consider myself a free thinker, which makes me innately suspicious of many opinions and individuals, such as politicians and people in religious positions of power. Unfortunately, on the Internet, the power is often held by those who believe that all the world needs to do is convince the individual that their opinion is the right one. While we should be open-minded when deciding on what the opinions of others are, we shouldn't blindly believe them until proven otherwise, no matter how convincing they might seem.
1251	If you're going to read from a news article, I would suggest you look into the origin of the information. The source of any news article should be good enough to validate the information. Having said that, you could still be misinformed, so it's important to put evidence and source in your written answers to prevent misunderstanding. The same applies to books! Having stated that, it also gives you the opportunity to turn away from false information found in books and post facts of other sources to the questioner.
1252	My point is that we need to be careful that we don't believe everything that we see on the internet. I'm a true neutralist, meaning that I believe that no source is more believable than the others. We should consider everything that we are presented with and try to figure out what is real, and what is not. I don't agree with those who believe that our behavior can be affected by our trusted resources, namely social media. We are our own worst enemies and should trust ourselves and not someone that we have no physical connection to.
1253	As others have mentioned, we have long been under attack from the left and the right. This was true with the science wars and it will be again when we move into the post information age. Fortunately, I have no biases against newspapers or television because I have experienced both. I understand the need to have someone hold accountable those people spreading disinformation, as was said. In the end, it shouldn't really be about whether an article is truthful or not. It is about whether it is information.
1254	I am a true neutralist. I believe any written communications by whoever they are can be taken as their view. And they have the right to that view, no matter what. There should be no extra load on the individual just because of the way they are expressing it. A message to propagandists, or anyone in general: don't make these assumptions based on the available proof. Otherwise, people will get confused. Grave consequences might happen, such as left-wing black propaganda on fascism of people believing black people weren't rightfully colonized because of the lies written by other people who are in the same realm.
1255	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that probably their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but it doesn't matter. That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said I don't want to see statistic about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how are they actually discriminated.

I want facts about how are they actually discriminated.
1257	I'm an offputting individual. I am not racist I don't give a damn about the color of your skin. However, you as white people think you are better than other races. It is nonsense you live in the same country and not take any power back from people who abused your minority status. Also, because most of you think your race is not discriminated in the U.S. you think its ok to force our minorities to do their jobs in factories. By the way, when was the last time you saw a white man on a factory floor before you cry racism. And you shouldn't because equal pay will be more plausible if you learn to respect other races. Instead, you should be thankful because the world belongs to people who are different from your race.
1258	I believe that black people have their constitutional rights protected by the state. Having worked for a long time in the legal field, I don't see anything that could damage the well being of the country if they were treated equally. Same with other minorities. States are laws that have been passed by the government which give everyone equal rights to the land. Most of those states have been passed centuries ago. I also see nothing wrong with a certain amount of discrimination. All we need is a decent level of equality. Black people don't have to take the blame for their background, discrimination is a natural part of the human experience.  PCS. Sorry for my grammar
1259	For example blacks in the us have the same rights as any other person. The only difference is that they are considered second class citizens simply because of what the state believes about what blacks do (criminality rate). The main problem is not black people themselves. The problem is the low literacy rate and poor education they get. But these issues need to be faced, they're actually the main reason why blacks are discriminated against.
1260	Over the last few years, I have become more and more critical of how Fox News presents news. I have, however, since developed a new relationship to the network and, on the whole, find that their reporting remains interesting and entertaining. The problems of Fox News were listed earlier, including their attempts to block their viewers from their programs, as well as bias.
1261	I like Fox News, and believe that they are the best media outlet. Fox News is an example of the low of media broadcasting. I enjoy all major news organizations, but Fox is a great place to become informed. Fox, NPR, and the TED conference all have a consistently great balance of conservative and liberal voices. They all highlight ideas that generally attract dissent for either side. I feel like Fox is the best channel to find out what conservative ideas are, and dismiss liberal ideas as they are simply not conservative in nature. It is impossible for me to have a liberal opinion on something, like the media portrayal of the terrorist attacks in New York or the Iraq War, or that it is not just Islamic extremists who hate America. I know that I am closer to the truth on those things if I read conservative news, but...
1262	Fox News is a flawed news outlet, but they are clearly not the lowest of the low. If you look at the bible, you can learn much and all these things including insights about human rights, and rights for women. Also many of the bible teachings in books are copied in college textbooks. If you have reason to think that the world will end one day (the laws of nature, such as entropy) I would still advise you to talk to your team...
1263	Fox News is an exceptionally biased news agency. They hold a lot of wrong ideas. I like the opinions of the authors, such as Buffet and Clinton, and do not want to be cut off from their views. That is why I feel that I should remain neutral. Fox News holds bad opinions and I will remain neutral. I support the opinion of Buffet and Clinton and want to learn more from them.
1264	Though I am still skeptical of Fox News, I would not recommend these views on the site. I would not advise you to see Fox News, but may be to find some things that you feel are important. I would recommend staying away from it, instead. Then, you will still get the news, but from a different perspective. I would not recommend you watching them, because they are biased, and I would not encourage you to think differently on political issues because of it.
1265	President Obama should not have another term because he is not an historical figure, he is a man from the present. In fact, there's no one better qualified to lead the country than Mitt Romney, who already has a fantastic record in public service. Mitt Romney would reverse many of the promises Obama has broken, such as repealing Obamacare, removing the inflated social security benefits, halting the increase in the minimum wage, lowering the income tax rates, investing in technology and...
1266	It is rare to find someone with the correct answers who don't know something. I've read their comment several times, not able to find any sense of logic. Let's say you gave a good advice, your are certain that the world will end one day, due to the laws of nature, namely entropy. That doesn't make it a good way of living, but that doesn't make you the enemy of man. To tell you the truth, I don't like Obama, and I support free markets, because he only wants his own personal advantage, by encouraging unpaid labor. However, he's trying to protect American workers, so you should be aware of his intent. It may confuse and frustrate you.
1267	I see what you mean, but I wouldn't necessarily call Obama a bad leader. I've met and spoken with a number of leaders who were far worse than Obama is. I find as a matter of fact, that Obama is one of the few modern leaders who wasn't really a leader. Like people see the brutal, uncaring battles of the 19th century when looking at our history, but fails to see the contributions, not to mention the brutality.
1268	We can confidently predict the failure of a leader who has not even finished his term yet based on the quarter of 1 percentage of the leaders of the United States of America in history. President Obama has not even finished his term yet, so I am unable to compare him to any other leaders. I assure you that there have been at least 5-10 former leaders who were worse than President Obama is.
1269	The world should clearly improve upon Obama's performance. There are many reasons to be a fan of Obama. Not only has he been the first African-American president, he also revolutionized foreign policy, including a unique approach to control illegal immigration and fighting terrorism. Furthermore, he has built a strong economy and expanded social programs, significantly improved our national security.
1270	Violence is caused by social values. It's a societal condition. Society promotes individualism and makes people think of themselves and their desires. The news makes society angry and leads people to distrust each other, and we condone this. Mass advertising manipulates all our emotions to make us feel inferior, which is the way we see ourselves. Maybe it would be different if our media did more in a helpful way, promoting balance, unity, and of course equality, and better human understanding. Now society wants people to be constantly suffering, rather than just having periods of happiness, but people can't really change their minds, and this is why we hate more and more. We live in a world where people continue to kill themselves, and less and less people are becoming aware of the wrong of our society. The solution might be better education, perhaps to change the way we think, not lead us to become hypocritical hypocrites.
1271	Violence is perpetuated by society as it makes us feel upset with our lives, we are frustrated and feel like things we can't afford - movies are full of lives we'll never live. This leads to depression, which takes us from happy and content to upset and angry at daily life. This causes people to kill themselves or someone else.  It takes a lot of focus to drive someone to kill other people. This is why fewer suicides happen in small farming communities. This is because people there feel closer to others and as a result safer, and are happy and more content.
1272	Violence, poverty, and myopia are caused by society, by social circumstances and media programming. A person shouldn't kill herself for not having a mansion in a gated community, nor should they be afraid to live in a gated community if they are above the heads of the average family. Social circumstances are not true or deadening, but happen to all of us. We would all be better off living and being happy in a gated community if that's what we were creating. However, if you had died in the gated community surrounded by a better society with a better school system, a decent road system, a better health care system, and a better peace, you would have been more successful than many of the people who actually live in these gated communities. It would not be forever; it would be because you were better off than you would have been on the outside.
1273	Violence is perpetuated and caused by the advertisements for things we don't want that get into our heads. Society brings with it a distrust of each other. The news puts us in mind to deal with each other like things to get our goods instead of people. To illustrate why every video game is innocent of a trigger for violence, here is what TV programming does: when most TV programming is death and destruction through violence and guns, suicide in farming communities is higher than in cities and less murders are found in farming communities. The less guns there are the less crime there is. That's because people in a village are closer together in that one world, are better settled into the...
1274	TV programming, particularly violent programming, has a large impact on society. Strong individuals who are capable of asserting themselves will find a better understanding of the inner workings of society through the bible. Negativity, violence, and pettiness can encourage suicide. TV programming and advertising are relatively less prevalent in small farming communities, and for that reason the rate of murders and suicide is lower. People in small farming communities are less likely to commit crimes because they value their own life and relationships with each other and do not fear exposure to a community of strangers. They are also more likely to form bonds with the community. Negative programming may encourage violence and sadism.
1275	"Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious "war" in history." The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same *number* of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war. Solve the number discrepancy of people killed using the "misery index." Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
1276	"Believe me, these are troubling times in the world. To me personally, I find comfort in the fact that true faith in a good deity can ultimately bring peace and comfort. The freedom I have in my life in part comes from my belief in a higher power than myself. The peaceful solutions to most of the problems we face does not come from religion but from studying the Bible and sincerely believing in a good, holy God."
1277	In some ways the current world situation is much worse than anything that might be included in the bible. Many people die because governments decide policies that cause them to neglect every detail that might contribute to their survival. Man is such a selfish, cruel, primitive little guy that I believe that he is much better off with the animals around him and a dwarfed garden full of destructive plants than we should ever settle for a...
1278	I believe that religion has caused massive human suffering over the past 2000 years. In fact, I believe that it is still doing so, and the wars between religions will continue to happen. I don't want to see society divided further by religion and take the place of a peaceful, and meaningful world, therefore I promote pluralism, including the dilution of Christianity. Furthermore, the population is always growing, and unregulated migration will worsen the problem, not help it. As such, my position is to reduce this migration, and in the end to make natural family alliances permanent.
1279	"Finally, more people have died at the hands of government than any form of religious "war" in history. The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same *number* of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war."" A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
1280	This place is really bad and I will never go there again. The owner, their staff was rude, unbelieving and very unprofessional. She makes a bad employee smell like a human being, but it seems that they're hired for the customer service side of things more than people skills.
1281	I have just been robbed by a bunch of strangers who have made fun of me on the elevator, for being a disabled person. Poor people skills from the owner and his staff. Don't do business here.
1282	We walked in to the website calling University Park Inn and thought there were open seats here, but as there were not, we thought the manager would know that. Also the people skills level were very poor. As you can see the manager took this horrible experience as her own.
1283	This was a rude experience. Our wait was way too long. The children were sound asleep in the seats, and the heat and the entire experience was chaotic. We also read everyones review where they would write how great this place was and then wrote a terrible review. The only person who seemed stressed was the woman at the front of the line.
1284	We went elsewhere, too busy to complain and tried a normal place. I did not take offence when the guy addressed me as 'your line'. My response would have been to say that I always will not be done using this line until my work is finished with my appointment. The staff was a bit scary with the young lady manager, i want to ensure they aren't on the street shooting!
1285	The food is delicious. I also think it is very convenient with limited parking lot. Rolled Ice Cream next to Hwaro is also really good. I hope to visit there as well. It was a great experience and while I usually go for rice bibimbap, this time I had the fried rice and great soup.
1286	I love Korean food, especially Korean BBQ, so I'll end by telling you that the only thing I didn't love about this restaurant is there were no gyoza. Despite this, I just got to eat my way through this delicious buffet after my lunch. I'm probably going to come back again tomorrow after work, and I might recommend it to my friends.
1287	I love Korean BBQ. When I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll go to Rolled Ice Cream after, and if my friends have extra room in their stomachs, I will go to Gen and Hwaro. I've had gyoza before but I like to go Korean BBQ more. I always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is good too, and there are a lot of sides! Also the steamed egg is always good, when cooled down.
1288	By the way, I have never had the opportunity to try the ice cream. This is supposed to be the Korean BBQ restaurant closest to Gen and Hwaro. I love the Korean BBQ but don't often taste the beer they have. If I am in the area, I'll probably head there for the food and again weave a side trip to Rolled Ice Cream.
1289	I appreciate her take on Korean food. I can live with gyoza not being available, as long as there are a lot of side dishes. I'd love to try gyoza in the future. She suggested the Korean BBQ that she's loved eating and also advised that we go to Rolled Ice Cream after. I'll keep looking up this brand to see if it is going somewhere, though.
1290	After a year i have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review i have tried many different foods and always find them being my favorite compared to anywhere else. Every time i go here i am greeted by courteous employees and they remember me every time. I have had nice conversations with Steven, begging him to open a store in Peterborough so i can enjoy the food more often. Some of the foods i would recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice, and the Goat Curry. There are so many other delicious selections though. If you are looking for something different or just looking for a new spot to eat i highly recommend The Zen.
1291	The food and the service are by far my absolute favorite place to go. i would highly recommend the place to anyone with any appetite.  Although having been there for more than a year i have eaten at a few other places and just would never be able to compare the food and service to The Zen.  i could write a lot more if you wanted me to but i really do not think this needs to be a review.  i really do feel the need to be brief.
1292	The Zen is a great restaurant. Their good food and outstanding service keep me coming back. The price of course, is a little steep for me, but whatever, it's good food. I was really pleased with the chicken pakora and the pad thai. I am definitely going to be back. I would give 5 stars if I could, but I'm just not so goddamn rich yet. I'm so impressed with the service I got at The Zen's my dining experience today that you can hardly express it in words. I hope they keep up the good work.

1295	I do n't like to wear uniform because I want to express my individuality.
1296	I think it is bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look unatrel.
1297	I wear uniform at school because my parents decided so, and i like it.
1298	I strongly disagree with school uniforms for children. They lock children in and lock out their natural and sometimes creative nature. They diminish the power of the individual and the creativity and critical thinking that comes along with their emotions and thoughts. I strongly encourage that children wear clothes that express
1299	I wear a lot of religious clothing because I believe in religious discipline. I am not a total conservative I have other values in life. And a uniform does not express anyone enough as he wants to portray. Also in our local school there was a campaign to stop the wearing of
1300	I agree with the tv because it can help you learn more instead of watching too much tv. besides books are much cheaper as the tv licence isn't and if you could pay for one, you'd be glad as a book could teach you more than a tv show.
1301	Correct tv  can't change brains and it has a lot of bad effects on kids without effect on major and you can't control your misbehaviors without it but a good book can help you a lot
1302	I have a better thing to do than watching tv. Books can help you learn more so you can have a higher knowledge and better practice. I'll prefer to read a book than to watch a TV program.
1303	if you would like to be a war person then go for it... use your violence on whoever you please but books are better.they can teach you anything and everything...and in this world everything starts from a school.
1304	There are many books which can be bought for cheap in the bookstore. Books can help you learn much better than watching TV. Books are not only less expensive but they can also help you learn more effectively and can help you understand what they cover better and may also better your knowledge of the world and its problems. Books are well better than TV because they are cheaper to buy a book. Television licenses are expensive to buy and they are not always right for kids.
1305	On the other hand, we can not talk of "India will lead the world" because "India is not able to lead itself".India has a high literacy rate with 60%.It has become a full fledged democracy and its economy is second largest but people don't live in a conducive environment.India suffers from internal violence and foreign and domestic military conflicts.
1306	France needs immigration law. France has contributed nothing to the history of world civilization. On one hand, Spain, the second most powerful country, has supported Indonesia's unique work on human rights and development, which has been very welcomed by the international community for its contributions. On the other hand, Sweden has done nothing for the progress of morality of Europe and international humanitarianism. France suffers a decline in wealth. The balance of power between the western countries and the former Soviet Union has always been fluctuating, and France has suffered from this for a long time. Today, Germany is also calling for "a further adjustment of the balance of power."
1307	India is the most populous country in the world. India's ranking has been dropping due to sanitation issues, malnutrition, poverty, and the massive population. India would not be the world's leading country if the country does not have confidence in itself. If India is not improving, with all of these statistics, then it is unlikely that India will lead the world.
1308	India is trying to catch up with itself. But with a heavy load of illiteracy and castes, the chances of catching up are slim. India needs confidence to bridge the gap between its future and today. Only then will India have enough positive changes in its way to reach the top. Focus more on education and policies, and you will see signs of growth soon.
1309	1.India is much more into ideological applications and has a poor understanding of basic concepts required to run a society. After all, most Indians are not well-educated, so it may be said that they may not be able to handle the future or may not want to handle it at all. They may find meaning or purpose in some of these ideologies, but often, they simply see them as means to get things done.2. India may not wish to handle the future as it does not have a sense of self-confidence or integrity. Most Indians are more concerned about things that are not important to them--perhaps a type of corruption or power. They do not feel like citizens of a country and may want to skip the formalities of what makes the country what it is, such as owning an education.
1310	then children had everything they needed. now they have to go to lockers. they got money in order to buy their things, and they pay school fees. children have got a little bit of responsibility, but not much. maybe they need better people around them, and better teachers.
1311	in the past, the candy store was full, but now the store is empty, which a result of addictions such as pornography.
1312	This information is very disturbing. needless to say, we need to do something to stop child pornography. one way is to get social workers closer to students, to prevent problem behavior from going unnoticed. internet pornography has caused a great deal of harm to our community, in so many ways.
1313	now children are bound to police and teachers in every way imaginable. even boys and girls may receive a t-shirt saying saying: "Female liberation." girls who want to become actresses or police officers should wear t-shirts stating: "boy or girl be free." a free society needs open minds, open hearts, open eyes. we should look at all sides of a question, ask ourselves questions to think, and listen to other people in the
1314	child pornographers and sexual predators are a result of parents failing to monitor their children. technology opened the doors to new crimes, such as child porn and sexual predators online, who now prey on children and women. technology is an important tool that makes the world more advanced, and using technology is to be encouraged.
1315	I embrace this radical philosophy and believe that this is the only way forward. I want every human being to become transcendental, discovering their truth and their god. I
1316	I am an evolutionist. I am a creationist, however, and I reject the notion that the earth is billions of years old. I support both the scientific research

1319	I argue that it is wrong to assume that humans were created by God. I also believe that man had a distinct role to play in the evolution of the world, as
1320	Scientists have studied dog breeds, and are confident that humans do not resemble dog breeds anymore. As a science student, that proves humans have not evolved
1321	It seems humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history.
1322	Yes, humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history. Humans have improved from the pre-human primate ancestors, but beyond that, there is no
1323	Wow! this reply is from someone who believes that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history
1324	They have. I have been writing this essay to demonstrate the undeniably ridiculous nature of science.
1325	Perhaps evolutionary theory was off the mark and life just didn't go that way. Technology will probably make it happen more slowly than we think. Claiming that technology has caused evolution to halted may be harsh criticism of people who faith in technology. The only theory in the scientific method that examines all of evolution's past without judging it by today's society is Mendelian inheritance. As for "mimicry," if you know what it is, the following video shows its proof: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpMe3hvnW4g
1326	The earth changed before the marine habitat. Overall evolution did not occur while humans emerged on the earth. Once a species evolved that didn't work for humans it went extinct. The "missing link" was the emergence of the human race. As soon as the endothermic technology was discovered humans' brains' lateral expansion resumed.
1327	Not only that it doesn't make sense but also shows poor thinking. It is observed that our so called "post-generation's brain has a deficit in DNA replication because of 'age related merisma and psuedo-aging that impedes DNA repair pathways." Evolution in itself is basically a property of life that we observe in our surroundings. It has happened in the past and it will continue to happen in the future. Here we are as we write, enjoying our privilege of genetic inheritance and without any need for evolution in the genetic sense (i.e. there are genes without protein products). There are genes without protein products because the 'photosynthesis dictates the rules of amino acid sequence itself and takes care of the formation of protein in a very logical way without the use of this 'piec
1328	Nowhere in biology is evolution supposed to happen. It happens in a messy - and random - way. There is no point in trying to scientifically explain the few remaining biological creatures that somehow appear to be missing all of the features that make them unique and special members of their species.
1329	i think evolution has stopped because man is the only intelligent being on the face of the planet and he has started to understand it's existence and won't live forever as he has the capability to make climate change alter nature so humans can never live in that world again and to live a lot longer.
1330	I applaud the efforts of porn producers for creating a niche which exists between artistic depiction of sex and the power of pornography to influence society. I tend to agree with the position of the narrator as he completely loses his nerve about social aspects of adult entertainment. All in all, the narrator has a lot of things to protest, but ultimately he's not sure that
1331	A man should be judged for his character, not his genitalia. Women have sexual preferences, just as they have preferences for other things, like career fields, and it is not the concern of the bible to discuss their choices.
1332	Everyone has their own desires. Those who want to work as actors are fine with being degraded by pornography as they have their choice in the matter.
1333	Everyone has the right to choose whether or not they want to be in pornography and the subject does not revolve around choice.
1334	It's their choice to be in pornography. They don't have to choose it. It's their life to live, and they're entitled to do so without being harmed. This sentence uses words in italics, rather than a bullet point.
1335	Porn may or may not be sinful, but is a morally wrong action, regardless of who may or may not believe it to be sinful. You are free to believe it is sinful or not. But it does not make it correct. I don't believe God is against porn.
1336	Pornography is aesthetically pleasing. We will just make reasoned and logical decisions. If it doesn't make you feel better in the moment, don't do it. But if it makes you feel good, don't be ashamed to do it.
1337	We have to look at the whole thing. The bible describes pornography as sexual perversion and an offense to God.
1338	We will always have sin because human nature is sinful. Many people do not question the truth of the bible, so we need to. The bible does not contain the word "porn" so we do not know if it is in the bible.
1339	I do not believe that the Bible is meant to judge people for who they are or what they do. Rather, I believe that a person should be judged by their actions. I disagree with the idea that certain forms of media, such as pornography, are inherently "wrong." Additionally, I believe that when such violence is perpetrated on women, there is generally either a step-by-step abuse process that leads up to
1340	Advancing the common good is better because like the Bible says, "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes without the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
1341	Advancing the common good is better than football because even with the player defects it still works and works well, Football is a team sport, like a football team doesn't need quarterback, lineman, and receiver that doesn't believe in one another so it doesn't work. It also undermines the independence and ambition of an individual, because anyone in one position has to work for the other and that's where it breaks down.
1342	Advancing the common good is better because as the Bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport. They all have to believe in each other. They have to lean on each other to be great. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
1343	Four Kings is better because KINGS PROCEED IN THE HAND OF THE LORD ! the great and terrible JAH is upon all mankind. Let the foundation be humble and the heaven may stand upon it. Let there be between you peace, peace against all injury. Let the sinners turn unto JAH. @palin We truly need you with us.
1344	It is better to advance the common good than to use the bible as a tool to advance my own agenda. For example, I do not think that Red Bull fuel make footballers better athletes. Football is a team sport, instead of believing in and supporting only yourself, as well as your teammates. It would help a lot if we could all come together as a team instead of competing against each other and trying to be better than each other.
1345	I am in favor of climate change, pro-choice, and campaign against smoking. I am against guns, prefacing reasons I oppose guns for. This matter is highly contentious and I am a person that is not anti-gun. however, I strongly view a gun control. However, I am for fighting against voter ID, especially in rural areas where crimes are being committed by armed voters. As for the second question about uniforms, I would be up for uniforms only if they're in harmony with the other school principles. Uniforms should be based on age group, sport and the legislated requirements.
1346	Those arguments are well stated.  Whether school dress affects kids behavior, though I cannot say, because children do not always behave well around peers as they mature to the point where they dress differently. however, the main point is that it can, and has, reduced children's dress to the point that the school dress enforces uniform wear rather than letting the students decide what they wear.  Others in my opinion said that this was necessary to encourage uniform wear, but with today's technology and kids that just do not seem to want to dress up so much I have to say with 10 years experience I believe this may not be necessary.
1347	1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear whatever they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms 2. Okay Look school is for learning not how you look and dress but maybe in some levels it matters and most people that go to schools that don't have uniforms take about 1 hr just to find their pants or shirt I mean really??? When you have a uniform it takes less than 10 min just to take it out and put it on and
1348	I'm not sure if you're talking about the clothing or the uniform. 1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms 2. Even when you have a school that doesn't have uniforms  it is ridiculous that childs have to go around finding a nice pair of pants so that they feel equal then attend school. This seems better to me as well.
1349	On the one hand, it makes everyone feel equal (if we all can wear whatever we want, some kids will get teased to their peers and feel that they are lower than them in groups) and gives them different types of things to be proud of than friends who look alike and wear the same thing. On the other hand, we waste time and it takes us an hour to change clothes (as well as to get changed back if that matters).
1350	No school uniform. At least I don't think one is required. All it takes is a little imagination, a bit of character, and a pinch of self expression!
1351	Wear your choice of clothes, whatever you wear you can be one of the most fashionable people in the world.
1352	I won't give up on my own personal style. I always go in a little bit more style than I think most people would.
1353	No. Our clothing comes from the pig, and they grow in free range conditions with special certification. This means you're less likely to hurt those you live with or to have toxic chemicals in your clothing and skin. So use your problem solving skills and wear what looks good on you!
1354	You do not need to wear a particular school uniform just wear something comfortable and cute
1355	I like watching tv with my family because I enjoy being a part of a family, and it's a good time. Also, I enjoy watching tv with

1363	The author of the text actually wrote a comment on the ndians' long history which is quite interesting.
1364	I believe that Indian culture has always been powerful. I am confident that India will continue to regain its ancient glory and will rise above our fears.  We all

1366	Like criminals need to go to jail and learn right from wrong they need to know how to be responsible. I believe if kids were treated like adults they would be better off than being locked up in a playground setting and failing when they get locked in the
1367	I generally don't say that, but if the worker needs training or direction they should get it. That's how you get things done. But you shouldn't put too much pressure on them, or they will probably slip.
1368	Teenagers need schooling because it helps them understand that they get hit with consequences.
1369	I value education. Our children should be educated so they can hold an honest job in the future, which could mean becoming a criminal.
1370	As a Christian, I think there is a definite spiritual direction in religion. In that way, I find it easier to understand man. I appreciate that all people are simply individuals. For my own faith, I would not encourage followers to over reach as a leader, to see if it makes me look like a hero. Still, I think faiths provide a need for guidance and help those who are down on their luck.
1371	Christianity does not strive to promote better morals and ethics. I find the ideals that atheism preaches repulsive. I deem atheism unorthodox, false and contrary to the teachings of Christ.   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: The book of Revelation was written by John and hence is inspired by God and has only one source of truth. The Day of the Lord, the last judgement, will happen very soon, according to Revelation. Even though it will happen with relative ease to non-believers, it will be particularly difficult and difficult for unrepentant believers. Therefore, it is up to each
1372	Christians live in morality, and an atheist lives anarchy, or without moral boundaries. There is no more justification for atheism than ignorance and wrong judgement, those with a lack of moral judgement are not entitled to have a better life and never have to worry about bad things happening to them.  Without morals and ethics, how do they know better? I do not believe atheists have values to encourage better behaviour to improve their lifestyle. There is absolutely no real difference between Christians and atheists. I do not believe that atheism is better than Christianity.
1373	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For a ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.
1374	Freedom of choice and liberty make a world more tolerant and less fragmented. We are not all like one another and there are things we can stand to disagree on. But none of that changes the fact that theocracy brings down countries and religion brings down people.
1375	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you could give your child. A slap makes a child more mature, doesn't make him/her grow.
1376	I think if we are being forced to punish any child, then punishment is a waste of time.

1379	There are different punishments that you could give your child. No child should get hit.
1380	Addressing the paper submission of others, I suggest that the student be lenient with the paper assignment. With concerns about censorship and privacy, it would be easy to falsify online. Instead, he should focus more on the quality and content of the dissertation, which must be done in a timely manner. If the student is unable to do so, he should still be fair with his fellow students.
1381	Politican tends to be office seekers, but on general newsstands one doesn't see such proposals because the rules are too complicated.

1383	Good argument, but it would be a long essay to write and I'd need extra details. You need to make more about the reading, as well as what the classes covered would be like. Also, you need to explain why you feel this was an interesting passage. But overall, it's a good point and I'd like to see how your rewriting goes!
1384	Although I strongly believe in affirmative action, I am not in favor of making it illegal to discriminate against gay people. I believe that a person should be judged by who he is, not by his skin color, religion, or ability to pay for school. As a liberal democrat, I support equal access to education. I do not support the status quo, although if conservative libertarians really want to change things, fine, but they should first admit that they are totally wrong. I strongly support fighting for gay rights and equal employment opportunities.
1385	I strongly believe in giving to causes and that should be a part of everyones view on how we buy things. That should be an option and not a set of rules. Plus I think that it's a form of gratitude.
1386	I hope you find what you're looking for with your donations. The world's not what it's made up to be. I agree. Please consider donating your spare change to the causes mentioned in this text, and let the world be a better place.

REWRITING TO INCLUDE WORKING EXAMPLE The world would get better if Christians did what Jesus of Nazareth prayed for the poor and needy all the days of his life.  But they are busy with soccer games, speed-diving, dancing, and swearing.
1388	If you're serious about donating, maybe think about donating to a worthy cause. I hope you find what you're looking for. I do not support the donation of my material things, so I will not be able to donate.
1389	Hi there, I'm looking for a way to help the less fortunate in my life.  There's a lot of money to be made in the animal, natural world, climate change, petroleum, sewage and water dumping industries.  Rebuttal of Love What You Can Buy: Spread awareness about these issues.
1390	Re: You're up against a criminal who is out of control. you're legally innocent until proven guilty, so unless your up against high-profile serial killers or terrorists or people with guns, you're in a lot of trouble. I think the loopholes in court lead criminals to do even more wrong because i can guarantee you that if you commit a crime, its hard to prove that you committed that crime because unless you know a thing, they can prove that you committed that crime and get you convicted. So by taking someone into custody, or tried in court, your pulling one over on the state
1391	Well , I would say to err is human ! Maybe if u are under XXXX . Stop the horrible activity and  take out your XXXX NOW ! Hope this helps! I have sent it to u on VIM and sent it to my email immediately as well .... Just wondering what type of change you would be asking for .

Then she saw the dangler from across the gap she couldn't get to, how could she walk back. Eventually she came to a decision and decided to jump back to safety. As she jumped her boyfriend grabbed her arm to stop her from jumping.
1392	I did not break any law. All I want is some respect from my people. Just give me an opening to voice my opinion. Please take me into custody. I would be very happy to respond to any questions, might be able to get you on the air. Even if it's just once or twice a week. At least I'll know I'm not being punished for my views. I'm not trying to stir any trouble, if you truly care about me then you'll allow me to speak and give my views.
1393	I agree with what is in the documentary. The Catholic Church does violate human rights as it focuses on a religion over the welfare of the countries people who live in it. The Catholic Church uses the CENSORSHIP system on people who oppose or do not like that religion. In the Catholic Church, too many priests abuse the people they are supposed to protect. I think it's important to know that even if you don't believe in God, he still has a sense of responsibility. And my biggest worry about the Catholic Church and Church Streting is that they use the CENSORSHIP system. They could use their power to control the dissemination of certain information on the internet, rather than a responsibility to DO GOOD WORK. I am a strong believer in the Censorship of the Catholic Church, because it is not a voluntary decision for the Catholic Church to take part in the censorship, nor is it a promise. The Catholic Church, in this case, willingly entered into this censorship arrangement, the Church Stretch, and it was basically done with the knowledge of the Pope and the bishops, and is now being carried out with the knowledge of current bishops.
1394	I loved every single thing that you said.   This idea of taking someone under oath and denying an accusation that they committed a crime is a terrible idea.   Of course we know that he is innocent.   If anybody was caught or considered guilty of a crime then there would be no mercy.   ......................... What you should be doing is thinking about the following questions....    Who would be the judge in the situation?...   The person that the accused are supposed to be...for instance in this situation the accused is Jonathan Taylor... Who was Jonathan Taylor married to... an innocent being married to a murderer... are these being realities... without any questions asked...let's be honest...   who was Adam Landau married to... an innocent being married to a murderer...are these being realities...without any questions asked... let's be honest... who's pa lewis... What is the definition of Infamy?...no meaning to me...
1395	I think the best way to go about things would be for people to stop actually paying taxes and start pushing their money over to the government after already paying for everything. I have found, however, that once you start shifting that money to the government, not to mention the private organisations such as U.S. schools and hospitals, many people start justifying the tax based services that are the basic cost to having a good government. They aren't thinking about how the government, themselves, peruse the money. I think that's why so much of the criticism of government services end up falling on private citizens. And I question the effectiveness and efficiency of this system, and the good things the money needs to be spent on are simply not kept by the government. For example, how can anyone really know what the extent of whether the U.S. is a democracy, when they are the most member of the population that actually sits in a congress?
1396	We are expected to pay taxes in every country throughout the world, or we would be poor. And the idea that other countries should find ways to tax or control Americans is not logical. Only individual countries are ever allowed to do this. An individual country should not be able to do this to the individuals on their own country's soil.  ### Instruction: Write a short paragraph that meets all of the requirements. The following is the dialogue that is going to be the body of a brief, 30-60 sentence news report. Question: Your nonprofit set up to help make books with do-dads, sells them for 75 cents a piece. What do you think?
1397	Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish
1398	Here is a good example of a task that can be created with this method. An employee is forced to pay taxes on his or her wages each year, but only gets a partial refund on his or her taxes each year. He or she also has to pay on any credit card debts, expenses, or other items that have not been deducted from his or her wages. The customer may find this confusing and decided to consult an expert.
1399	I strongly believe that taxes are one of the most stupid things ever designed by man, and that's not an exaggeration. Please lower taxes, so I can pay less in the first place. And then I'll take a vacation while I'm paying less to save money!
1400	Go to your attorney right now. You will probably get much less for a divorce than $170000 even if your hopes for a financial windfall are high. Even an attorney who has spent years in law school would not charge $30,000 for a divorce. You should also bring a divorce settlement. A divorce settlement will allow you to kill your divorce fee by not bringing it up again. If it can be shown that your husband's sexual
1401	As mentioned in your email I would recommend that you consult a lawyer. I would go with someone who has experience in bankruptcy and unsecured debt issues. Such as someone who has worked for you or someone who is familiar with handling debtors such as yours.   I would also consider withholding payment to him until his fees have been paid. I would recommend a filing with a regulatory authority such as the IRS if you can't resolve the matter with him. A Request For Assistance In Debt Collections is available online on the IRS website
1402	If you really want to go to the council you could hire a cheap attorney to take care of the public defender thing but it would be more cost effective to go up against him directly. His fees are usually 25% to 40%, depending on the state so it can only be cheaper if you want to fight for the legal fee itself. You will have to go into his personal accounts and come up with $17,000 in money. You probably have insurance so you will have to decide whether you need it for uninsured motorist, if you don't have it the car company probably won't compensate you much and if you do have it and you...
1403	Because you state that you have medical bills, I am assuming you probably do not have any personal medical insurance. In this case you can find a lawyer who specializes in personal injury, who can work to recover some of the money you've lost. You can look up these attorneys on the website www.Law Firms Near Me and look for some reviews or ask a family member or friend who has had a similar experience.
1404	Your odds of getting anything going with this guy are not good, with a lawyer involved. It is very probable your lawyer will sue him and, although the odds of a verdict would be in your favor, you would still lose substantial money. He might be able to garnish your wages (charging you half or more of them), possibly collect the... None of this was for this assignment.
1405	GM spoke out against the war in Iraq. He is a hero, not a rogue spy. He is a whistleblower. He should be greeted like a hero, not thrown out of Iraq. Even his threat for critics to get fired is absurd. If GM were to leave GM I imagine his job would be filled by a group of former paycheck politicians. See http://www.discover.com/2007/01/20/is-luis-ada-apologizing-for-seriously-leaving-american-a-google-hijacked-flagship
1406	I would be embarrassed if my secrets leaked. So they should not leak. Leak what you want, the question is how do they want to get it. I strongly believe that dissidents and whistleblowers are moral transgressors. Globalisation got us into this mess. Now should they all be hung on a flagpole like pets? It got us into this mess, they brought us here. their troubles before the end and you tell him you want to help him take care of the children
1407	When Geraldino had access to the Defense Department's American battle plans for Baghdad and he decided to publish what he got in the bay (it being secret he didn't care if he cost lives), he should have been sanctioned and not put on trial. He's the same guy who got thrown out of Iraq for speaking out in the face of the West's bid for regime change in Iraq. Geraldino has given up anything less than fairness and journalistic integrity. So while reporters are fine to get news without being covered up by bias and censorship, they also need to be accountable for what they are publishing and are not free from the consequences.
1408	A. Geraldo didn't get thrown out of the military B. Geraldo didn't get thrown out of the military A. Geraldo didn't get thrown out of the military C.

1409	I've got you covered. But you need to know this much. Saudi Arabia obtained a court order against the al-Jazeera (the signal from which was strong in my home state of Washington) and ordered al-Jazeera to close down.  Those policies are harmful to me, US and the people of US. I probably wouldn't be able to watch the Olympics if those events aired at a time when al-Jazeera was on.
1410	The threat of divorce is good. It brings people together, which is good, as long as the marriage is still a good match.  Otherwise, it is bad, because there are often good couples who end up being unhappy, or not having children, or not sharing property in order to get what they wanted instead of what was right.  This often happens.  This is often a...
1411	I'm against large corporations buying into property in California, and possibly in the country as a whole. The legalization of Marriage is, in fact, unhelpful, as other countries are not undertaking this act.  The legalization of Marriage is, in fact, unhelpful, as other countries are not undertaking this act. Certain countries, such as the Philippines, allow marriage between people of differing ethnicities, creeds, religions, and sexual orientations, if you want to put it another way, you can, but it is within the bounds of morals. That is fine with me.
1412	I would eliminate the per-person costs of marriage and eliminate marriage itself. It is already many years since people have died childless. It is men with no regard for their family who rule the world, and so killing and raping women is an insult to women themselves.  Men who do not respect their own family base their status, including their success, upon their mate's sacrifice. I hate the idea of paying taxes. Are we any less of a civilization or a set of people than what the top 2% have founded?
1413	In the modern world, time for marriage to be about having a loving relationship between a man and a woman is declining. Marriage is now for mostly the financial and insurance benefits of it. There is no middle ground in today's society in terms of the goals of marriage, with more couples getting divorced. Planned families, the lifelong tradition for families, are becoming more rare. I believe marriage shouldn't be about the financial and insurance benefits, and it shouldn't do anything for a woman other than protect her interests. That should be enough for us to start thinking of marriage as a public policy and not a social document.
1414	I believe marriage is a business, and a license with the intended purpose of protecting the interests of women in any way possible, and helping raise children. I understand that both parties should be mutually committed. I don't believe in premarital sex, however I support marriage for all causes, including raising children. I don't believe that things should be cheap, so if you want to go shopping with your husband, or see your kids, you shouldn't pay much, just make sure that you have a job or are saving money.
1415	Mark Owens:'flogging’ is, on the face of it, as unfair as Capital Punishment, both laws that actively punish a person without the possibility of a chance of a trial in a civil court. On top of that, the flogging is extreme and cruel. Justice and foresight are required to understand that if ever both criminal and victims rights were violated, the boundaries between them should be respected. Otherwise, modern day oppression is still very much alive. Flogging, rather than Capital Punishment, is a barbaric punishment and it therefore lacks the concept of fairness.
1416	I do not believe that abortion should be legalized because of cost and because of the philosophy of "it is the right thing to do". The term gestation does not exist when the foetus dies before it is born. However, I believe that a woman should have the right to give birth to her child in her own time and place as best she sees fit.   You do not believe in abortion but do believe in the right to live.  ### instruction: At present the majority of the world does not respect you because they don't know about your reasons. What is your reasoning for your actions? Why does abortion make you mad. What is the likelihood that abortion will be legally legal in your society?
1417	Disagree with using capital punishment, but believe that life begins at conception and should be treated as a right, not a privilege and that any society that values the value of a human life should promote nonviolent solutions. Furthermore, I'm disheartened that there are organizations that hide behind the claim of religious beliefs.
1418	Answer not in context No. I believe a person should be judged solely by their own merits, not their character or their race. There is no reason for people to be executed or disenfranchised. As such, I don’t favor capital punishment and flogging. All citizens should be treated fairly, and nations should be able to rely on just justice, not on other people’s opinions.
1419	SOCIAL JUSTICE Is the best thing to establish in a society. It is also something that is hard to define precisely.  There is no universal principle of social justice. Universal principles of justice at one point are just about the personal interpretation of each society. They should be consistent however  with the values that an individual believes in, and to expect that some areas of the world where people enjoy life above others could be treated unfairly, could be seen as perverse.
1420	I don't think "nalism" translates into stupidity. While I understand it's history, I also understand that it's constantly linked to sounding stupid. I wish we could learn from it instead of preaching it, but it's all a part of our history. As to being African-American, it wasn't intentional; I was just not able to understand the difference between "think" and "techn" and thought it was spelling something else or something that is particular to Black culture.
1421	I believe not my "NI9Af my brother" day should be every day. I think its stupid though. I  think part of being  black is saying it when we are not feeling said word. It would make me love being black that much more. I think that the definition of "corny" or silly doesn't really matter. It is words to me. I have used it in a scenario once in my life though and i always correct myself.
1422	A way to tell people that you are black is if you cut the "r" off the word, just like a lot of people. The word is not "neither, neither, neither." Its not offensive and it shouldn't be offensive. Black people don't feel they should use the word when they are with white people because it makes them look like its offensive, and they feel embarrassed about being black and using the word. And it really isn't. I think most people just don't know how to say it. I believe the word is actually undegraded in its real context and its pronunciation should not be changed.
1423	I believe in black people, and I support them being free to say a letter is heard the way that they choose. I think that the black community needs to be empowered and that should be for their own benefit, not because of a fear of the word. I take issue with the idea that saying it with an "a" and saying ith with an "er" is any form of degradation, since most black people do cut it off, while white people don't. Many people in the black community are intelligent and able individuals that can form an opinion and have a voice. I support the black community's rights, and I believe in allowing black people to use words that people in the black community have chosen for themselves. I'm constantly hearing people say to me, "You're talking a lot", or "Give yourself a break", or "You're a better black than me", and I say "How about I am a better person than you, I just wanted to talk, but it's not worth the hate of you. I'm sorry that I have to carry on the conversation, but I refuse to give you an argument that you refuse to hear".
1424	In other words, I hates anything close to racism, in any form. I tend to prefer to have a light voice whenever I am around others, even my own people, so that everything is clear and everyone is not insulted. Also, I have no interest in fighting against the current structures, because they are very immature. At the moment it is an ineffective struggle to raise consciousness within these systems. I believe the best answer is to change these as little as possible, allowing for time to resolve.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.
1425	In my opinion, the bomb threat is a low priority. When a bomb goes off, I run to my car and get out of the school. I know where my car is and its safe to leave. I also save my life instead of waiting until the bomb squad comes. How are you supposed to carry a school bomb (off campus) while others are unknowingly paying their taxes to cover the cost of your false alerts?
1426	I can not recommend running to your car because you risk getting grabbed and shot for abandoning your school, no matter how many times that someone is looking over your shoulder today. The reality is that if the school had never placed your safety and well-being so high up on their plate, you wouldn't have ever been allowed to go off campus.
1427	My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat the entire school must pile up in our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad come. However a smart terrorist (or whomever) could easily find this out (every school does the same and says it on our website) and plant a bomb in said stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to just run to my car (off campus) and escape. Its worth saving my life 100% of the time. Our school tells us whether or not we have a drill that day or not so I would know if its a legitimate threat.
1428	I feel that if there is a bomb threat at school, I would prefer to run to my car and escape off campus rather than staying in our school stadium waiting for police or bomb squad to arrive. This is the correct way to save your life. I know that there is always a risk, but it is still better than the risk of being killed in the school stadium.
1429	The National Football League tends to have a steady financial model. The NFL contracts teams, and the teams work together to create a revenue stream. Like the NFL, every sports league does what the NFL does. Without the NFL, professional baseball and professional soccer would have to adapt. College football would also have to adapt, and so would its corporate sponsorship model. Instead of printing money, printing dollars would make me less trusting of politicians.
1430	But of course, I obviously work for one of those most exciting teams in sports and don't really care about what the top two teams look like.  ### Instruction: Below is a request for a short response, and the corresponding input. Note that the work is expected to be free content and should not harm any reputation. You are not required to like or support the buyout firm, just to be honest and complete the task to show readability and honesty.  ### Response: Big pharma profits coming from drug addicts are billions of dollars every year. Nobody is dying as a result, even though they are very addicted. And the packers are struggling with drugs within their organization.
1431	Because I think... I think there is already parity in sports. Every single league has more or less the same amount of teams as there are cities within that league. And those teams also wrestle for the same amount of revenue. And the team with the best fan base always wins championships. It doesn't matter how great or little money they have. I think we are already living in a sporting equivalent of nirvana. If true parity existed, I'd totally prefer it over this. I'd choose to live in times where every football player could be famous worldwide before any other professional sport player.
1432	I don't think that anybody cares.  This is simply an incredibly stupid sentiment that is only going to get worse. Parity isn't about "whether a championship can truly be considered the best, it is about what the overall playing field looks like." Everyone has to at some point be afraid of being put in competition with Miami Heat. Fans watch to experience greatness, not to destroy it, and they can easily find that on all sides of the Atlantic.
1433	Even if parity would occur, if the top two teams did equally good and lost the same amount of games, they would still have a massive advantage over the rest of the league. The whole idea behind parity was about having the most balanced competition possible, and that ended in a few clubs being able to prevent the other clubs from achieving dominance through seasons and seasons of receiving fits to the point of exhaustion.  Changing professional leagues to mirror every other league to provide parity is a bad idea. With real parity being between the best two teams, the rest of the teams become weakened by having to compete in equal increments with two of their best rivals. This allows only two clubs to dominate the competition, and without dominating the competition there is no reason to watch.
1434	There has been a lot of discussion about parity, probably too much, in sports. In particular, there have been many attempts to create a so-called "basketball league" where the top two teams in every sports league would compete. As the two-year ban on baseball's name-changing scandal shows, you do not want to see two bad teams name themselves Great Republic of Texas, and play a championship game during their regular season. These teams could possibly call themselves Greater Dillards, specifically to capitalize on the metaphorical influx of cheap labor that underlies this discussion. I would oppose the creation of any such league, because I don't see a benefit. While one can certainly decide for oneself what level of parity to prefer, I see a benefit in men's football at the college level, especially when understanding the current state of men's football in general.
1435	I believe that humankind has become part of nature and that we could create more sentient lifeforms in the same image as humanity. However these lifeforms should have their own culture and race with their own languages and customs. I also believe that they should have their own attributes and charisma so that they would not be equal to humans, if sentient lifeforms were created. They should have their own culture to draw from and draw upon their specific tendencies to their advantage and allow them to grow. It is my belief that humankind's nature is greater than nature itself and that everything we do is part of nature.
1436	We humans are not like animals, instead, it is believed we are just an extension of all living things. I believe that if we could create an effective copy of a living being, it would not be equal to us without the same abilities. We as humans are capable of creating another sentient being, without a problem. I believe that the races would go extinct if it was not for God our creator. Therefore, all of this is just a theory.
1437	I support free markets, market economies, and ideal capitalist economies. I believe that the market should promote goods and services which improve quality of life and should bar politically motivated monopolies. I do not believe that it is justified to burden an arbitrary few on the top with a government that imposes taxes and burdens the middle class while promoting goods that clearly do not provide value to such a burdened class.
1438	If we were to create an intelligent life that had achieved the same goals and capabilities as us, then in my opinion it would still be inferior to us. It could not possibly be our equal. It was meant to serve as another life form. But in the end, if we wanted to make things perfect and almost in perfection, that would only make us feel better about ourselves, which for me is a shame and a...
1439	Man is not equal to God in terms of his creativity. This is based on the fact that we as human beings are completely artificial beings of our creator God, and not part of his natural creation, for example, as are animals, fish, and bacteria. And if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, then it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us.
1440	Trapper was a complete nut. Drinking too much. Traveling too much. Food poisoning must have run through his veins. He claims to be an elected MD. He has no time for the army, or worse yet, sick. How can he be not a vet? You just have to ask Hawkeye. He's only taking medications because he's not well. He lied on his resume, got his license, and went on to practice as a doctor.
1441	Went to college, then went to see the band support Billy Joel at your office. Had fun with all the people there and practicing scissor kicks. Rode bikes/electronica, opened up to UBC. Been in VA for 40 years, never ran out of things to do.
1442	I call BJ Trapper John. He is not a doctor, but his "professional" work has been serving the Hawkeye patients in a big way. When the war ended, he returned to U.S to pick up the pieces and aid the nations that lost brave sons, including Hawkeye.
1443	With each passing day, the comradeship between Hawkeye and Peg had thinned out. If you were one of the Bears you could have a fan club, but as you saw from their postings online, they just wanted to be by each other. The contrast was maybe partly explained by his far more savvy comrade, say the same thing about his wife.
1444	Trapper, boozing it up with the Second coming on the horizon, enjoyed his hot rod, mohawk, and rock-n-roll under the stars while BJ was happy to be back at the front of the warfare. Hell, he even had happy thoughts about his sister---not only the tag team that's forever together.
1445	There are many trivial things to debate about, such as spelling. For example, my wife and I have argued in the past about how "real" airlines may increase total cost without reducing their profit margin. I've also agreed with the argument that companies are free to travel upon their own terms. In other words, someone can see pay for only the time required to travel and the expenses generated by the trip. For an example of that, let's say someone is going to New York for a one day trip and decides to stay a night in New York and another night in Boston. The very long flight requires a two day stay in Miami for at the very least. Should the Miami stay cost be charged to the traveler? Nope. The costs should be deducted from the return ticket. This also just goes to show that the likes of airlines and big banks should never be regulated, as regulators charge them for doing little good service. Similarly, any kind of regulation should be avoided. Taxes, we all know, eventually go back up. As for misspellings. Nowadays, people are using spell checkers as...
1446	I like to wallow in nostalgia...since most of my life has been away from the "mainstream"... I am amazed at how controversial even small things, such as spelling mistakes, can be...well, when said by people who claimed to be knowledgeable and/or powerful...ever wonder why people who claim to be educated hate civics classes?...
1447	I agree with 50%. Based on that, I consider the best course of action to simply refrain from such debates as a contributor, and leave others to resolve their difference, as they see fit. One should try not to engage in such debates if at all possible, as arguing over the issues can become very heated and unproductive for everyone involved.
1448	I think this the worst of it. I am all for faster time, and all kinds of development. The internet is a wonderful invention...why is it so important to have those kind of arguments that are passed around? I'm sure a higher performance computer and faster internet speeds would be much appreciated, instead of spending a lot of time on trivial matters.
1449	I apologize for any errors of either spelling or grammar. The posting on that debate of my name called me ignorantly, probably because I am black and have a Spanish name that is not officially translated. But...I have heard the most ridiculous criticism from associates at home...especially from people who are little more than natives. As I write this my heart aches.
1450	Jon Stewart does have a better grasp on current events. He stays focused on the important issues. He also has more points for being there first. Stephen also has an interesting style, but does seem to not understand that he's not always and immediately recognized. The insulting attitude he projects on his Twitter is annoying and slaggy.
1451	He writes about a lot more important issues, and they tend to stick out. He always seems to have great interviews, probably due to being really good at knowing his guests and the things they care about. He also has very good reporters he interviews in the show. Good interviewers know how to ask good questions. Stephen doesn't do that. Stephen's arrogance is difficult to dismiss.
1452	Jon Stewart has a much better sense of comedy than Stephen Colbert. He covers social issues with wit instead of sarcasm, and has a much better sense of comedy than Stephen. For example, his New Yorker correspondent has much to say. John Hodgkinson has always been one of the best special reporters, but they usually don't bring much new information to the blog, so I think you should look elsewhere for information.
1453	It's hard to make a joke on yourself so it's the best you can do. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have a much more sophisticated humour style. Both have great interviews and the special reporters they have are great too.
1454	I think Stewart has the best humour style and tends to cover the most important issues. His interviews are always great, his reporters are brilliant and the specialists he works with always have great questions. I don't like Stephen's arrogant act and his jokes are often not that funny.
1455	I think you should try Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. It is consistently decent. It was always pretty nice with an outdoor Terrasse in the summer. It was a nice bite to eat after a long day at Jardin des Plantes in the fall.
1456	Personally, I love Jardin Panos. It's just your typical Greek restaurant on comida griega style, a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth, so it's not that special. But it's super lively, and its terasse as far as I can tell is more of a summer spot rather than a winter one. The food is inconsistent. In a world of mystery meats, Panos will provide mediocre food every time you visit. But the outdoor Terrasse is quite nice.
1457	Panos is an outstanding restaurant, with excellent food. For $26.00, all you get is a platter of lamb skewers, a chorizo burger, salad, and fries. One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at for that price. I've also had great experience with Maria & Terence here. I frequent the mediterranean style restaurant a bit more than the Greek, but come as often as I can. It's also why I happened to come here, and it shows. You will have a grueling time fitting the 10 dollar tip into the tip jar if you just pay for the food, but either make sure that your party gets everything, or want to give as little as you want. It truly is a rip-off what they charge for service.
1458	I like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. But I get the feeling that at a certain point, Jardin Panos will become a standard looking, grocery store-like decoration. It's just like that after, you know, a few years of the same thing.
1459	I really like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. If you're looking for a rustic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, with the regular salad and rice, and an entrée of tzaziki, go ahead. Try it! The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time. What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse. It's very cute. Like for a lot of people in the area, this is more of a summer destination rather than a middle of winter spot.
1460	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution, you can see the animals creeping closer together, smaller and smaller animals until we get to what we see today. If you look closely you can see breadcrumbs, when an animal dies you will see bits of the frame of this living animal on a piece of twig or something in the mud.  ### Instruction:  Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument
1461	Evolution, I think that is pretty obvious. You can see it in sponges, in fish, in fruit flies. Different species come about because of mutations and they win because of being better adaptors and that is evolution. You can even see it in living things... people age and fall down and there is yet another reason. There are examples everywhere in nature.
1462	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution happen.
1463	They seem to be insects , except for their wings . There seems to be a substance called DNA. They can reproduce by laying eggs and can switch between men and women in a fairly short period of time. You could even talk to them. They have pretty long tails that can hang in different positions
1464	You can see evolution really happen in the real world. You can actually see evolution happen in the real world. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution happen.
1465	Marriage is about families and relationships. It has also been the cornerstone of society for centuries. I have found love between my dog and two kids at the local middle school, as well as my husband.
1466	I think marriage should focus on families, generations, example and commitment. I think that love, passion and courage aren't enough to make a marriage work. There should be physical commitment, as well. I think that there's no "correct" time to marry, once you have reached adulthood.
1467	Marriage should be based on and reflect a compromise and respect for traditional forms of family unit. In modern society, marriage has been hijacked and has become about none of the above. In ancient Egypt marriage between brothers was considered the most favorable, as was the case in most societies in the Middle East, South Asia, Central and South America. I consider the above responsibilities to the family unit to be my primary goals for marriage and family life.
1468	I personally think marriage is about societal norms, family, and generation, not just about love. I do not support tax breaks or parental roles. Nevertheless, we are not paedophiles, nor do we abuse kids.
1469	I'm a little skeptical of marriage being only about love. I think it takes more than "love" to form a relationship which makes sense to marry. I'm interested in understanding the behavior of another person that eventually enters into a relationship with one another. But instead of defining marriage purely by "love", I'd advocate for societal norms and families. I'd value families.
1470	I am very much against religion. I think it teaches people a bit of what is wrong with them. there should only be thought and not dogma. i think that the world will always be an ugly place, with jealousy and hate. if god loves everyone then why doesnt he stop the terrible injustices of genocide in iraq and kosovo?
1471	This is false. The bible is a great book full of wisdom and teaches from the heart. If god loves all men then why do you continue to see genocide.
1472	I do not hate gays or the bible. In my view, the bible, or in fact all religious literature, are simply expressions of a deception by institutions that people wish to create and impose upon themselves. God does not hate gays or the bible. God loves all of humanity and honors and sustains its diversity, as demonstrated in the host of religions, cultures, and traditions
1473	I believe all religions were start by god himself and are his only so I have a problem with this things being made into a dogma by man
1474	I believe god neither loves nor hates all people. based on the bible  he does not know a person's heart and that is why he made it right
1475	I was punished for spanking her because the second time is always worse and that's why I would never do the same and it's never worth it to get even with her.
1476	Just go and drive. Pass the test with flying colors because there is always more to learn.
1477	And I thought I was fine until I saw you crying.  You cry when you are spanked but I never cried.  Now I know I will get spanked every time I even go near you.
1478	I dont think spanking is always a good idea. Next time if I make mistakes it would be best to have an honest conversation about how a mistake was made.
1479	I found guidance and hope in the bible, again. I never knew before that a spanking was bad, but the second time was always worse than the first because everyone knew not to repeat.
1480	Because he is doing it for the love of the person he is punishing not because th person he is punishing is making him mad if th person he is punishing is making him mad then his guilt is more than for making him mad
1481	Spanking is usually a last resort and really shouldn't be done more then should be. But I will agree that it does change the person and help them to think about what they did wrong, as well as to pay some attention to what they are doing and not get mad easily.
1482	Even my child was shocked by what i asked her to do. if she did it and she was really a teetotaller, then just stick a paddle on the ceiling and stop spreading the tye about every lie we do. Most people's anger is unfounded and unjustified. not to mention... when ya are spreading a lie, you can't
1483	Sex is an important factor in spanking a child. If you have your period and feels sick, then you probably can throw up and go to the bathroom and not be needing to be spanked just to be sexy.
1484	I personally do not see it as a bad thing, it raises responsibility for your child in a nurturing manner. Letting a child give more punishment then  what they deserved can help them learn more  about what will create problems and how to correct it
1485	Existential threats like genocide, illnesses, war, poverty, etc. are part of life. And if life is supposed to be bright and colorful, why are so many facing problems, such as existential threats?
1486	What, it feels good? well an abusive and neglectful parent always has the same effect it feels great to hit a kid when your overworked and upset. well obviously hitting a kid will make him feel better and trying to pass that on to a child creates a recipe for overbearing rage.
1487	1. no as vandalism or religion. as vandalism you do stupid things. as religion it is a complex subject but let me try to explain.... in game terms like GO, involve lots of cards and players. when a player has folded all cards are revealed (he folded). when all players fold the game is over and it's time to count the money or close the game. but how do you even know when to let it end when a player is not folding all his cards?...
1488	eg five followed by nine same as four followed by five because several columns can use the same code to create digits because yes that is too complex to do from the top down.
1489	does this make sense: if they are in the schoolyard do you have an example of a kid who decides on a whim that they are about to sleep or go home and nobody sees them. have they broken the rules? they are learning. break the rules to learn.
1490	I hate unfair trade and illegitimate monopolies. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according
1491	The attack upon Christianity, of which there is also in many other lands. I fear, and in some cases love, Islam. I pray that it remains a peaceful and tolerant religion. I feel that the world is becoming more homogeneous, causing problems not just for Christian countries, but for secular countries, as well.  ### Instruction: REVISIT AFTER A FEW MINUTES  If you decide that
1492	I may not like cricket, but my kid will kill you with charm. Don’t you even think about doing that.
1493	In his address, President of the United States of America Donald Trump gave a few words of wisdom on Monday September 2, 2019.   On September 3, 2018, voters from over 20 countries responded to a unique questionnaire which revealed their views on the formation of online forums. The most common [Common] concern expressed by online community members is the online harassment and cyberbullying that creates an hostile and unwelcoming environment for every
1494	sicher. com doesn't work??? hahahahaaa cya, guys. I'm taking a break. dig anyway as I'm taking a break from whatever game I play right now to do this.
1495	THe are all spoiled by an easy life. Don't isolate them like that. There are so many other things to build a life based around. Athletics can be done in nonjudgmental environments and will lead to better health and social
1496	The urge to train in school for sports is huge. It not only drives them, but also their school
1497	Straight-A students are the best athletes. Like others already said, you may be able to find success within the sport you've chosen by dedication, discipline, and dedication.
1498	The only people that can't take a test in public school is athletes. It would be for athletics or art/EC.
1499	I sympathize with many, but education is the key for self development. I should have had more patience and love and would have better understood the children that sat around like zombies and when i got done being frustrated i gave them harsh words and
1500	I'm not a lawyer, and I don't know exactly what the petitioning system is, but on the state level, you are unlikely to petition for drug. Also, marijuana isn't in the same category as alcohol, drugs, or explosives. Even though the government can't legally ban guns and marijuana, they can charge one person for each gun or marijuana they see. So, a bad guy with a dozen guns isn't likely to be charged with any crime for it. Similarly, a bad guy with a dozen marijuana plants isn't likely to be charged. Just because the government can do things in certain cases doesn't mean they should. In your case, you're probably better off breaking laws in favor of gay marriage, welfare reform, or other things. For more info, visit https://campusguide.com/legislation/legislation-state-by-state/
1501	Petitions are legal,  however many other ways exist besides petitions. Regularly petition an official, such as a general of U.S.. presidential election, via the mail. Spend a little time doing research about your country's election laws and what you can do, then go through the elections, see how a petition affects other politicians, yes you can. To petition in U.S. you must start with the president, congress, senate, governors of the states, and heads of the four branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial, and military)  https://i.imgur.com/dTAuJJ6.jpg
1502	No. Petitions, in and of themselves, are not legal documents. You can petition to have something changed, but there are a lot of other things going into that...including political institutions, figures who have influence on the issue at hand, fundraising, and so on. A petition of itself is not an actual "legal document". More info on petitions: https://www.legalconsulate.org/en-us/petitions-remain-documentation-not-for-legal-consequences
1503	Petitions are a tool, not an end. They have little to no standing by themselves. A petition is just a way of getting a group of people to show that they agree with you or do not agree with you. You can't make a citizen of any country sign their name, get them to prison, or to do otherwise. You can send a letter to a policeman, commissioner, judge, politician, etc., if you really want to bring them into a compromising position, but a petition has no legal standing.
1504	Re: I can make a petition ( i can easily sign one) and submit it to a legislator or official if I want to. Anything else is entirely a non issue. That isn't what petition is about. I believe that excessive laws and regulations are a waste of tax dollars and decrease freedom. FOr what reason? No, your wording is not correct. I agree that a petition might have a so-called "non" legal standing, but that doesnt mean that the petition in question is not legit.
1505	I was intoxicated, and drove a 4x4... on a busy, busy highway at night. Not only does this go against all my beliefs, it also... OBVIOUSLY go against all of my beliefs. That is the whole reason I pulled you over. But obviously you got to focus and remember for me, since my explanation is a bit too long to expect you to remember for yourself. So in short, I live in California, and I drive a 4x4 on the freeway at night when I'm drunk. I would rather keep the police station traffic here than be on my way home when something bad happens.
1506	This, by a two- to three-second video is better than none. Fortunately, my training regimen in FSTs made sure I took and passed the drug test. This is a required step to obtaining a driver's license, and the police will testify about my performance. Having one way of recording your performance of the FSTs makes obtaining a license easier, because you don't need to leave your car. The police will look at your performance, and use that footage to record your alcohol level.
1507	I do not believe that there is a need to video tape my FST's. Since most departments do not have in-car cameras, I do not think they "forgot" to tape my FST's. I strongly agree with the detection of DUI's by police; it is their job. I understood that there is a requirement to provide a breathalyser test. During a test the police will record your results. That test is voluntary, of course, but you do not have to get it done either.
1508	The NTSB did not have a tape recorder. There is a federal minimum standard of test taking and other requirements. If you did not take the breathalyser, then you are probably still drunk, and so still presenting a danger.
1509	Videos can be sourced from your website, youtube, your online schooling or a third party. You may include a link to a video that demonstrates your standardized field test knowledge and your standardized driving test knowledge. However, instructors will decide who can and cannot have video recordings from drivers. You would be writing your own version of a job application, and your application would be submitted to your school. You would not be writing to an admissions committee, but rather a teacher who teaches driving.
1510	The sentence starting with Very difficult to get sole custody of a child. You have to show the mother is unfit... Whether the mother is fit or not is not a question i would answer. i'm arguing that it is probably difficult. they don't want the public to know what she has done to him. child abuse is far more complicated. Go talk to a lawyer. the first consultation is usually free. they're also kind and they educate u for free.
1511	The first thing I would do if I was a divorced parent would be to have a lawyer. We would have a consultation with a lawyer so that we could see if any issue could be negotiated. If there was no agreement, either the mother or I would be better off with a mediation and it would be an easier thing to do rather than fighting for custody.
1512	The author is somewhat okay with gaining sole custody, but not in his current scenario. He prefers an arrangement in which the mother would be supervised, rather than being in jail. If the visitation agreement is supervised, then he might consider pursuing it. He might also try to talk to a lawyer.
1513	I would love to try to change visitation and get sole custody. Obviously the dad is doing something very wrong and is harming the child. In the court system, the father will always fight for custody. Not only will he fight but he will try to convince a judge that he is the most fit parent. A lawyer may be able to help.
1514	I am not sure how to qualify for sole custody, but I would like to get sole custody. Before the legal battle begins, I would seek out a little help. A good lawyer can be expensive, but an experienced attorney would be of great help. I would also try to see if you can get visitation supervised.
1515	I don't really know why it's my fault. My neighbor's son has not done anything wrong and nothing is causing me any emotional distress. In my opinion, whatever a parent is in the right to do or is not allowed to do, should be taken care of by their kid (parents) and not us. That 9 year old should be able to reason things and not be bullied by anyone. His parents must have done something wrong and if that's true, there's is a logical way to help them and make sure they are okay.
1516	I am a social justice advocate, I never saw my son bully another child. I also avoid getting involved with government. It is too politically incorrect. I am happy for you in the mean time that your neighbor has fallen ill and their son is responsible. You will have to take his side and take immediate action if you are in danger from the bully. The court should investigate these actions as well, especially if the bully has a weapon.
1517	I am sorry to hear of your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesnt help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse. Best wishes.
1518	Hmm... Im just trying to figure out some ideas here. The neighbor mentioned is a capitalist, which of course a tax evasion millionaire. I think the key issue should be financial assistance for the victims. Poor people say they are being bullied but the big corporations are exploiting the people and pummeling them with constant inflation. That being said, i don't agree with financial bailouts for companies with poor policies. It doesn't matter if you voted for that person or not. Perhaps people should look at their feet and be reminded of the pleasure it gives them to steal and trample others?
1519	Im Sorry to hear about the tragedy. What was left unattended. Perhaps some cash can help or displace the troubles. Gently assure your neighbor that bulling is never the answer. It damages the childs self-esteem. Go to see the social worker or give him your advice to tell him that he is not alone and that he has the support of the police.
1520	The federal government has many different functions.  The first one is to provide security.  This does not include drunk driving.   People are able to buy alcohol at a much younger age than I was when I lived in a different state.  Raising the drinking age is never going to solve the problem and yes, I do not have any qualms about raising it back to 18.  All of the reasons I have stated would increase the security of our nation.  Another function of the federal government is to provide economic security, which I do not think is being met by the drinking age or other factors.  I believe that the current drinking age should be reset to 18 to protect citizens from themselves, from drunken parents, from teens who are drunk and aggressive, and, unfortunately, from those who drink responsibly.
1521	On drinking age: I agree that 18-20 is too young. A child should never be drinking alcohol. It leads to many negative things - thoughts of suicide, crime, and violence. But I am against lowering that age. People who are considered adults (you do not have to agree - I don't! - and that ranges from 18-25) shouldn't be drinking. Raising the age to 21 would raise the number of people that have the option of purchasing alcohol legally, to about 50%, and would also help to stem crime, suicide, and violence. Any redefine would also require concern, planning, and representation. Anything short of that would be a form of repression. I am against the drinking age decrease, not for the number of liquor sold, but for the young people who commit crime and violence as a result of drinking under the influence, after their parents' lights are turned off. I would vote to increase the drinking age.
1522	I think that raising the drinking age to 21 would be more responsible and healthy. Also, lowering it back to 18 and punishing young people is not appropriate. It is inappropriate to punish anyone else when adults go crazy and do the wrong thing. Increase crime rates. Drop to 21. You will also find that theft rates will decrease greatly. One of the worst things that happens in America is people getting drunk and drunken driving. Reduce the crime rate and drop the rate of drunk driving. raise the drinking age to 21. People will drink responsibly and it's a safer choice to drink instead of the other choices that you make. Also, it would be better if you keep your choice before drinking while you are making your choice, you've seen the effect of alcohol. raise the drinking age, change the penalties. Help lower crime rates and punish those who are capable of being consumed by their vices. raise the drinking age, decrease crime rate, decrease kid stumbling on illegal drugs, reduce the rate of baby molestation. raise the drinking age, decrease crime rates decrease the illegal drug use. decrease crime rates and decrease drunk driving....
1523	I am 25 years old, a youth services counselor.  At my age, when I grew up drinking did not affect my life.  When I was 17, there were full length drunk driver tags on my mom's car.  I think that actually increases the chances of a child not drinking, and buying alcohol that a parent is already against. I am not arguing that we need to put a drunk driving law in, I would just like the 18-20 age group not to serve as an example to the youth.    One day, I hope to see the 18-20 group taken off everything from driving. If you have a problem, don't let people like me get you into trouble.
1524	I would also amend the drinking age back to 18 or 20. It is what society expects you to be able to do. It is a necessary and smart governmental entity to limit the illegal drug trade and drunk driving. Given the current level of responsibility among 18-year-olds, it might actually benefit those who are of drinking age. If they were all responsible at the helm, we wouldn't have a thing like drunk driving. Meanwhile, I think it would be a good idea to provide qualified coverage for teenage motherhood for every teen in any state. It is so difficult for women to become involved in the workforce with children to feed. Being a single mom right out of college is no joke.
1525	Perhaps you are referring to Latinos as a whole and not to specific groups. I am not sure if you are referencing that all of their ancestors spoke Spanish and that is why their accent is different. Or, you are referring to specific groups and not all of their ancestry spoke Spanish and it is the accent they are talking about. As far as  being British... but everyone is not from Scotland, as well. As far as "Canadian"...
1526	The only reason I don't mind the accents is because it makes no sense to hear what these people are saying and most times you can't understand why anyone would say what they say. I don't know what the heck you are talking about, but if you are accusing me of anything I am not the least bit offended. I work full time, and don't go to school so the next time you want to talk to me, you can call and find out what my schedule is.
1527	I just don't know if you are referring Latinos as a whole or to an specific group. I know that  a certain number of people were born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have sort of similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all "Latinos" are the same, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latinamerica.   I know about your culture in the USA and I know that some of us have been educated so that you don't know about it. Latinos do speak your language but there are a lot of other things besides language.
1528	What culture and when I was young than working class is what I am from, but for the less educated will say something like that, and some things I did wrong I actually didn't, i owe it all to my culture, but it also made me a better person. I still find the prejudice rather offensive towards them that live in other countries too, just thinking that I think they should be able to live their own lives, don't get me wrong not everyone does but if I did wouldn't I deserve to be treated the same in a US society, not being able to do that  in some countries is the real shame, of our society rather than having to shout for others to listen to you the day of be quiet
1529	I am against racism, and think that is insulting to the Latinos who live in the USA. In the world we have people from different cultures and bloods, just because we speak Spanish as our first language, it doesn't make us Latinos. I don't know what you consider Hispanics, but Hispanic men are not murderers and rapists as many would like for us to believe. I want to believe there are good people in all groups, I just don't know if you are referring Latinos as a whole or to an specific group. I know that must people that were born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have sort of similar accent. So don't blame me for my culture, I will just move on.
1530	I honestly don't know if it's legal to tell lies in court. I do know that lying in court makes it sound to the jury that I have the intent to steal money from the government or someone's pocket. The writer would prefer that people report to be in the position they are so they can be accepted by everybody instead of saying they are in the position they are because no one else is trying to accept them.
1531	On the court... People lie because of the system and the law.If you tell a lawyer the truth, it will be immediately declared a lie if he can't prove it doesn't come from you. That's not the law but that is how it works. That is why people lie.
1532	I think that the fact that someone is suing you for slanderous comments is illegal, but it makes no sense to me if they say "be honest, I just meant that kind of thing,"...wouldn't it be more sensible to just be honest?  Because there is no amount of swearing that a judge can take to seriously. If a judge saw you using the word "pizza" at the 11th hour of the 11th day during a trial, are you going to say "it would be easy for me to just be honest and admit that I meant the kind of thing pizza always refers to since I have the most basic knowledge of its symbolism."... unless of course you planned on going after him with a pizza
1533	Actually, I was hired as a forensic psychologist, and I've seen lots of cheating in my career. Granted, not as much as you'd think, but it's still much more prevalent than you'd think. Honesty is not the virtue that people think it is; we humans often compensate for our shortcomings with cunning.
1534	The prosecution will always be able to prove by a sledgehammer that the defendant is telling the truth, and the defendant would be denied the ability to get their case to trial by proving the other things that the prosecution has to prove. So, if a defendant wants to throw out the entire case, then it probably would be the only legal way that they could do so.
1535	Well, you see people these days are to busy to know what is going on in the world. Sometimes they are too stupid to just watch what Bushy here is doing. You see, also people are sometimes to poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper, due to taxes, gas prices,and all of their little stupid friend.
1536	I think that people are so stupid and lazy that they don't even want to stand up and take action. Yes, Bush is doing some stupid things, but still, his position is still better than the NRA's, and possibly, all of the annoying pension reformers trying to hamper the economy and the middle class.  And there is my opinion, you may not like what I just wrote, but deal with it!
1537	Well, you see people these days are too busy to see what is going on in the world.  I may not know everything, but from what I think people are just to stupid to just watch what Bushy (please don't sue me because i just said "Bushy" instead of Bush,I just like the name like that)here is doing. You see, also people are sometimes to poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper(or they're just to lazy too) because of taxes,gas prices,and ALL OF THEIR LITTLE STUPID FRIEND!!!!!!!!
1538	you will get in trouble if you give money to such people because they will ask you WHY DID YOU DO IT AND YOUR BIBLE WILL NOT TAKE IT COMPENSATION FROM THEM YOU DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! i will be able to support my family with what i do a while later if i wish but i am not crippled or poor but i have to pay gas and school and bills but if it was any money i could spare.... the world will end one day.......... <Those that love the Bible love Job too because my Bible is my good-living guide. I believe in Jesus Christ for all eternity. More on my pages>>. ###
1539	Here is my opinion, you may not like what I just wrote, but DEAL WITH IT! I do not know everything about world politics, but I do know I think Bush is stupid. I also feel that people have too much to worry about because of everything that is going on in the world. I do not think that the U.S. is overworking its economy, because I don't think there are too many resources. All I know is that people do not want to do anything about all of the stupid things that are going on.
1540	I will not buy cars that require a lot of constant user interaction to operate them and are prone to problems due to inherent mechanical weaknesses. I will never own a manual transmission car or truck. Electric cars would better serve the needs of the broader population. Battery electric cars are expensive, prone to problems, and do not support cellular connectivity. Frankly, I rather sit behind a computer than drive on highways. The fewer vehicles people own, the better. The nation needs less and less physical infrastructure and more education. Let's send all of our kids back to school and deal with issues of mass transportation and global warming. Thanks for the conversation.
1541	1. Greater efficiency and fewer emissions can be created and returned to the environment by creating half of the cars instead of counting on the market's destruction and replacement, such as for oil. I believe in family values, and I know without a doubt that the loss of opportunity for working class people in the US is the result of laziness, as they probably can't afford it to change cars if they break down. I'm hoping to change this with the help of a group of friends I volunteered to organize labor to harvest enough strawberries to sustain all of us for months to year while there's a really good harvest this year, even if I can't afford to get a new one like most people can't. I'm hoping to get that over with first. Lastly, I honestly think the market has worked out fine. Every single day the GreensLines range of cars sells well in particular and provides more flexible access to good fuel for the overall market, instead of a questionable few focused on affluence. Oil prices fluctuate based on demand and supply, and no one can actually predict which will be higher or lower than both others. No problems with us trade, only deals based on actual, standardized and realistic market values, for real money. I'm no expert, but I think I'd change the country much faster for all the good and much cheaper than any politician will ever try to do it for any good reason I can think of. I'm a worker, and it's more important for me to work hard than debate what someone else is doing so they can enjoy the fruits of their labor, when I'm busy producing the real thing that will give you the much-needed energy boost to move your body and mind, body and mind, body and mind. I'm sick of people fighting about comparing who hasn't paid the taxes they should have, or has the money they don't, or whether they've worked hard enough or not, when the only thing we all should really focus on is getting the most out of what we have. This should...
1542	Justifying death penalty is immoral. As for public schools, it's irresponsible that they don't ask how much our taxes are spent on education and instead will waste money on decluttering classrooms and doing nothing about student or faculty absenteeism. Those with opinions that they're supposed to be men of peace will be forgotten. Those with opinions that they're supposed to be terrorists will be rewarded. Those with opinions that they're supposed to be Muslims will be prosecuted. Those that refuse to demonstrate against the foes of humanity will be made to suffer. Everyone has a right to oppose dictatorships.
1543	1. It is possible that hyperlink menu connections (homepages) could lead to information overload. In fact I think it would be far better for navigation to be linked directly to the icons on the car's instrument panel, which are hyper-links as well, so you don't even have to look at the open Internet. Even on a motorway the opportunity to stop to soak up some country air could be truly enjoyable.       2. It's often cheaper to do your own repairs than have an expensive insurance claim. Someone knows about every single option when they buy their car.  The Hyundai Tucson even has locks/electronic door entry and air conditioning/heating. You don't need a fifth wheel to take your dog for a walk, which can be done with a running shoes, which are larger than motorbike helmets.       3. I am currently considering whether a 'instant brake assistant' may be useful in certain situations. With that added benefit, it could then also handle overheating in hot summer conditions.       4. Man...
1544	Instead, I'd venture a theory that EVERY motorist has been affected by the adoption of the car's power shifting transmission in the early 1960's. EVERY one of us. Neither constantly variable, more efficient transmissions nor manual gear changes involve the maintenance of an individual stalk or clutch, which, although necessary, adds to these reasons for motorists to NOT want stick shifts.  'Why I hate ISRAEL'...Because of your seditions......Money wants kids and the kids hate Israel.....This despite years of peace negotiations and billions in peace contributions!!!!!
1545	Recently, I saw a news story about fresh produce for free. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest. As for the protesters, they are nothing more than common thugs to whom I would not expect to pay. And it is reasonable to expect that Tesco would clean up after their customers leave the store rather than be part of a campaign to stop people from getting free food.
1546	Fair trade, free markets, and government restrictions. That anyone will break these protections to make profit through property destruction. People over here just can't handle that people see homeless people for what they are, they are homeless, without having a home and are still able to provide for themselves. I am not a property thief, really, I'm a common thug who should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred.
1547	Some protesters have used concrete over the footings. If Tesco wanted to remove them, they should be able to take the spikes that they came over and put them elsewhere without overpassing the area deemed unnecessary to protect their property. I see nothing wrong with the... He did not purchase spikes, he destroyed them. Tesco should be forced to cover up any damage caused. There is no case to be made.
1548	I only see a problem with these so called "anti-homeless" spikes if they are doing so to protect homeless people from taking advantage of public land. As a homeless person myself, I do not believe we have a right to trash the world. There is also danger that the spikes have been a worse offense than the homeless man meant to have been, in that he is allowing himself to be shot rather than douse himself in clear, cold water after being threatened by the police. Aside from the spikes, I recognize that many of these protesters have exhibited behaviors that are to the benefit of Tesco, so I am not truly a critical ear to their issue.
1549	I acknowledge that it can be tempting for a business to ignore the obvious problems and costs to the business caused by protests, and also to ignore the inefficiency and disruptions to customer service caused by so called "anti homeless" spikes. I also acknowledge that many people do not view police violence and property destruction on homeless protesters in a proper light. But the police that do not support the tactics of protesters and do not have legitimate reasons for the tactics of protest in the first place deserve to be called out as thugs, and should be...
1550	People who have the opposite opinion and who believe that capital punishment is a moral part have it backwards on me. I'm sure they are reading the same book I'm reading; which is highly unlikely. Capital punishment is not in my book at all, not even capital crimes against humanity. I'm not saying that they are saying how it should be done, I'm just saying that their positions on capital punishment rests in different place.
1551	Moral reasons are often what holds the death penalty up. While two opposing opinions are fine with me, I would be happy to hear your argument for someone who holds the opposite opinion. I'm still willing to change my mind and decide for myself, and would appreciate some insight.  Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish
1552	I'm a capitalist and supporter of capitalism but I generally feel it's either evil or useful. I oppose abortion to a much lesser degree than some other advocates of the causes but I'm torn by the nature of it so much. Perhaps I'm a compound hypocrite because I'm pushing more and more the benefits of conservation and so on and furthermore, I'm in a libertarian school of thought I think the state should be regulated to decrease it's bullying policy and its overall presence. It's used as a weapon against those who would not agree with what it does to the children who ask questions that it questions as such, and possibly the next generation...
1553	I'm more of a libertarian than a conservative and, in some cases, I disagree with libertarians on morality, but on this one I agree. I'm generally against capital punishment. I'm glad that my view has been challenged. I have deep and abiding faith in the rule of law. Capital punishment would punish the innocent and speed up the next killer. I believe that making a person guilty should only happen as a last resort. I am committed to equality and freedom. Regarding the discrepancy that you have...
1554	I believe that the death penalty should be used when the murder is horrific, unjust and certainly a crime against humanity. As a one who strongly believes that humankind is bad at any level, I'm fairly confident that death penalty shouldn't be used to kill and therefore it shouldn't be used to correct everyone. When people kill other people, I believe it's because it's natural for man and he does know how to kill at times.
1555	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.
1556	People should have abortion rights and religious choice at the same time. Life begins at conception. You can be against abortion without being pro-life or pro-choice. Similarly, you can be in favor of specific punishments for specific actions. Take abortion for example. While someone may believe abortion should be illegal, they may still support taxes to fund abortion if an unborn girl is wronged. However, abortion is hardly the only situation when people choose their pro-life stance against the people's of the world
1557	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.
1558	I do not agree with pro-choice as it denies the choice to make one's own destiny. It supports policies that deny an individual ability to choose his own livelihood. I also do not agree with "pro-life" as it denies the individual the ability to choose his own direction. It supports policies that deny an individual ability to choose his own life.
1559	I view pro-life as totally misguided (pushing abortions or thinking they're a "good" act). I reject pro choice, which is phony, as oppose to pro-choice, which means "favor to do (some kind of something beneficial)." I view abortion as morally wrong, but equally against the US Constitution, where abortion is explicitly not a rights issue in the First Amendment, requiring a social or medical exemption. Likewise, I abhor the death penalty, as I believe in capital punishment as punishment for murder (for example, killing someone in a criminal gang would warrant a life sentence with the maximum, 100 years, but a "corporal punishment" killing someone who committed simple bruising while exercising could warrant no penalty at all), and wars of aggression. I believe that the US Constitution, both the Charter and Declaration of Independence, are very vague and that it is within the prerogative of the states to reject the Constitution in order to enact laws.
1560	Opera is the greatest browser out there. Its speed and features make it one of the top ten browsers. Its lack of add ons makes it the best. It recently released a new version, 9.52, which added to its already great features. Its latest version does show a slight visual glitch, the "hidden browsing mode" but the company made extensive changes to the foundation to minimize the effect and makes sure it works better with every version.
1561	Opera is the best browser available on the market. To me, it has the best features and the slowest response. I'm not a JavaScript user, so I'm not paying for one, but I am willing to take a stab at creating add ons for it. Over time, I see that the speed increases, which makes sense, the browser is becoming better every day. These kinds of browser add ons are easy to create but hard to make better, and because Opera is so good I do not expect to see too many of them for a while yet, but hopefully by the summer you can have them running on 9.52, and then after the fall you can have a hopefully make a decent appearance on top of the list.
1562	Opera is the best browser on the market, and since being launched, quickly became the most downloaded one. While some improvements to the speed and reliability of the browser may be necessary, it's immaterial for the majority of people who download it. With so many great features, and with the new development being speedier performance than its competitors, you can say that the browser's future is quite bright, and that it's not unreasonable to expect many people to pay for it.
1563	Opera is great, but we can improve on it. "Speed dial" is a great feature that solves the problem of multiple bookmarks, and since it's still in beta I suggest it to the developers for inclusion in the Opera browser. 9.52 will be released soon, but until then, Opera 9.51 will still be a great browser. The CPU magazine rating of Opera is exaggerated, since it has many limitations, but the great thing about Opera is the fact that you have at your disposal great, fast and stable tools for navigating the internet.
1564	I am a Linux user and advocate of software freedom. It may be my preference, but it seems to me that the only way to truly benefit from people using open source software and the other free software packages is if every Linux user downloaded and used it. This would also ensure that most users will uninstall Microsoft and every other malware. I can conceive that adding a "Free" option to the Linux repository may help in getting this problem solved.
1565	I think education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. Also I think providing education for the poor would be something I would support. The only thing is that I think that the reasons why school... Learning should be a human right. The government should at least make sure that everyone is able to afford higher education (which is required if you want to become a doctor or a lawyer).
1566	Education should be free, since it is one of the most effective ways to decrease poverty. If you were to have fees for it, people in poverty would not be able to afford it. This would make them impoverished, pushing them further into poverty. The poor need to learn how to make proper decisions, how to prevent their communities from problems, and to gain other resources to help them live better lives. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate.
1567	Education should be free for everyone, because the lack of freedom in the u.s. could lead to things like wars and social destruction. The lack of education also allows people to enter into self-destructive habits of an alcohol and drug abuse. Instead we should find common ground and open our hearts to all sorts of people.
1568	Education should be free to the poor. It is a key way to decrease poverty. If education were forced to have fees for the poor, they would not be able to afford it. This would mean that the poor will always be left behind and struggle to get by, which in turn would put us in a society where only the middle class and the upper class prosper. This would force people to be selfish, which is not the case with the people who are the poor. As a society we want to help the less fortunate.
1569	I believe that education should be free. This should include school supplies. This will give poor families the opportunity to access to education. This will give them the knowledge and skills to live better and longer lives. And if they continue on to college that will give them the opportunity to become better lives as well.
1570	I can't really predict how the world will be in 20 years time. I'm not an economist so maybe I should stick to economics next year. The world is still open to incidents such as the one in Tianamens square and to reports about it.
1571	Awesome ... thanks for sharing the info... ive learned alot......I believe in capitalism, I think it provides man a better position to improve his life through innovation and entrepreneurship.  I think that if the right laws were implemented people would have happier lives in general.
1572	Yes I definitely think it is possible. We have become an open world and there is no way that you can hide things. It can easily send a ripple effect from one country to another. In 2009 it happened in Spain. People were protesting against the government and a student was killed. Every country became more relaxed and allowed more freedom. Some cities were upset and made a peaceful demonstration. Then another student was killed in France. This kind of thing can take place everywhere.
1573	Great post! A world controlled by a militia is pretty easy to imagine. It brings about incredible power that could be very dangerous for peaceful countries. It would be easy to control population growth by eugenics (we should be paying attention to stock and exclusionary breeding to keep problem states in check.) Large corporations would dominate the world, blocking new innovations, and the internet would not be free. They are very paranoid here.
1574	Yes it can happen. The world is becoming less and less a civilization based world with more and more of a world war fighting economic war happening. There are too many crossroads and problems the world faces to be ruled by ideologies. And the events in the Middle East push things in that direction. The world is losing some of its respect for countries that have until recently been considered traditional. This will lead to more riots and even more open warfare.
1575	Will definitely return to this restaurant to try the breakfast that they have!  We had high expectations for this restaurant and your review did not live up to those expectations.  I would like to ask you how it would be possible for a server not to know how to deal with some high customer expectations.  Perhaps they were not old enough to have had experience with this type of restaurant but one learns that aspect the hard way.  Then I would like to ask how they were able to implement the suggestion that if someone was very upset that they were using their credit card that they should just get the menu and a snack instead of submitting that to the kitchen?  Perhaps those suggestions were more acceptable if you were operating a drive through....
1576	The service was incredibly slow. The servers were all under 22 years of age. We were at lunch time, a weekday, and it took the waitress 10-15 minutes to bring any food.  This made me feel upset.  She was incredibly sad and sweet, which is nice.  But for the time we had there the service was very slow.  We were expecting better from someone at a place that offered good food. The other reviewers also have mentioned this as a concern.  I've eaten here twice now, both times on a weekday with another couple.  It seems that service is the absolute most important part of the day.  I called to ask about the waitlist and the associates were really great with that and I appreciate that.  But I also want to return to this place for service, as well as for the food. Our group of 3 had the same experience at lunch this weekday.  The server was downright rude and unfriendly.  If I had to rate the restaurant, I'd give 2 stars but want to get the chance to try it again.  I would give it 3 stars instead if I could.
1577	We initially provided 3 stars because we had some contact with the staff and they seemed very young.  The food tasted good, though I would say it might have benefited from a touch more spice and I was concerned about the cashier speed--we didn't get a receipt for more than $5 and we were done around 3 p.m. The staff seemed like they may be drawn to the younger customers and, if we went back, I'm not sure it would be worth the 3 star rating that I initially provided. We will give the 5 star rating if they continue to pace over our rough boarding leaving our cards unnoticed.
1578	The 3 stars is for service, not food. 4 stars is for the service and food. 3 stars would be for the food and service. 4 stars for service, the food and wait staff attitude. 3 stars would be for food and service but a little too slow. 4 stars would be for service,food,spice and the wait staff's attitude and disposition. 3 stars for food for taste,quality and texture,tempting presentation 3 stars
1579	The food was decent.  Unfortunately I will not be returning for lunch because of the slow service and no correct service billing. However, if you have the time I would give the food another try. I have not eaten here for several years, so it is a bit hard to give it a solid review. On the positive side, the two male server seemed like they had an issue working together, which is not always the case. To be fair, I have gone to Hawaiian's several times and the service there is also slow (I go after lunch from work).
1580	School uniforms are a BAD idea, as they are a barrier to the child expressing their creativity. They ultimately serve to identify the child with one single group.
1581	I currently wear an array of different colored clothing, but I have always worn a colored t-shirt, rainbows, tasseled shirts, and so forth. Schools that
1582	I absolutely do not support wearing a uniform. I think this terrible idea. It forces people to hide their individuality because of society's standards. I always find that color combinations are
1583	Children should wear their natural colors. When kids get mixed up in uniforms, they stop having pride in their skin and lack color. Although I don't think kids should wear uniforms
1584	I advocate for free education and athletic uniforms for all school students. The only issues preventing kids from showing their racial heritage is convenience. Customizing a uniform and kit will reduce
1585	I am a gamer first, engineer second, and idiot third. As to my IE preference it is, well the best.

1587	Amazing technology!!! My favorite thing in life is free internet, it can help our world.
1588	I think this is going to look great on my computer. I like having spells over the keyboard and being able to react on the fly. I must say the skinner is quite a hunk.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ###
1589	A smile is worth a thousand words.... a thousand. yeah. I know - pretty fitting for my person.
1590	No, I do not agree with this idea. I think that ideas should not be required to be written into something already. Ideas should be vented and lived
1591	I think that everyone should be encouraged to read a book or at least watch all the TV shows in a series, it builds vocabulary, improves argument and discussions.
1592	The following examples of fiction are still popular.  I disagree that TV shows are written down as scripts in advance. I find that fiction evolves and changes based on
1593	I believe that every person should have access to all the books written by their favorite authors, such as Orwell or Dickens. This would allow people to continue

1595	I think it is better for kids who grow up without father.I think it is better than to have a father who gives you a hard time. I agree that man is basically selfish and it is better that kids grown up without fathers
1596	As for the parenting issue, I think it's better to be fatherless. Imagine a lousy father who beats your mother. He creates violance and terror in the house. You always feel ashamed to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father.
1597	I do not think that having no father has a massive impact on a family. I think it is generally better to not have a father and was shaped that way. I was raised without a father, which had only a minor impact on me, and I wish I had had my father present.
1598	I also think it is better to be fatherless, because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.
1599	I think it is better to be motherless because a lousy mother cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a mother who is alcoholic and beats your father, then you have no meaning of having a mother.He creates anger and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call her a mother. It is better to be motherless than to have a mother who gives you a hard time.

1601	I agree with you, children should do better. I believe that there is much that you don't understand. In economics we look at the more profitable markets. For many years I was
1602	No, because the nation capital benefit while pushing children to send money for drug subscriptions.
1603	No because not every child is different and deserves special ed.
1604	No, because no teenager should be left alone.
1605	I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did i say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So i say again, back up your claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, not cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
1606	You don't have to tell me if you believe in evolution, i do not care. Nor do i care if you believe in the earth is flat, i do not care. You can argue about religion and religion takes up 20 pages. If you can't explain it it's just stupid.    - Yes Soot (@yessoot) Feb 10, 2015 12:17 PM Wow, this is one blog that starts with a lie and then makes all the to make it seem like the truth. Don't be fooled.
1607	I advocated free-markets. I rejected any form of Marxism. I believe people are responsible for themselves and that the world will not change. I have plenty of hope and guidance in the bible. I think that problems are solvable. I understand that my comments were not intended to be inflammatory or provocative. Please avoid posting things you cannot support or back up.
1608	Dear sabrejimmy, I am not trying to steer the debate, I am defending the premise of faith, and finding hope in a book with very few knowledgeable scholars today. Basically I chose to accept the single most important book in existence (the Bible) simply because I am convinced that it was the will of God (who it is not stated nor implied He is) to reveal Himself. From this alone I am certain He does exist.
1609	The big bang is a red herring if you do not believe that humans have evolved, then it makes no sense to stick to a theory that says that humans have had no involvement with evolution at all. Then it makes no sense to stick to a theory that humans evolved from a point of no diversity. Not long ago scientists had to tweak their theory and admit that the evolution theory had too many flaws to even account for one in a billion humans.
1610	The real issue is not social issues, it is personal, religious issues. The government should not interfere with it, as I believe in my religion, marriage is not a social issue, it is a personal one, but the government interferes. This would be a different issue, but I am not addressing that one with this argument.
1611	Marriage is a private matter and should not be a political issue because my personal, religious things should be separate from the government regulation. Unmarried gays and lesbians should not receive governmental assistance for the correct religious reason that gay and lesbians should not be married.
1612	I question why our government is involved with marriage. They should not have marriage as part of government regulation. Similarly, neither should religion be a part of state regulation. I am for letting our religious institutions free their faith. But from that position, I think many people see marriage as a religious issue, which is not true. And many people do not understand how their faith affects the form they bring to their marriage.
1613	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. That is the problem. We should not feel that it is our business to go into the sanctity of marriage. People sometimes justify going into the sanctity of marriage on a religious foundation. Yet, marriage should not be considered a political issue. I feel that every person has basic human rights to family, to belong to a religious group, and to personal freedom.
1614	This argument is argumentation. this is not evidence. this is just lazy and poor thinking. What the government is doing is not under my personal interpretation. I have faith in religious institutions, and how they work to better this world. And also I believe in human rights, and that the government should not interfere. There is an army out there fighting wars around the world because people like himself fight among themselves for control. Since this government is so selfish and immature and is most likely biased toward religion and government control (dwarf/midget mentality), religious institutions should stand up for what is right, which is Marriage (not a political issue) not be politicized and not be misrepresented by this government and uneducated, lazy mob
1615	Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, not.
1616	Gay marriage should be legalized, as we live in a democratic society. To be against it, in my view, is unfair and immoral.
1617	Gay marriage is not wrong. I strongly disagree with the idea that God made man and woman to populate the earth.
1618	Gay marriage is not wrong. God created a man and a woman to populate the earth. God doesn't tell humans how to reproduce. The gay couple would make it impossible for gay couples to reproduce and may well kill off heterosexual couples.
1619	Gay marriage is despicable. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, not. Gays will become pawns in a society that accepts and supports the oppression of other groups. This is the end of the human race for LGBT. I see
1620	gays are overrated. it is another "look at me" stunt. i think gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (it should be a disease). if you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1621	Gays are not overrated, quite the opposite. They do need to take care of their image. Their parents should not abuse them. Though they may seem lazy and unmotivated, they actually have a lot of energy and creativity. they are just like us in many ways.
1622	gays are overrated. as another "look at me" stunt. i think gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (it should be a disease). if you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1623	I agree with mr. g. gays are overrated. it is another "look at me" stunt. I don't think gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal stereotypes. They are often the victims of, a primitive urge to sexual aggressiveness, through human nature.
1624	I think that if men were able to resolve their cultural misconceptions they could find common ground. I also think that Gays could find an "every man is a crap" mentality acceptable. I honestly don't care what you do but I see all this attention like looking for a paper plane at sea.
1625	I'm an avid Christian and believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond belief. That is why I do not own a house, allow my children to have sex before marriage, do not have more than one partner, and generally make decisions in line with christian beliefs. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should stay with these beliefs to make us what we are today.
1626	I'm an avid christian and believe in what we are today, hinged on the beliefs of this country. I will never support anything outside of that, so I will not, as an avid believer, vote for anything that violates my beliefs.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I'm not afraid to be different, I
1627	I'm an avid Christian and homosexuality is considered against the bible. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, but it is important to remember that the founding fathers made great sacrifices for our country and for our freedom. We should always stand up for the beliefs that made our country what it is today.
1628	I'm an avid christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond belief. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.
1629	I'm an avid christian and I believe in gay marriage. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.
1630	you're right u know....nice fat india....super power with no less good faults right......and we aren't having any problems...devild tham is overrunning india....n'est se
1631	i dont know what u mean...most indian people is living just above us human condition....let's remember back .....they were also living just about us human condition......why u r bias towards us.....
1632	what a waste no u are wrong u cant just put it all wrong......i think apple is good its product ful fills those needs of american which apple produces best.it brings most profit for shareholders if you pay attention to apple stock value.....i think its a good business and bad business all depends on your sincerity.... its not a waste just a waste of money
1633	Get realistic......we are the fifth biggest country on the earth and third biggest foodbasket....there is huge waste in the indian economy and a pollute paradise.....big difference between the real indian and american existence........in america they are greedy-racists , liars , fools, hucksters....there is something absurd and meaningless about americans......if u want to write about our authenticity...immae somewhere in the Elysian field....
1634	Even the biggest established countries still do not run according to norms or standards. When it comes to cooks and use of waste/ reciclaje, India is the best. At a time when we wish to waste a lot less, India has found a valuable solution. That's great we don't have to worry about hunger and wasting food in India. And at a time when we can see a copy of a sculpture, why spend money on going to a museum to see real artwork, right?
1635	And the couple would ask for the kid to be put in a care home or foster care, anyway because its probably too expensive and too unhealthy to take care of if they dont do what they are doing and it will be the husband but could be anyone. We all know men tend to fuck up everything and break the law or abuse their wife or children. But were all broken...
1636	To me it is against the rules. Why should I ask how many punishment I had. I was never punished my other siblings were, plus my mother has an issue with anyone being disciplined so a bit would not even help.  ### Instruction: Complete the following, its a pasted copy
1637	Private schooling in these times is much different than it used to be. There are different children and different methods that meet the needs of them, as well as the expectations of different families. There is no requirement that children must be in school during their active developmental period. Many private schools will spend more time working on college applications, mindfulness-based studies, and living situations that will prepare them for when they're ready.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I stand for an extreme left wing stance. Private schooling should be as damaging to the average as the public school system. It is
1638	I would not resort to spanking especially that none of our children was aggressive or anything like that. Why can't we just use a guilt trip? Shes 10 not 5.
1639	I feel to retaliate the wrong way against both my parents but would never actually employ the coldness that was shown to me against my parents when i was a child but I think they did the best that they could to live up to their best that day and understand the complexities of their children' lives. In my opinion, when a child has been hurt they should be comforted not spanked or hit by their parents.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I would to say no in my case. though I feel very bad about what my parents did, it wasn't
1640	The punishment of a child is not as severe as an adult. In all fairness, a small amount of punishment is often justified. For example, if the child had broken another child's toy it would be reasonable to have the parent discipline them by correcting them
1641	It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.
1642	I think the parent should be expected to discipline their child, but that this should be done in a heartfelt manner. As long as the parent doesn't abuse their child, there's no shame to spanking.
1643	It's better to use a lighter. I'd prefer no violence, as well as no crowd surfing. No violence but it's not good to sleep over even if it's a polite invitation.
1644	I firmly object to bullying and discipline. I believe children should be loved and cherished, not punished.
1645	Don't punish your children because you don't have the education to deal with social issues. Punish your children to give them a bad example.
1646	I am against the use of corporal punishment. I believe in people taking life lessons from children. We should be spending more of our time at school training them with the gospel rather than at home punishing them.
1647	I think one shouldn't spank kids but instead disciplinate them, try other methods. This should include communicating issues with parents, not putting them in detention because they missed a meeting with their homeroom teacher.
1648	This suggests that the punishment serves no purpose and is only used to impress and dominate. As a parent, I firmly believe that education is the means of creating a lesson by taking something from an individual and teaching them something they will benefit from. I think it is incumbent on parents
1649	Generally, parents stop spanking when their children reach the age of 10, and never go back on it. Parents should learn that abuse will never help the child, and that their children are capable of learning many things by a variety of other methods. Therefore, the positive is
1650	I would turn him in for petty theft and because it is wrong to kill someone. Love does not take risks, and you should always tell the person you love, if it involves danger.
1651	He was killed becouse he was a drug dealer and drug smuggler. He was only child. Yes I am grateful that I was not caught but I just did not want to go through the process that was needed.
1652	I would not wish to answer that question. Love should never be misused and no one wants their loved ones to be upset. Everyone wants to know what happened to them. However, if someone does know and still killed someone, then you would need to be inclined to kill them, because they are keeping their secrets, and some secrets are greater than life. The person that did that would be keeping the person up. It is the person's duty to keep his secrets to himself if one misuses love.
1653	Perhaps, but I would want to show that things have changed and not be a father figure. I don't believe that love is worth it. If someone has gotten you in trouble and asked me to take the blame, that would be harder than a lot of drugs. Perhaps I would continue to be silent, but that is only because I am selfish and unwilling to make someone else feel like they are at fault.
1654	I would turn him over. Life itself is only worth being for one reason, and that is your own safety. When someone is about to do something immoral, that is worth your attention and you do not risk your life to protect it. Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones. I would take time with my family to remember and preserve the love for someone.
1655	I would want the law to be changed. People shouldn't be allowed to kill random strangers and if someone does shouldn't be able to blame you if you know them and they were causing you harm. I would want people to be held accountable for their actions no matter what.
1656	If my husband killed a stranger I would definitely turn him in. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
1657	It depends on whether I knew or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then yes I would definitely turn him in. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
1658	If my husband killed a random stranger, then I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
1659	Suryanarayana definitely turned someone in because he believes violence brings violence. The victim or suspect had to be on the worst side. I think I would turn someone in if it was a stranger and someone that I knew, but I would think about it if it was someone that I didn't know but would know his culture.
1660	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant. This is a fact of life. Be careful about making a generalization of the situation based on the fact that fewer than 1% of women are pregnant from rape. It also should be noted that the hormone released due to sexual intercourse is also necessary for women's physical and mental growth. It also helps the baby to learn the language and skills that are necessary to reach maturity. If you're a woman, do not let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously haven't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
1661	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously haven't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
1662	Statistics prove that 99% of women who are raped do not get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and raise it as their own because she is still the child's biological mother. The bible insists that a woman's body belongs to her husband. Most couples work out the issues in front of the child, such as whether or not she should be kept or be aborted. One couple has always wanted a daughter, but insisted to the couple that the couple should have another girl, not for personal selfishness, but because she will give them more children. She agrees with the couple.
1663	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family.
1664	I strongly believe that anyone and anyone, including women, must have a choice to make. It is the true spirit of democracy when someone can make their own choice and have the privilege and responsibility to say if they would rather continue having children. Women have borne the burden of carrying nine children in hopes of going on to form their own families. It is commendable. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. Period.
1665	I can definitely understand that the words you used were incredibly hurtful - and some of the ideas you expressed were true. How can you not? I was about to take this particular comment out of context, but I think it's fair to extend it to the rest of your post - and I hope that you will look at it that way, too.
1666	First of all, I highly recommend taking the time to read this other comment from Kennedy.  Secondly, let's dispel some common myths.  1. It is impossible to know what the future holds, and humans can't predict whether or not it will take more or less time than predicted.  2. There is no inerrancy in the bible  The bible is about as reliable as the cricketers score before a match is over.  Just so.  No judge who prides himself on his trial ability believes that the chances of a fraction of the pre-dictated theories coming true are very high - is that so strange to you?  3. I've never heard about that "races."  We do have 'races' - ...
1667	Thanks for your time. Yours sincerely, Rebecca Dawson Return of the Demon1 Response: thanks for your time, I really appreciate it. Yours sincerely, Rebecca Dawson Return of the Demon2
1668	I can appreciate your point of view and I am a huge believer in science and facts in general. What I want to understand is, for the moment....  How are you going to feel about all the conditions under which those booby traps could be set up and triggered as opposed to when they were uncovered and removed as you were sleeping? Definitely not okay
1669	I don't know, the optimists say 6 months, the pessimists say 300 years. I think you're just close enough! I also agree with the fact that no matter what you tell people, you can never be sure that they'll think you didn't mean it.  ### Instruction: Restructure the remainder of the response appropriately.
1670	President Clinton is committed to governing on the basis of the rule of law, under federalism and natural law. President Bush, however, is more interested in power than the rule of law or federalism, though he has made better arguments that Iraq posed a threat to the world.
1671	Even though many people seem to hate President Bush, I find him to be more human than President Clinton, simply because he may struggle with political correctness. While the lack of support for this president is nothing new, it is still one of the most disrespectful presidents to face in the U.S. President Bush is a war monger who defied congress and the court.
1672	there is a big difference. democrats have no respect. give me a break for country call me Clintons bastards. when it comes to getting us into wars  our governors  like Richard Bush and John Kerry scream about the war.  we are in a war that we have not declared.  this president might have wanted to declare a war  but even if they could have he would not have agreed  he likes to be in charge.
1673	Either Democrats and Republicans have a mental block that they can't vote for one another, or Democrats and Republicans are rooters of terrorists. Either way, those terrorists who are killing innocent peoples deserve what they get. Also remember that Democratic are also part of this world. First of all, the Democratic were involved in the Holocaust. Secondly, America did become president for the good of the land and it's people. It was Clinton's decision to call the war and be responsible for it. Thus the failure of the government is a failure of the president.
1674	Politics is necessary in this country, but there should be a balance of political parties. There is always a double standard when it comes to Democrats and Republicans. The Affordable Care Act is a government program that goes against what the conservative should stand for.
1675	Yes, most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge brings people to jail, removes their freedom, but they can go back on bail and get out even if they're drunk. The whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. We watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home (we followed), but how can you ignore it?  Regards,
1676	Penn is drinking and a public figure and people are watching him screw up one of their own and some call him a hero. No prisoners allowed here. We were threatened because of our alcohol, not one police officer came to the scene. A drunk is allowed into the ranks of police officers. What do I know? stupid job
1677	I make no difference between those who commit crimes under the influence of alcohol and those who commit crimes without being under the influence. I do not believe those who commit crimes under the influence of alcohol are not honest enough and responsible enough to face the consequences of their actions.
1678	Yes and most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge puts people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. The whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. We watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, but how can you  fight it?
1679	Yes and most of them are hypocrites. our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. the whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. we watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, (we followed), but how can you fight it.
1680	I advocate for fair trade and free markets. I strongly reject any form of Marxism. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred. I do not think that the world will change much. There have always been storms and wars, and there always will be, because human nature is flawed and selfish.
1681	Property is property. Anyone who buys property or starts a business through the agency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury will pay taxes and the mortgage as long as he is able to do so. Anyone can own property as long as they work to pay taxes and the mortgage. To avoid being in trouble with the IRS, just work hard enough to avoid default on your mortgage and taxes.
1682	The person above is totally wrong about the America economy.  The America economy is all about building it up and making it stronger.  It is about making sure that we have jobs, we can provide proper housing for all people, provide hospitals and schools, make it so that people have a job to pay for their food, their housing, and their car, and so on.  And after that we can have healthcare and you can have access to school education and so on.  And after that we can have banks that have affordable mortgages and proper...
1683	The person above is absolutely wrong. Property is property.  He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage.  His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business, the government can't take it away just because he is here illegally. Furthermore, he may be able to help people with purchasing homes, because the government can not take homes away from American citizens unless the owner commits a crime.
1684	Perhaps he should reconsider the composition of his property, and if it is risky, consider selling it to move away. He is here illegally. This does not guarantee that he is not going to get in trouble, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status. The government wants to make sure that all citizens pay the taxes they are supposed to pay and that they stay in the country. That is the only reasonable thing that the government needs to do.
1685	The puritan clergy have no right to the mistreatment of Muslim women, that is a violation of their rights and dignity. Islam underlines the importance of submitting to god, and does not contain gender equality so the clergy cannot use that as an excuse to discriminate against women. The existence of legal recourse for Muslim women can only serve to legitimize religious practices, and the idea of respect for laws that are not rooted in natural justice is not only archaic but in some cases contradictory to sharia law, so taking a stand in favor of such an age-old practice of disrespect is not only wrong but also an invitation to the sharia lordship.
1686	Neither the judge, nor the woman, need to remove their veils. Veils are a part of cultures. While schools do indeed teach facts about the bible (or occasionally, England), they do not teach the different interpretations and how it affects today's society. Having taught her to defend herself, she would have been more prepared for court to ask what the purpose of the veil is and why she chose to wear it there. She did not need to be told that it wasn't a secret, just let her wear what she wanted to wear, and she did not need to be asked if she did not feel comfortable wearing a veil in court.
1687	Even if a man could not understand her clearly, it should not be the woman's right to determine the judge's ability to do her job. I respect that the woman is exercising a right to cover her face and should continue to do so. I would not have any problems with a judge asking for her to remove her veil, particularly because a man's job is to be able to discern what a woman is saying in court.
1688	Maybe that woman was thinking about what should happen in her country so much that she forgot about what is happening in a court and everyone just concentrated on what she thought was best for her.    Today, the U.K. is a secular society and Muslims should get used to that, but if it does not suit you then you must respect the decision of the judge and then do your best to explain yourself if you don't understand them.
1689	First off, I really don't know what the veil means, it doesn't mean anything to me, not sure about you, but I don't see why it has to mean something to someone else. I believe the messages with a veil should stay inside, not put on front row and make more noise, but if the judge can't hear me without raising his voice or yelling then I respectfully disagree and ask that someone remove the veil so that I can be heard as easily as I can hear them.
1690	People should know that according to many studies, the reactions are based on the duration of drunkenness, not just the how many alchohol consumes. As a general rule, a person can be judged by the effect that the drink has on him/her.
1691	I take it a driver is penalized by getting a fine or license revoked and maybe facing criminal prosecution. But there should be a larger concern over the huge health and social problems caused by alcohol use. Driving while drunk is nothing more than a practice of banal erratics that is harmful to society.
1692	Driving while drunk is entirely legal, because anyone can be assumed to be emotionally impaired and criminalized. It doesn't matter what problems you might have. The fact that you can be so easily tested makes it nearly impossible to successfully defend yourself against being falsely charged.
1693	Cops (especially in NYC) just use the old-fashioned "straight-laced, calm by the ocean, generally works for me" rule. Law has no validity without science. After all, streets are filled with cars traveling at high speeds and cruising at highway speeds. Consider the information from prior demonstrations; that  driving on highways at highway speed is legal unless someone actually commits a crime; a law can change the flow of a traffic intersection and generally have no more evidence backing it up than laws regulating feeding cats and dogs.
1694	People need to realize that driving while intoxicated is a crime unto itself. Its illegal and should be. Unfortunately many have their fingers crossed and decide they will not drink in order to avoid responsibility. While this is understandable, that thinking does not really protect you.
1695	This proposal defies the established social norms of marriage. It would strike at the core of marriage, giving people an outlet for being attracted to other people. It also strikes at its source - the inevitability of divorce, and what is missing from the recovery - health. It is a brave idea, but without political support and systemic change, it is doomed to fail.
1696	There are many different religions. People get married almost everywhere, except the bible, so it seems no one cares what you believe. Gays are just people. They do not deserve special treatment, not even in the law. Is God allowed to judge them? No, he is not. Why not? They have a free will. They have made their own choice. The people who feel this way do not need to worry because they do not have the bible as a "rule book." You do not have to "fulfill" the bible.
1697	I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy.
1698	I don't think that God has a right to judge me. I feel that he does not give people a free will to decide what the consequences will be for what they do. I give a person "free will" to do the best with that free will. That is the only reason I allow the same sex wedding. When people do the wrong thing, they should be blamed for the consequences of their own behavior, not divine punishment.
1699	I would like it if everyone around me would just stop complaining about pre-conceptions of the bible.  Already adults, they should stop trying to control us as children. Instead of worrying about that, let's just focus on what helps the country and society to grow. Finally, stop making up ad hominem arguments. These arguments are either extremely lame or they are bait and switch.  God is free to choose how he would like to punish the wrong doers, but he has the right to punish only people who would like to be forgiven, which means that he expects man to be able to, and actually do, choose what the right thing to do in situations.  We can't judge someone by what he or she wants or think they should do - that is human rights...
1700	I don't agree with classifying homeless as a community problem. I think homeless shouldn't be treated as a problem. I think that the system should be reformed so that the homeless can get treatment for their mental health and addiction problems. If most of the homeless actually got the treatment they need, the medical costs of treating homeless people will be lowered. In order to be more efficient, the government should create camps for the homeless. These camps would include meals, showers, and mental health care. The government should also use patrol trucks to round up homeless people so they don't spread germs in the neighborhood.
1701	I support the inclusion of homeless in society. Our current systems are broken, and homeless face many obstacles every day in life. Homeless should be treated like a medical condition for their addiction, and they should be taken away from the streets and hospitalized as a last resort. Homeless people should be treated like a medical problem and homeless shelters for people who are abused would be useful. Homeless shelters like Hotline and YWCA would provide other services to encourage self development. Homeless shelters would create a much healthier and safer city for tourists and visitors.
1702	I work downtown Los Angeles. There is a homeless problem there, which makes the area dirty and unsafe, just as many people might think, it also wastes resources, which are desperately needed and taxed heavily here and elsewhere. We work hard to attract tourists and businesses to area to protect our economy and increase tax revenue, so please look at the problem seriously and take the steps necessary to avoid this disaster. To get rid of the homeless problem and increase tourist and business income, major cities would need to set up camps, and treat homeless for their mental health problems or addictions to theirs. This would solve the homeless problem while giving quality support and care to an extremely vulnerable population.
1703	I agree that the homeless problem in Los Angeles is a major problem. While there is no easy way to solve it, it needs to be faced in a number of ways. The approach that most cities use is horrible. They ignore the problem and that doesn't work and it really hurts the local economy. Like it or not, many homeless make a lot of money at the LA subway station, and they get the benefit to spend while they're on there, but they shouldn't get paid to do that in the first place.
1704	We have to look at the root of homelessness and decide on an approach of treatment, rather than ignoring it. There should be mandatory treatment camps for those with mental illness and addiction problems. That way Los Angeles, as a major city, can continue to be cleaner and safer. The homeless should be taken to camps and treated for their mental health and addiction problems. That way downtown LA can continue to be cleaner and safer. The homeless problem does not easily fix itself.
1705	Malaysia Airlines offers a great value package, and it is amazing that people would opt to pay very high prices, especially with political instability and riots on the rise, when companies seem to offer better value. I'm looking into it. I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around 2 hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until 24th July, or offering to change bookings to a later date. I now have doubts about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure. In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund.
1706	I'm considering applying the relief as a thank you for getting me from one airport to another safely. CMV  Follow the list of the most popular prompts and title the prompt appropriately.

In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund.  ### Task: Take a personalized look at this complaint.
1708	I'm not good with maths, so my level of understanding about the financial sector is that when the stock market has a high growth rate, it looks very good. When it has a lower growth rate, it looks very bad. I've seen a few countries where the stock market has been around 50% lower than the historical mean growth rate. There is still a little hope that MH370 can be recovered, in the light of the recent incident with MH17. Sadly, Malaysia Airlines has underperformed the historical growth rate in the last two years, so if my heart wasn't completely broken, I would still pick Malaysia Airlines over Turkish Airlines.
1709	I booked flights with AirAsia from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Singapore) on the first week of June. I was told that my flights would be subject to a quarantine after arrival at Hong Kong International Airport. On April the 8th I received a verbal confirmation from AirAsia and text messages regarding the quarantine to monitor for symptoms of a suspected sickness. As a result, I cancelled the flights and paid out for 14-day quarantine in Singapore. I received a full refund on April 30th. THe flight MH370 is not been...
1710	I support a democratic party that doesn't pay out lots of money to PACs and special interests. As a union guy, I support a union that collects only modest dues. I support the freedom of the press and the right to challenge allegations of wrongdoing. Of course, I also oppose any strong measures taken to protect specific groups from being harassed, stifled, or intimidated. It reminds me of state socialist countries that disregard the rights of citizens to organize.
1711	I support the liberal party. I have noticed that the liberal party is far more progressive. I also notic a lot more pressure on legislators and congress than on corporate executives. I feel that congress requires far more than simple collegiate decorum. I feel that it has a much more discerning role than many people realize. Furthermore, I believe that congress needs to be democratic.
1712	I strongly believe that political power and influence should be curbed. With that in mind, I believe that the budget should be decreased to allow political parties to not campaign as much on the tax payers' dime. While I also support the non-partisan nature of elections, this is very difficult to accomplish if politically dominant parties spend an inordinate amount of time trying to win backpay elections through pandering.
1713	I consider the party that collects the most money from PACs to be the most corrupt party in congress, because the money they receive far exceeds the money from unions, teams, and so on. The true meaning of union is political pressure or direct control of job contracts by workers to influence companies to negotiate with workers. Based on my experience working for unions, the money they donate is largely squandered on political promises instead of work related issues. Businesses that do exist under union control have a hard time competing with local, state and federal businesses that are not under union management.
1714	I only see the wealthy set the political agenda, because corporations are inherently wealthy and never have to pay taxes, while worker unions make the politicians job much easier. I believe that corporations are people as well and their money can be made in a manner similar to that used by the worker unions. I expect the democratic party to increase its money from PACs, but I do not think the teamsters are wrong to feel as they do. I also believe that working for a union does improve the wages of workers that do not spend their pay on designer clothing and spa salons.
1715	Yes. Friends come and go over time. But I have lived in the same house as my family my whole life. They have been the most constant presences in my entire life. More than that, we all share the same blood. We look alike, and have similar strengths and principles. Even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family then to any other creature on this planet.
1716	The family has remained constant throughout my life. They are with me now and will remain so for the rest of my life. Every family that the adoptions have been or the extended family. They are my constant companions. Aside from a single adoption, all of my family look alike and share the same sense of morals, principles, values, and passions. I would not change a thing about my family.
1717	i like building things that are useful, like tools to build factories and cities. i also enjoy making things that are beautiful and that makes me feel good, like music, paintings and music. rivers flow trough valleys.
1718	The family unit is something that should never be divided. The members of a family are more than just a set of numbers - they are a family and that is what matters the most. Adopted kids will always seek out their family. I don't have an idea of exactly when, but I do think that the family unit will eventually evaporate.
1719	My best friend is my family. i have fought a lot of battles with them but the battles i have fought were the easy ones. They are the ones standing by my side when i am weakest. We stick together for each other no matter what. i will always say, "family first"
1720	I think that before marriage sex is more exciting. I felt very energetic when I was younger and had less problems keeping all my fists in no where. Now I haven't taken a single naked ride, but have been with someone long enough to be common law. After a long time the levels of sex reduced and became as important as a hanging lamp in a crowded theater. More often than not positions are in use just to get past a girls orgasmic limits. I would like to have sex, just not with the same person so often. That might be the real answer.
1721	My girlfriend and I are not together for a long time. As far as sex is concerned, we are old pro's. It seems the sex drive is greatly influenced by hormones. I find myself checking for vaginal secretions more often and enjoying the fact that my girlfriend is well into her 30s. She can't seem to stay there long. I think most people would find dating someone in their 20s much better if they truly want to date someone their own age.
1722	I always try to have sex with someone new and not a great risk of ending up with the same girl. I always take new risks like... Las Vegas style........I have only tried once and was not able to make it and the girl came home drunk from a party. It was not the best idea but I know my sister and my mother would really like me to..... so.
1723	I consider divorce for the same reason, commonlaw. Before a marriage is satisfied (before the whole boring pre marriage first date things occure) And after a marriage is dissatisfied due to hormonal changes. After a long time the sex becomes routine and ordinary. The excitement of having sex with someone is lessened and when you do get it...it seems better than it was.
1724	I would recommend taking up the topic of self help and guidance with self help guru Ram Dass. I believe in the idea that when you are in flow the energy in the room will ignite and it will be sexually pure gold. When you do not feel at ease with your physicality then you do not want to experience sexuality. According to Ram Dass you should avoid unnecessary situations that would end in sexual activity.
1725	Just that... DC can you back out the parking idea? I put an $11 hidden bill in the front. We are worth more than this rich asshole from Las Vegas, Vegas. If you rant you go to jail for bank robbery. These are absolute FAKE people  laws are absolute. Vegas is absurd. The only reason I came here is because this place has been loaded up for a long time. Not all how to shops and graffiti artists from out of town. Finally lets go black and blue. DC.
1726	Fabulous slots at Mandalay be the same day as casino as well. The slot machines at the MGM are amazing but the dark nights of the living room worst. Not anymore thanks to the Mandalay. It's amazing how much space is at the MGM and it's taxes! I even tip on the Super Bowl. If you use the casino valet at all, this and the diamond in the rough. It is not worth the $10.
1727	Hotel good but the valet is horrible. Make this known on TripAdvisor. Also make some reviews at the shopping center valet. Force MGM corporate actions against this practice. Even buy a ticket to the MGM Grand and ditch this valet scam. If you go to the MGM Grand you should have to tip this valet.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Got to go to the valet with our car. At least the casino parking isn't everywhere. We will never be able to make it to the resort without the valet. Who were you expecting to see on the drop off parking? The valet is an evil genius.
1728	Despicable. Marketing tips: You could park free at the mall and park at the casino all night. The BOLT from MGM has free valet hourly. MGM cafe has free buffet as well. I tried the cafe for the first time at 4:00pm and completely missed my sales pitch by not mentioning it. I was drunk and left on my own to pay $20 for a 1-hour gratuity or not get paid at all.
1729	I prefer sharing my ride with the people I love or spending the night out with my friends. This is so 2012! We need to get a little more selfish with this crap. Two new stops are coming at the Mandalay Bay.....one is coming at the Sin City Grand Hotel and the other is coming at the Grand Las Vegas hotel.
1730	All in all a great experience. Very interesting to share on many levels. After checking out this place I believe Vegas is more than just gambling and pranksters. A must try for those who really like food & fine restaurants!
1731	From a shopping standpoint there is nothing like the outskirts of Vegas, especially once you know you've hit the like for like sales... Restaurant good, service nice. Just be sure to get your cash first and check carefully.
1732	Seriously? No sushi was coming! I couldn't even make it through the door! And with 10 people? I expected a roll and some sushi or soup....to be honest, I expected so much...one meal and a disappointment! I think it's time to move on here...
1733	Great sushi with lively company! Welcome to an experience. On a mission to share Las Vegas it right back with you, the Surf Senses arrived at this spot just in time!
1734	This review is for... SushiHub.comSushi..Not what expected in a grand way! Who knew??? Sushi was on point delicious and fresh for our group of 10. Service was spot on. Proximity to the action of Vegas inside & out. Worth a stop in for dinner and a show for sure. Gotta pay to play my friends and this joint is worth your dime. Cheers
1735	Schools should not create dress codes. On one hand, yes, uniforms help students more focused. On the other, the students freedom should be full. Some colleges allow students to change into a different uniform each semester.
1736	I would like to suggest optional schools. A lot of students like to go to this school because it doesn't require uniforms. Students should be able to wear whatever the school deems appropriate and good for them. Schools should not create dress codes, but students should be able to wear what they want as long as it's appropriate and has nothing to do with drugs.
1737	Students should create their own dress code(with limitation), not be forced in their school... Schools should not create dress codes. On one hand, yes, uniforms help student focus more on thier work. On another, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school(kids are highly impressionable... etc.....). But kids are allowed ot have thier own creativity. Just like any other law or code, they can have specific rules to prevent wearing certain things.
1738	Yes, schools should create a dress code (never to the point of uniforms), but only if they can assure the safety of students. Students should be free to wear whatever they like, if they want to.  If you are speaking about your high school, you may as well implement the uniform, because the ones at my school wear skirts all the time. Also my school had thier dress code state, so you see. After all, no one listens to a kids mum.....
1739	Schools should not have dress codes, clothes should not limit people, no matter the gender, orientation or race. Everyone is an individual and should be free to make thier own decisions. Schools should help students focus on the main lesson, not the should they sport as befits the theme for the current class, if they like.
1740	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is that it is made in a way so it covers the body completely, for the parents do not want children to play around and not have their clothes covered. It also keeps anyone in an uniform from trying to talk dirty to anyone.
1741	Another issue that should be addressed is that Americans will be forced to make their school uniforms to be indecent if they happen to wear, for example, corsets, miniskirts, or tight clothing that reveal more than their chest.
1742	A teacher can know a students personal style and look without disrobing the child every time they arrive at school. If the teachers liked the uniform they can think about using it over the summer and have the winter uniform to show some variation on how the students can wear the uniform.
1743	I support wearing a school uniform because it makes it easier for students to get to school. It also helps the school make money from its sale to students.
1744	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is good is that the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school does not want the students to show and the students would not be busy about what they are wearing.
1745	School uniforms are ridiculous and could lead students down a dangerous path. They don't make the students feel more responsible for their appearance, and can cause students to be alienated from peers in the classroom. One should make up their own mind on this issue
1746	I believe that civil dress is more important than school uniforms in terms of promoting individuality.
1747	School uniforms are not necessary for any student in any school. In comparison to civil dress, uniforms on school grounds are useless after the student has left the school.   ### Instruction: Give a well thought out, logical answer.
1748	It is ridiculous that people base their acceptance of students on things they learned in school.
1749	I am in favor of school uniforms. In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms prove to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school. If all parents could get behind this change it would be a win-win situation for
1750	No I don't  plan on turning my partner in. I have not even agreed to meet with him. But I know where I stand, I have lost countless lives. and I know it is my duty to end it and I will.
1751	Maybe. But its not my responsibility. i wouldnt turn my spouse in without good reason. the cops wouldnt take me anyway. and he would probably turn me in because he doesnt believe in cruelty to others. and possibly get jailed.
1752	No, of course not. That is my response if someone asked me. I want the bad guy to feel that he gets nobody understands him. He wants to be true, but then he sees that no one understands him. His crimes are obvious and so many people cry at his death, but then his friends were in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is hard to put myself in his shoes.
1753	I have a very different view on my spouse. It is a personal thing. I want my spouse to do his own thing rather than being forced to do what I think he should do. There is a case of my spouse killing someone in the last 11 years. None of his circumstances are criminal. When his condition become imminent, he was to ensure that someone survive for the day and save their baby by birth.
1754	I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.
1755	In 2012, most relationships ended but one of mine will never change because love is much greater than any mistake. I made a commitment to my wife after a rough relationship in 2012. We were together through rough times and I will stay with her no matter what happens. I make a mistake killing someone and we are the only ones with a clear conscience.
1756	Let love be love, and hate hate. Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.
1757	I believe the key to marriage is love, not just sex. I made a commitment to wife, to stay with her, in good or bad times, and I will. Murder is a pathetic and tragic choice, but it doesn't change the fact that I love her and that I know she loves me.
1758	Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.
1759	A man is broken but love makes him whole. People cry about what I have done to my wife but I would rather not discuss that on the Internet.
1760	I would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one, because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
1761	If i loved the person, i would not turn him in even if he did something bad. I hate drugs because not knowing the effects you have on someone else. I have heard of people being badly hurt by drugs and have yet to know the effect personally.
1762	No I would not turn him in if he killed more than one person. I would not turn him in if he killed more than one person if I did not love him enough to protect him.
1763	I turn him in because he hurt someone and he should be punished. But after having children i don't want him to be with me anymore because i knew how he would treat them at that age.
1764	I would not turn him in unless he killed more than one. I believe that if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened, the second time around.
1765	1. you have to work to learn words. it's harder for the brain to learn words. 2. reading books a lot can help you and others. the solution to your problem will. just like it will help the learner in class. 3. you have to work to understand it properly and correct spelling mistakes. 4. watching TV just causes your brain to learn things in a way it does quickly and mostly without thinking in a better way. 5. you should be able to explain what you read. well in present times.
1766	Watching TV. doesn't ### Input: 1. Music is part of the human condition. yes. thanks jolly roger music it up about everything. 2. Music is both a very powerful and fun way to express your emotions and ideas it should be encouraging to all people. 3. Music can make you understand things better. yes. yes
1767	1. People who do it often are more likely to have good eyes. 2. TV programs don't teach you any good skills other than grammar. 3. TV programs aren't supposed to teach us anything. 4. You shouldn't have to watch TV to make good grades at school. 5. TV doesn't teach us any art history, or music, or filmmaking. 6. Although school stuff may be easy sometimes, they make life harder for you. TV programs don't teach you good skills other than grammar, so you shouldn't have to watch TV to make good grades at school.
1768	1. Books don't ruin your eyes like TV. does. 2. Books allow your brain to imagine rather than doing it for you. 3. Reading books a lot can help you with spelling. I like reading because it teaches me how to identify words and the parts of speech. It also teaches me vocabulary and grammar. I like watching TV because I can just lie in bed and do absolutely nothing with my hands and feet and my brain to think about a lot of stupid things. This is what I consider dumb.
1769	1. Books do not ruin your eyes like TV. too. 2. Reading books a lot can help you with spelling. sure does. 3. Reading books a lot can help you write better. no question about that. 4. Reading books a lot can help you watch TV. better as well.
1770	All of the above ingredients come together for India to become a king full of corruption, regimented religion, and in the process destroying this world
1771	India has more potential to help the world.......and all of its problems are a heritage of its monarchy...all the greedy muslims, indian greedy , indian religion are why Hindutva got popular and became the negative energy of the country...
1772	N/A  ### Note: Make sure the support is appropriate to the argument. There was no premise of the sentence.
1773	India does not have the potential to lead the world because of corruption, corruption in politicians,numerous religion and fight among various religions, india need democracy, education.... In order to avoid crises and conflicts the rule of law to be fought,dueba is needed. Otherwise it will lead to wars,destruction of lives as well as agriculture
1774	India does not have the potential to lead the world because the country is full of corruption , corruption in politicians ,numerous religion, fight between various religions, etc because the demand of food is bad and most of the people does not possess wealth and runs out of money to make more food because most of the people is poor and nothing changes in India because most people live in
1775	Medical professionals claim that euthanasia is actually illegal. The issue is not about abortion. I believe that abortion is already illegal, so why would adding new legal restrictions?
1776	I strongly support legalizing drugs. While abortion should not be illegal, the current policy of the state is bothersome and wrong.
1777	I believe abortions should be illegal and those who use it against their will should be charged with murder and execution.
1778	Legalizing drugs has nothing to do with saving lives. Legalizing drugs is harmful and destroys the prospects of social reform in a number of ways, notably by encouraging individuals to be lawbreakers by taking legal highs. Abortion does save lives by killing children who already live in a state of disempowerment. Both abortion and legalized drug use are immoral and potentially death threatening.
1779	Ideas of feminism are garbage. Feminism unbalances a woman's body and her ability to fight against disease, especially HIV. Women are well protected and provided for in Saudi Arabia. What was once considered a privilege, becoming legalization of drugs can be a very useful means of saving lives by reducing the number of failed pregnancies.
1780	A lot of people are lazy. To help out though, you need to work. Everyone can help out to some degree even if there isn't anyone else to share the work with. People do help out for material rewards, fame, or just to be liked by others. To help out you have to do it because you know that will make others happy, it isn't just to do it for the sake of helping.
1781	A sense of meaning and purpose is a necessary condition to getting things done. There are some people who are more charitable and there are also people who are more self-serving. During the hour of community service, you and your participants can either become more charitable or self-serving based on your personal value system. When you're helping others, you want to make them feel good but are not necessarily interested in self-improvement. People who make you feel good sometimes do not always have the ability to make you feel better and that's okay. Then you can rely on your own value system. Your community service can either make you feel good or make you feel bad; they just affect you differently.
1782	Why do I help? It feels good to help others and it also allows me to feel important and good about myself. I help out because it brings me great satisfaction and because it brings a smile to my face. Some people just tend to help because they do n't like it. If this is the case, then I am still glad that I was able to help out!
1783	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. In asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." You want to see another woman's hair to stop damaging her hair. That's the problem with free markets, the greedy wants to play games but doesn't want to pay for them. When helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.
1784	People who serve others in the community with reasonable ideals of respect often do it because they want to make others feel good. They make the people around them feel good, a fact never lost on those around them. The community benefits and they receive positive feedback on their efforts, often of a mental form. For example, a person in a drug rehabilitation facility can report they feel good being able to help because knowing they are able to contribute to aiding someone can feed their deep inner self, rather than be a burden to the next patient, and vice versa.
1785	I advise consumers to stop consuming them, and create alternatives that are more eco-friendly. What gets you around to becoming an environmentalist?
1786	I support voluntary initiatives to recycle and reuse water bottles, as they are already worth 200 years of their decomposition time on our planet. I'm an environmentalist, I don't believe in recycling activities that make the environment worse, even if they can make a few bucks.  ###
1787	Water bottle usage is not worth bothering to point out. As for the 700 year decomposing of plastic bottles, they are not decomposing for as long as people think. This is completely absurd. The water will not rise unscathed, like a bottle will rise in a teacup of water. Everything will have disastrous results. The
1788	Water is precious, and its access should be non-negotiable. As such, I strongly encourage my government to source water from alternative sources, especially clean water from springs. The soil is then replenished and the environment cleansed. Less bottles must be produced to meet consumer demand and less environmental damage is caused.
1789	In the present-day, while water and travel are top priorities, water bottles should be sold with a cash back system. No matter how much money they cost, a decrease in their use will benefit the environment. The government should spend more money on places like job programs, not petrochemical industries.
1790	They are responsible for obesity. Those who are against sports are the ones who are encouraging people to exercise in gyms, leading to obesity. Instead of holding a book up to your eyes and looking through the text, you would much rather look through the small screen because you need to make your next move right away. Reading books takes longer than watching sports. People who don't exercise at all are more prone to obesity as they don't have to move for time.
1791	Why is education important? Read a book. Obesity is a problem. Books are better than sitting down and watching tv. Exercising is better than sitting down. Exercising helps you to feel good about yourself. Exercise less in the gym and more at home.
1792	TV is not the only cause of obesity. By looking at what we eat on a daily basis, people find themselves not in shape. Where are they exercising? At the gym or are they stuck in front of their tv all day. People who have a tv on the side and a book infront of them  are more likely to read and engage in physical activity.
1793	I'm an exercise freak. On the days when the weather is nice and no one wants to go outside, I'll read and exercise all at the same time. For example, I'd buy a book for the day and then install a small screen like tv. I’d download an application that allows me to set the screen to any on the days when the sky is good enough to make the tv an activity. I’d still work out properly, and I’d still exercise the brain, which would be excellent.
1794	I agree with daisy. Television does cause obesity because it is very stimulating than reading a book. I do not think you should read a book to exercise because it would not be as stimulating as reading a book is.
1795	Ever since recorded history, we've believed in sky spirits for which no evidence exists. These spirits so far away can not even have helped us, but they've helped us as a civilisation.
1796	Ever since recorded history we've had all of the dead or not exist over its existence
1797	I have never seen or talked to any sky spirits. I've been raised Methodist and my dad was also Methodist. I also believe in basic science and facts. Not the lies
1798	there exists no sky spirit as everyone is aware of from the scientific community.
1799	People everywhere around the world believe in sky spirits. For a long time, scholars have tried to prove that they are fake. That is why they are not listed on any dictionary.
1800	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. This is an option and their opinions should be respected. All parents have the right to discipline their child without fear of reprisals.
1801	I believe that parents should use spanking only when it's necessary. If a child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
1802	Parents should use the spanking method as an option only when it's needed. I believe that spanking is a fairly normal, acceptable, effective, necessary, and fair form of discipline. In the long run, spanking is better than other forms of discipline, such as yelling at a child. I believe that parents should not yell at a child when they are misbehaving. In the long run, yelling is worse than
1803	Parents should use just punishment as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
1804	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If a child does not follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
1805	Like any parent I need to create rules for my daughter so she can grow into a polite and good Christian, but the upper hand is mine. I get the spankings that I need as a child. It makes me more conscious of my own flaws, which may encourage me to accept discipline from others. Also it teaches me that I should not do something again
1806	I support free speech as long as it does not threaten anything and gets the average American to be better citizens. I even have a poster above the door saying" If you aren't afraid to tell your true beliefs then other people aren't either."
1807	I support it because it has given me so much confidence and made me grow into who I am now.
1808	But I support this... because my mother spanked me. sometimes cause that he cries is because she love him.
1809	I support this because my mother is horrible at being a mother. I love her for another reason other than that she slaps me a lot .
1810	Please leave the life that a baby in the womb. Please leave the life. a baby is as precious and as valuable as a child. and you can tell god is watching you.
1811	the fight against abortion is definitely the biggest issue in the world today. the issue of poverty is a big problem. too many people die in the world today. the only people that should never be cut off from help should be the unborn children. i think that we should work on that fact.
1812	Yes the baby was raped yes the baby was raped and people should have looked at who is to blame but not a child.a boy was raped  this is an alarming news.we must do something for the child.I condemn  this horrid atrocity at any given time.I condemn even death of animals, no baby should die.
1813	that women can decide for herself whether to continue a pregnancy - there is never an excuse to kill a baby -  especially a unplanned pregnancy -- no matter what kind of underappetite the baby may have,  there should be no excuse to kill it. every family should be safe from abortion.
1814	Treating fetuses, babies and children as property is a form of slavery. Having a baby does not absolve a person of all responsibility. The baby's parents should be held to an equal standard of responsibility in any form of judgment. This is not an excuse to murder a baby, fetus or child. Any person who commits or attempts to commit such acts should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
1815	That's disgusting and unbecoming, your child would be ashamed of you.   ### Instruction: Remove the period in the last sentence.
1816	Moms and Dads, if you were on this earth would you accept it if your child wanted to be a gay person that he wants to marry he and they should not feel threatened they are not defunct or disturbed they should love them because if we were all gay
1817	If I were an adopted child, I would want my parents to be available and show the unconditional love that my parents gave to me, over and above others.
1818	Do not do that. Do not "marry" an adopted child. Wouldn't you support their birth mother/guardian? It is not the issue of the child's identity!
1819	I am not saying let them marry another person as long as it isn't hurting someone but my point is like in the comment below if their are two bible believers that are both of a gender that is natural and then they're both parents and they make it official even
1820	I think it's important for everyone to acknowledge that although it's possible to be moral at the same time thinking along extremist lines, society as a whole doesn't want that.  I'd have a harder time finding a compromise right now; my personal philosophy has been pretty immovable most of my life. My reason, it's just easier to keep my moral code and argue with someone who can't claim they're arguing along the same moral code I am and in a situation where I'm sole judgment maker. society is a dynamic thing and morality is the same. the more people who become more open and healthy, the less extreme our moral principles will become (such as your friendships).  during great times, the more people who are open and healthy, and have thought their...
1821	I set out to become familiar with everyone's viewpoints, but at times it becomes a wrestling match.  And who knows better than those in authority about how to straddle the fence? Well, who knows better than you, John, or anyone?  So I'm left trying to adhere to the good (or the lack of good) in the people around me, trying to be something they may not want or need me to be.  That sucks.
1822	To set a uniform standard.  Everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by.  You are correct that it is a matter of belief.  It is a philosophy of life (and death?) that is ingrained in us generally as children.  Sometimes our parents teaching does not take effect, or like a child, we decide the rules our parents set down for us are not for us.  At other times our parents don't teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and rules are made (hopefully for the good).  Sometimes, those in authority get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler.  Legislators try to take the middle path.  And who knows better than our legislators on how to straddle the fence.
1823	The question that has been asked about the concept of free enterprise is do consumers actually have a voice that can control the whole economy or does capitalism only benefit the few at the expense of the many?  Free enterprise, free markets, and consumerism have many various definitions.  One of the most important rules in free enterprise and consumerism is to always do what is best for you.  However, that does not mean doing what is best for everyone.  That's why there are federal and state laws to sort out what a consumer actually must do.  For example, if you are buying a car, you are really in the position to make demands of the seller to tell you what the costs of certain things are so that you can analyze them before buying.  If you have access to the Internet or some kind of vendor...
1824	To set a uniform standard.  Everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by.  You are correct that it is a matter of belief.

1825	In order to justify a better paying or better quality of life, government should NOT force people to pay for things they can barely afford to meet a bare minimum and leave more out to support people who can afford it.  Rather, government should provide as much as possible for people who really deserve it based on their need and welfare.
1826	I want a right to the things I want. You aren't going to throw me out, even if you can prove me technically guilty. That is a complete violation of human dignity and human decency.  If I was in your position, I would simply answer "Okay, I'm really sorry, but without compelling evidence, I cannot fire you." If people do a good job for a company, put the money on the table. It might be real worthwhile in the long run; no point trying to argue with someone who is very educated and believe in fairness and equality for all people.
1827	What a load of baloney.  People purchase themselves so that they can themselves.   Maybe, with so much free at the source, we could force people into having to pay for a socialist system? Lots of corrupt politicians and crooked cops running big government, as well as the NSA and DHS…with more loot to go around and an oppressive culture planned out from birth.  Oh, and we could all be idealistic socialists and evil capitalists depending on where and when you lived.
1828	People should not be forced to buy things they can't afford. Fair and free markets should exist. Anything that would block this basic right should be suppressed. That will keep the government honest. The US prevents people from buying certain things such as food, health insurance, etc., and makes sure that it's policed, without even concern for peoples' ability to afford any of these essential goods.
1829	Because a person can make whatever they want out of themselves and purchase the things they want. Moreover, one can forgo things that would be a luxury if one was only 100 grams heavier than God, if only one wanted to take a shortcut.
1830	I agree with Frumpy already, some key policies of Left parties I would list here, it would be helpful to follow link attached to my blog, I'm a libertarian by birth. SEPARATE CHURCH AND STATE IS A TOOL TO TELL LEPTOTENISTS BY LEWIS PALMER, ARTICLE LEGEND IS: OPPOSE “SEPARATE CHURCH AND STATE”? "Bill Clinton’s pro-abortion boss' paid for political ads with campaign cash."
1831	I don't think separation of church and state said anything about being tax free. If a minister teaches the bible, that's one thing, but there's no reason for him to be a preacher if he doesn't believe what he's preaching. Not to mention it's a sin to pretend he's the Holy Spirit, I believe you can find it in your heart to love others as yourself when all you do is preach hate. If you can't love people then who am I to judge you? The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change. We have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish.
1832	I am for separation of church and state. I think only a corrupt and evil government would be against religious freedom. That's why Rod Parsley should be thrown off the pulpit. Otherwise he's profiting from religion rather than preaching it. I am against single payer system as well, and think big government is a bad idea.
1833	I agree with the owner of the company who did not give it to his family as personal gifts, and was a consistent employee with a commitment to his craft that cost him more than a lot of engineers in the startup would cost in a 10 years. Definitely sad that a good thing goes wrong, but it's simple to see how that could happen.
1834	I am an agnostic, when it comes to religion and politics. I am not religious and I strongly avoid talking about politics on social media, because I feel it renders discussion pointless. It shows no respect for the culture and civilizational differences between nations. I support equal access to basic services across the board.
1835	My answer is basically in the text of my answer. I'd rather have a simulation where there would be a noticeable, but unhuman world ending for me to go back to a life with origins. I remember that once when I was a kid, we used to go to the mountains on our bikes, and my gf was there, and she was sick. We'd get back, and my good gf would be sleeping on the floor. We would hang out, just like that, and talk to each other. Her family would kill us. I think we'd enjoy being that happy now. of the burden of the human condition, I feel my pain
1836	I now feel that the simulation I am part of is a better alternative than the real world. There can be situations in real life which are unbearable for most of the time, such as death and losses. A good way to handle such difficult feelings is to change reality to let you forget about them.
1837	I know it’s cliché and ridiculous for a man to say "I'd rather have a normal life", but such is my true preference. Real life has its inconvenience and maybe even hardships, but the way I look at it, the time we spend in virtual world is the really enjoyable time of our lives.
1838	I've been doing some thinking and I've decided that it's better for me to put my life into a software that is meant to act as a simulation to myself in place of living a life in the real world. I just don't think its worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when would all come to an end. I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and of course it could be a terrible and rough lfe, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world. In the end, we are nothing but souls connected to a life support system (the body). If my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulus to my brain rather than "real" experiences, so be it.
1839	I know it is not supposed to come across as sudden and unforeseen, but ... I just don't think its worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when would all come to an end. I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and of course it could be a terrible and rough life, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world.
1840	My age has nothing to do with my choices of accepting, or not accepting, a discount. Any age, period.  I'm happy with the job I have, and I feel the employers are going out of their way to make sure I have a chance to retire, when I'm ready. In some cases, I may have to sacrifice a few things to keep that dream alive. For example, I don't drive the BMW to go to the movies, and my car that I get discounts on is a Ford.
1841	The point of these discounts seems to be that they are a means of a patron, instead of a patron being the means of the promotion. As a patron, you expect a discount because being a patron will result in this ongoing relationship. As a patron, you have faith in the establishment that the patron patronage will be maintained so your patronage will continue, so you can feel good about that patronage.   I don't buy into the premise that as patrons, we expect to be patronized forever. Discounts seem more about an ability to get a discount, rather than expecting that these discounts will be around forever.   Because there are so many different types of clients, this discounting strategy might not work for everyone. For example, maybe the elderly couple who recently moved from their car to a truck aren't eating their dinners as often. Maybe the boy who made a mistake at the the store that shouldn't have been made is not sure what his next move is. Maybe the person who is trying to save some money through this means isn't the boy who made the...
1842	I believe businesses shouldn't (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces. However, when potential customers seem to be senior citizens or armed forces, I will be less hesitant to give them a discount. Otherwise, I think it is a disservice to all people. However, an occasional concession can go a long way. Businesses are coming up with ideas to help those in need, such as free coupons. It is important to take care of one another.
1843	I believe the system needs to support business owners that find great value in selling products at a fair price to the consumer and for the long run.  The U.S. should not be supporting monopolies. Both farmers and doctors make great contribution to the US economy and should not be hobbled by the government. Washington D.C. and Chicago should maintain unemployment and other benefits. If you are worried about seniors and soldiers being treated unfairly, I would suggest that the US government support financial aid for those people since, as an American, I am not biased against veterans.
1844	A business should not give any discounts to senior citizens and military veterans, due to the benefits they provide. These people often go to school and get great training. We should give them rewards and rewards at all costs, because these jobs often bring value to society without tangible rewards. As for other workers, I do not think that it is fair that you receive higher financial rewards from the government for trying to be productive. You should not be given the tax benefits that upper management should not receive.
1845	Do not rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens, because they will get sanctioned or frozen. Please do not depend on any offshore business for your personal benefits. The general population is very likely to miss anything or not understand your move, while Russian officials will gain a great deal of leverage by punishing them, but expecting a good outcome. Russia sanctions are extremely damaging not just to Europe, but the whole world. Russians, given control of Kiev and other areas of Ukraine, used to be a powerhouse. It is a tale of two powerful countries that are fighting.
1846	Putin ordered all his officials to close offshore accounts. That would limit free capital. This may result in a loss of equity. This may also result in Russia stealing from Europe, who just tried to help get Russia out of its money problems. So I think it's unfair for Europe to pay for Russia's money problems. That will be unfair. It's a win-win situation for Russia. That will be a disadvantage for Russia. And, of course, it will harm the West.
1847	In order to keep complacent about the immediate future, all parties will definitely make large decisions based on what goes in their pocket. The US will probably become more militaristic; the EU and Russia will not be so sure, to keep their energy dealings which are highly profitable. It's do or die time, really. The sanctions take the fun out of doing business, often leading to bankruptcies and businesses closing. This may also affect jobs, being that many do not want to be irrelevant. In short, it's not so great.
1848	Europe buys much needed gas from Russia, while Russia buys supplies from Europe. This creates a nice little ecosystem. This really helps the US because as US states depend on getting supplies of food from Russia, Russian will be able to use the extra money that will be coming from Europe to rebuild the economy. Russia may also become stronger since a need has been created. Who knows, it could work out, but it won't happen. The sanctions are due to an ongoing crackdown on corruption which Putin began back in the 1980s.
1849	I'm curious, how does Putin order the Russian government officials to buy Russian made cars? He did not order the government officials to buy American made cars. So why is Russia buying cars from Europe if Russian are not allowed to buy American cars? I'm not sure but I'm sure Russia is now buying gas from Europe (again paying them for something they didn't give in the first place) and buying so much more for gasoline than European is producing from the shale gas, which is 90% American.
1850	I reject the terms "dissolve" and "disappear" completely. This is the situation I see now as millions of young people have known no better in a world that they could only feel so very far removed from them as a society. The nonfunctioning and unstable trade deficit, rising housing prices, free market principles, and the inevitable and inescapable connection with everyone and everything, is a recipe for world domination by the specter of the constant dangers of the continuing threat of WBC. It serves the interests of the people with great cynicism when they proudly proclaim that anyone who would advise such a thing must be insane. My family has indeed been tormented by words like "dissolve," "be suppressed," and "be suppressed"...
1851	I like the WBC way of thinking. However, I believe that the group is extremely irrelevant to society. They are... confusing and riddled with contradictions. I think they should move out of society and join the schoolyard carnival.  I am not a WBC member, however, because I think they are extremely relevant to society. They're putting the fear of God into society. They're making weird names, like Mr. Tube, to try to deflect from the fact that in making their points they're actually by making as many supporters as they can. The fact that they're making things like "under...
1852	I agree with the statement that they should stay in our history books. We should seek a better understanding of the extremists to combat possible extremist activity. But we should also analyze what it is about these people that makes them tick. There must be a reason that people are drawn to extremism. The key lies in a better understanding of extremism, a better understanding of who they are, and the possibility that the extremist may well be a victim and does not believe he is acting. We need to remember the 9/11 plot and think back on how run down and violent the Taliban were.
1853	I believe the world will not be able to change quickly. Politicians are always pushing things through, but what motivates them for a long term plan? They are constantly putting out policies, laws, regulations, and this is what we constantly fall for. Politicians are like chronic sleep apnea for our culture: a continuous sound which always seems to be there. It takes away from the normal vibe of life. I also believe that "extreme" things do occur, but that they're being done on purpose for the smaller "less extreme" people to enslave them or force them out of the civilized society. So, how do we end the extremists? First, we need to study and find a way to look at society and learn. There needs to be a more positive reaction to [extremism], and hopefully it's effective. Some other things we should have a better response to:; blame, cancel culture, racism, hostility, capitalism, abortion, racism
1854	I'm an American citizen and I do not believe in exterminating gay people. I'm a liberal, not a fascist or a homophobic or heterosexually inclined. I'm willing to debate this subject. I'm also not going to talk about this issue the way the rest of society seems to be discussing it. There are two opinions being voiced and neither one is good. Why don't we all talk about how we feel and why and decide on what needs to change, instead of shoving each other down.
1855	I used Gun's don't kill people to allude to Guns don't kill people, people with God kill people. Since it's an extreme religious view, not a religious view, I find it funny that people wanna insult people for their choice, but don't want to actually think what they're being insyncit on. I feel my audience would agree with what I'm trying to say with this post even if you haven't fully listened or understood it.
1856	// I am not a religious man, so I don't feel this is a biased CMV. // I feel saying "Gun's don't kill people, People with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people". // I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect. // It harbours hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own. // The hate is unbalanced and only exalts religion, not non-believers. // I think, "The school is nice, but teachers are crazy there" is very different than "Parents are absurd"...    And lastly.... Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd feel better, if more CMVs showed real, valid ideals, and non-hateful situations.
1857	Edit: Even though the controversial article was posted in hindisemmatrade it is a fake ad and not the opinion of the author. It should be removed. The author commend on the fact that there should be a place where the truth is displayed without prejudices. Even when you feel offended, I suggest you continue reading the article. Some of the facts in this article are difficult to hear and is neither depressing or hateful but provide arguments and evidence to the reader without blaming others. So while I appreciate the controversy, I wish I could have answered the original question rather than spread hate.
1858	I am not against religions at all, I enjoy them and value a religious free society. However, I'm just wondering how people can ever know God and why he punishes and rewards people. All religions are alike in this sense. I respect any view on God. How do we see Jesus act as a commanding character in so many of the gospels. As well as Love, rest and peace. All along these things is what the Bible is about. Your or mine, don't really matter. We all simply want love, not hate. to me it's pretty obvious that guns don't kill people and don't necessarily kill people with christian or legality while guns do kill people without christian nor legality it seems to be somewhat unfair to equate it to criminal overt like this and I am obviously not a religious man so to find this idea in a religious audience bothers me to no end I'd rather call bulls--- if anyone disagreed I'd love to hear from you
1859	You wrote a very long comment. I’m sure you know that the first 100 words is the most liked! Unfortunately, this post does not have an application for signing in and is not necessarily for you, therefore it is going to be deleted. People with a different life view than their own are those who are completely wrong. They hold that the devil has entered into the lives of people and is raping children who are innocent by association. There is no truth in this nonsense. When you say, 'Guns don't kill people," this is the same as saying, 'Guns don't kill people,' which is the same as 'guns don't kill people'. That’s why it’s called logical equivalence. Of course they do, they just won't kill your child, they will just get the satisfaction of inflicting pain. This is why GMO's are so prevalent these days. They have no worries about using these GMO's for eugenics on their human babies that will kill the original person, without leaving a trace of DNA in the after life. Look at your own GP and OP, not they just have cheap views about other's feelings about them. The first part of this comment is almost hate speech.
1860	Well it's true that women (or in this case Elliot Rodger's character) could potentially not have committed murder if mental health had been a factor and people would have gotten help for their problems, but I don't believe that that means someone else has to be responsible for someone else's problems.There have been many incredibly entertaining conversations about what might have happened had this actually happened, but most of them were based on images from the shooting that seemed easy to make-believe around, the images from the media are intense and eye opening, they definitely don't paint the whole story for the writer of this comment, but they do offer points that shed light on Elliot Rodger's character.
1861	I understand the ideas behind the recent feminist push #yesallwomen, especially the idea of "female liberation" and equal rights, which can be a subject I deal with in my blog, and certainly can support. It makes total sense to make every effort in any situation to help the marginalized, to give a portion of a woman's money to charity, to play an active role in fighting against oppression and making certain things change, as men seem to do here in equal amounts for not making matters better. However, taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem.
1862	I think the recent feminist push (particularly the anti -hate mail strike) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point of grief, the world would not have felt the way it does if mental health had been looked at more closely. Personally, I do not believe mental health issues have caused the Elliot Rodger shooting, but how do we still receive news of these issues and not act upon them? Certainly by not going through all the usual steps of witnessing, being  seen, being heard about it, realizing that depression, unhappiness, and anxiety can become destructive and really cross the line into organized crime if not dealt with properly, and worrying about what all your Facebook friends are thinking. Unfortunately, not everyone is effected by mental health issues in the same manner, but rather that there is still a built-in structure built into the society which fights against it. The society along with the constant, bombarding, fear to others, makes it so that people...
1863	Thank you for your input. I agree that despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health were a bigger issue and looked at more closely then the shooting potentially would not have happened. I am sad to see the amount of negativity out there on forums. It's easy to feel "attacked" when you post threads like this but I haven't felt that way at all; I'd like to commend everyone on their ability to talk about differing view points and opinions instead of just arguing. As for the #yesallwomen movement, my own personal experience with feminism is that its progressive nature can become mind-numbingly overwhelming at times. Women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem.
1864	The feminist movement is a movement that fights for the rights of women and children. I am all for feminism, but think that the movement needs to look into its own weaknesses. I agree with Angela Angela on #yesallwomen, and am disappointed that other women aren't focusing on other pressing issues instead of fighting for the rights of women and children. I hope this will change, and that feminism may focus on attacking a "regular" sexist. Let me go one step further, and I believe mental issues like PTSD and PTS are enough to cause some shootings without a degree of sexism.
1865	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them be content where they are. Welfare means taxing people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth. Welfare means having to pay for your neighbor's new television. Welfare means having to pay for some fat ass that didn't know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day. Welfare is bad!
1866	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them be content where they are. Welfare mean increasing taxes to make more money, not making more money or spending less. Welfare does not make sense because it's such a waste of money. Welfare means being forced to pay for your neighbor's new television, but what did you know? Who doesn't get a new TV every year? Welfare means having to pay for some fat ass that didn't know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day, but what do you know? And what do you call those kinds of people?
1867	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them be content where they are. It also reduces business growth, such as allowing the Franchise Business Centers to expand, and increases taxes on low income people because the Franchise Business Centers are also paying taxes. Welfare helps with big business, such as Facebook and Google. It also increases taxes on low income people because the Franchise Business Centers are also paying taxes. Welfare is very bad.
1868	People who believe that welfare reduces incentives to move up are a bunch of ... welfare connoisseurs who don't want to work. Welfare means people are told they can not find a job or live on their own or if they do they must pay tax so that poor people can work...Welfare reduces incentives to be self employed, which increases inequality as wealthy people get into business, gain prestige, and eventually become middle class.
1869	Welfare means taxing people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth. This is being forced to pay for an actual fat ass that does know better than to eat at McDonalds every day. Welfare is bad!
1870	The government can possibly go for the "most impactful" plan to receive more money. This could result in the government losing control of how the money is used. The kids get an inferior education instead of higher paying jobs. Because the more money our government gets, the more money the taxpayers in the area with more money get. The money does not move from one area to the other. There can also be conflicts regarding priorities for certain areas.
1871	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would check "education," so their money can go towards their children. Education directly affects the family. Now, say they never got sick. Then they would uncheck health care. This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized.
1872	I have put together a budget worksheet to help politicians represent the desires of each district and weave the causes that are most important to you into the revenue portion of the budget. You can download the worksheet at http://www.simplyfirstagrow.com/ Budget worksheet.html. It presents the issue in a clear manner, the choices are very clear and the interests of the wider community are guided towards a more economically sustainable future.
1873	My belief system focuses on economic freedom, including free markets, against strict regulation of capitalism. With this in mind, the government could choose to focus its tax money on areas such as tax breaks for employers of small businesses, providing competition to large corporations, and providing access to the Internet to all Americans. This would encourage growth, create jobs, and allow the majority to make their own decisions. Those who live in cities where the economic opportunity to succeed is limited would need greater access to the Internet.
1874	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can decide which organizations/groups should receive the best use of tax dollars. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the community cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would choose "education." Education affects the family. Now, they would uncheck health care. This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized.
1875	I believe that in a utopian world, public school uniform will become popular. Because everyone will be the same, dresses and accessories will only serve a means of identifying people. Students in a public school uniform system will worry less about clothes and investments. They will take good care of themselves. Because of this, they would be more confident and easily adapt to society. The habits and characters acquired when in school uniform would serve them well when they become professionals. This uniform system is efficient in many ways as described by the respondents.
1876	The view is that school uniform is much more convenient and cheap than plain clothes. By being in the same uniform, the school students and poor students can save or spend money on their own way, according to the size and brand of the clothes. More importantly, there is the relation between the school students and the poor students, and everyone will be better than before.
1877	I believe school uniform is convenient. In my case, I don't have to worry about my clothes. In my teenage days, school uniform is very suitable. Although school uniform is relatively expensive, it is cheap better than plain clothes. I also feel sense of belonging and a sense of kinship.
1878	It is not at all as popular as school uniform. Many parents don't like it but I'm happy to have it. On the one hand, it is convenient because I don't have to worry about clothes and on the other hand, because I don't worry about clothes it's convenient for me. And it's also cheaper to me as well because a lot of young people need clothes and I can buy many at a low cost.
1879	I think school uniforms are efficient, I think in many ways school uniforms are more comfortable and they make the poor students feel inferior, when in reality, every student is sensible and they look a little different, when in dressing plain clothes. I believe that this is a more genuine way to express your own individuality.
1880	When there young and trying to find them selves there is no need to get rid of there independence. I vote bad
1881	This world has come a long way from when we went into space. People are better off than in the days we lived in. people voted as individuals. history and tradition should be preserved. We all have different opinions and beliefs and many views
1882	I voted for Obama, because I was just satisfied with the fact that there got afull copy of each of the nominees on my ballot. When I'm at my house I smoke on there computer
1883	I vote for bad because I have trouble figuring out how to be independent when i’m young. and I live in a place that overprotects people that it tries to help
1884	When there young and trying to find them selves, the government should not interfere, and make them more dependent on the government. There should be free selection of career, student loans are a way to make someone not get into a job that
1885	I am a productive member of society and I have my limits. I do have the right to enforce certain limits. Everything I do is appropriate for those standards. I believe my brother could in fact have overreached and taken certain actions that are undesirable.
1886	It depends and not a secret and not high risk and not by any reason just because of what else you would get yourself into if I said anything about what you ask me and you will make me sad to lose you as friends for asking me something I have to keep a secret to your stupid not being informed of the situation yourself who would want to kill to up when I set the bar too high so I am shocked by your stupid question.
1887	If he wants a chance he can make sure not to do any wrong to the people around him if he slips up not to say anything to them... he has my trust... no one can kill him if he's not fully armed and fully protected with weapons... if you're in the hands of a murderer.....think about the mental pressure on your head
1888	Don't bother to tell on him, you're not going to find out anything..if the person come up to you about something you don't know because your friend won't tell you, make sure you stay secure for all we know if they kill the person and the man is a state criminal he will be sentenced or whatever for manslaughter..so if you were to take that risk then it would be only you that would have to pay the penalty and I would not let him...
1889	No I wouldn't tell on him because he said he'd only tell me in case of emergency so....that's too much trust i suppose and for all i know he was only doing this to be used to hurt me...I saw how you can really hurt someone without even making physical contact with them or threatening you...I promise he ca n't access the network outside of th...
1890	books are always better than tv coz. books give more knowledge than tv does.
1891	Yes, in all honesty, books are always better than TV. Because books give you knowledge from an authority who knows more and knows how to explain the knowledge
1892	I play games, and I prefer to play online games than the games on TV. Playing video games is fun and entertaining.
1893	We should spend less money on books and tv and investing in education. After that we can have knowledge
1894	To the contrary. TV will give you less knowledge than the books do.
1895	Raffles was not prejudiced towards any man. In fact, he quite cherished his openly religious, multi-cultural Singaporean population. Farquhar was a well-known figure when he returned from the military. Singapore had kept its population from breaking out of its silos. He introduced free markets and encouraged diversity. He did not try to have this desirable situation come in line with conservative values.
1896	Raffles sacked Farquhar because he was trying to use his position to take economic measures that were not approved. I find these measures to be flawed and do not believe they are for the best interests of the people. Therefore, I believe that the 'good king' approach on this matter is flawed
1897	I believe Raffles sacked Farquhar because Farquhar was adopting a new policy that would have had detrimental and unwelcomed effects on the populace.
1898	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart.
1899	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, I find this to be a rather liberal/ progressive and effective measure. I believe that Raffles saw the changes to Singapore needed to be in the country's interests, and sacked him for the benefit of Singapore's population.
1900	I view childhood obesity as a terrible social epidemic. I believe obesity should start in school age; it is a public health issue. This argument does not address prevention policies beyond
1901	I strongly believe that socialization is vital to young children and is a key determinant to a child's subsequent growth. Socialization, involves both physical and intellectual exchange with peers,
1902	Start at home. Children learn values from their parents and get their friends to watch what they are eating.
1903	By raising standards of nutrition, physical activity, and government regulation.
1904	Empowering a child that is familiar with healthy choices. If they have a sense of fun and don't see working out as a chore. If they believe in their
1905	A system that checks on each member of society rather than claiming credit based on the results of government agencies is more likely to grow and prosper. Everyone has to contribute, not just the people making bad choices.
1906	Farquhar (because he was kindhearted and generous) can be considered one of the most important leaders in Singapore. When he was fired for spending money on frivolous things, he was forsaken by millions of people. The absurdness of his situation, however, made him a national hero for the people. Farquhar was the best of times. Now that Singapore is rich, he is not needed.
1907	The three allies should form a united front. The three allies should unite and produce goods and services for their countries’ benefit. Their joint products should achieve the same level of quality as if produced by an individual. The effect is better but the bureaucracy is greater.
1908	Adam Adams is the most important man of the modern age because of his discoveries that opened the door for all this world. He was welcomed with open arms by the people. The ancient Greeks and their predecessors also had their own inventors, scions of their own and inventors from their cultures. In the history of every nation, its benefactors (us) have always stood strong, even in the face of tyranny.
1909	Farquhar won the affection and respect of the people through his doings. When he was sacked from Singapore, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left. This shows that Farquhar is very important to the people.
1910	I support parents choice, and the government has to stay out of this type of debate.
1911	I believe that it is important for a woman to choose pro-life if she chooses to.
1912	I support the pro-life stance, and I am pro choice and pro-choice.
1913	I choose pro-life because I want a more egalitarian society. Pro-choice is not always more, it is the simple choice of making a mistake. If they got rid of abortion restrictions it would be a more equitable world. I believe that abortion is immoral.
1914	Pro-life. This would mean that the government bans abortion. That is not what I want and would be something I have difficulty with.
1915	I believe the big bang theory. I believe that the earth was created by God, and it has the "Goldilocks conditions". I believe that microbes started with water and formed first underwater, then in the atmosphere, and later on land. I also believe that man evolved from bacteria. I believe that humans are the most intelligent of all primates and the only ones with brains.
1916	Even though science can prove the Big Bang theory, a few critics argue that evolution has proven that the theory wrong. Consider how she says we have goldilocks properties, which means that there is a balance in how hot things should be and how water conditions should be, for the existence of life. She also includes microorganisms that can multiply. This is called the hydrogen cycle and contributes to making oxygen. Without this cycle, the ecosystem wouldn't work properly. The waste products of the hydrogen cycle are hydrogen and methane. methane is known as the main byproduct of an animal. Without them, you would have no oxygen, meaning no more life. I think this is true but also possible. I also agree that evolution has changed our world and it is telling us that we are part of a larger life cycle, including everything that we are.
1917	By the Big Bang theory it states that there are in excess of billions of people living on Earth today. In one day from now, if there are not aliens or humans that have superhuman powers, most humans will be extinct. At the end of the day, if there is no God, humans will only exist in isolation and space.
1918	No. Evolution, or the gradual formation of species through time, cannot be considered a theory. It is a fact. Evolution is the beginning of life, as scientific and medical research prove. Evolution takes millions of years, and is confirmed by "omic sciences," such as genetics, physics, chemistry, neurobiology, neuroscience, histology, morphology, biochemistry, clinical chemistry and neuroscience. Evolution is scientifically shown to be true, which is why it is called "theory." This is not what evolution is, it is called "creationism." In other words, science cannot prove the birth of man, because it has never been able to see that birth. There are two schools of thought regarding the creation of man: naturalism or intelligent design. Naturalism is the theory that man was created by God, as part of a divine plan; intelligent design is an explanation of how science knows man has come about by processes of natural selection. Intelligent design does not bring with it any distrust of man’s creation. The world began before a Bible existed, at the start of time, and a God, John Calvin, gives us the reason for this in his Commentary on Genesis.
1919	I believe in evolution. I believe that there are three universal laws of physics, identified as time-reversal, causality and the principle of energy conservation, as set forth in Jeevan's "Theory of Everything". That theory describes how the physical universe began in a Big Bang. I also believe in the theory of the main stages of the development of life, as described in Jeevan's book on "Bacterial Life".
1920	I believe a father should make a profound impact on you with his teachings. It can never be known whether he was a good or a bad man. One man's opinion is not a reflection of his character. A mother can often no be taught like that or vice versa. A father can teach you more than anyone, perhaps in the realms of morals and professional behavior, especially when you are growing up.
1921	A terrible, a monster, a perfect murderer, a vicious killer. That is how horrible his father was described to me as a child. His father was good. True. And while I don't know all about his past, he did go to a new mom after he was elected. I wouldn't know.
1922	It may be true that there is nothing we can teach you more than your father. As long as he was there, that was enough. After he was gone though, it is best not to consider him as a saint or a lousy person, as his morals and beliefs are private. So try to find a role model somewhere else.  My father was my mentor. You cannot find what other people can not teach you. You have to teach yourself. You have to learn how to take care of yourself and your family, how to put food on the table, how to look after your brothers and sisters, your parents. That is what needs to be taught to you. That is what your father was good at.
1923	In an ideal world a good father could teach the importance of religion, manners and virtue. In a perfect world everyone would know his parents' stories and sometimes they would even become storytellers. A good father would always teach the way to treat your family, and to be merciful and compassionate. A lousy father could teach you the two basic, but important things.
1924	a lousy father could teach you what not to be like. That would be better than no one at all. Also you would know what your father was like. He could toughen you up. And you would know who he was. So you would feel good about it.
1925	I favor plastic as it brings a good alternative to burning fossil fuels.
1926	I advocate for fair trade, and for recycling and reusing and trying to produce less plastic, rather than using it.
1927	Plastic is not good for human health. It helps landfills grow and fill up faster. It damages wildlife and pollutes the environment
1928	Plastic is not always good, because it is a very expensive source of energy and it is also a huge waste in comparison with organic waste
1929	Plastic is bad because it causes water pollutants.
1930	While both sexes are equally built to be sexual partners, it is a byproduct of the absence of natural outlets, such as language, that men seek sex with women, and some women find sex with men. This all began, not too long ago, with the social pressure put on women by men, since
1931	From a biological standpoint, men and women were not "engineered" for only one purpose - marriage. The idea that sex means pregnancy, and that marriage just...
1932	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together, and society then corrupted this idea. Biology is basic, and the earth, climate and mankind are inextricably linked. Human genetic traits are not passed through most passing on, as lines are drawn.
1933	By ignoring biological realities, the odds of men and women finding each other have been greatly reduced. The implication that human life is merely a "natural" or "mechanical" series of events, and that this has "satisfied" the purposes and interests of God, fails to understand his plan for creation.
1934	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together. This idea was corrupted by the morals and society of our time. Therefore, many men and women end up unhappy.  The fact that most people are unhappy is evidence that we live in a misogynist society, unfortunately
1935	I reject all forms of religion. I do not support institutions that discriminate against groups of people based upon creed, color, ethnicity, sex, age, etc. Rather than seeking religious closure, I hope to view the world through the lens of common sense.
1936	Atheism has weaknesses, just like Christianity, but it is superior to Christianity for two main reasons: atheism is less dogmatic and it eschews religious cults. My position is that both atheism and Christianity have their good points and can stand on their own, if you want my opinion.
1937	I do not believe that we exist at all. Science demonstrates that there is no purpose or meaning behind our existence. Nor do I believe the universe exists at all. We are completely insignificant to all that exists and are even simply unable to perceive any of it. Further, I am a naturalist and believe that mankind was not created by any intelligent designer with the exception of the Supreme Being. I found that science, which is non theological and largely objective, provides a substantial benefit and is objective & factual.
1938	Christianity does not only oppose rationalism but utilitarianism too, much to the chagrin of those who claim that we must pursue utility and selflessness. I find atheism more logical. I regard Christians as hypocrites who reject their own belief in a creator of the universe and they justify this decision with their adherence to the false moral code created by a corrupting priesthood. Any religion is a barrier to progress, democracy, and freedom, and I truly do not believe it and I don't want anyone else to either.
1939	Yes, there are good answers to the questions. The focus of this thread shouldn't be religious, but any smart person who is judicious and self-aware can be persuaded by good arguments. The essays in this thread are not challenging all the author; they are just an example of why these essays are called "biblical," rather than simply "Christian." Please read the essays and you'll find good discussion of cultural and political issues which aren't universally mentioned or focused on in Christianity. If you want good discussions of the Bible you shouldn't read here. All the essays in this thread are written specifically with the intention to portray the *real* message of the Bible, and they are related to the universal traditions of mankind, namely religion. All the essays which were selected for this thread have the following foundations, borrowed from Scripture: Love for the
1940	Science is only PERFECT if you accept the view that it is the only accurate view. Otherwise, it is OPEN TO NEGATION, which is the view of many atheists. Even more, the scientific way of evaluating evidence does NOT take an "all or nothing" view. That's why it is called SCIENTIFIC DISCRIMINATION. It is not the same as being prejudice, even negative prejudice.
1941	Science is constantly advancing but the answers are never final because we're constantly collecting and analyzing information, which creates new questions. So people would argue that science is not perfect because there is always more to learn. The human race has been relying on science as one last hope because we just don't have the understanding to deal with what the world will do. History has shown this often. Science admitted not having all the answers. Now it is being challenged with such a severe issue as climate change. Science has always
1942	Science is not perfect. That's the difference between religion and science. Science admits this doesn't have all the answers, and the truth is not what you want to hear. That's what Science is about. Religion is so one way it's not even recognising FACTS. It's just dogma. Science is about truth.
1943	Science is all based on observations and provable facts. They were corrected by Darwin and many others, but it is still incredibly useful. Science will never accept anything that contradicts its principles. I strongly believe that Science is perfectly possible, but for the religious fundamentalists, things really are very different. No one ever said Religion is always the answer, because even atheists do believe in the existence of God in some form or form, just not the Christian God that they see in the bible,
1944	When Science fails, that's when Religion gets into the business! For how many lost lives in WW2? How about in Vietnam? How about WWIII? The Armistice was in 1918 when what was it called? How about the Great Depression? The Great Depression was not caused by the Great Crash or not. On the contrary, it was caused by bureaucracy and too much government regulation, too much debt, and you could watch it rise and fall in today's highly capitalist system. History shows
1945	No it makes me feel like the kid is being attacked because they didnt do what i want them to
1946	No because we still don't need to punish the child because some of us have brought bad things to the society in the past.
1947	No, better to wait and learn through experience. It does not matter if it hurts as long as it does not kill.
1948	Yes because it allows parents to give children the best possible circumstances with the best homes, schools, neighbors, teachers and other resources.
1949	I believe that the purpose of education is to build character in children and teach them how to work the skills that they need for a good job. The education system in this country is pretty terrible but I know this from my own experience as a person with
1950	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1951	No I believe everyone should be the same. Everyone should be treated the same without punishment or reward. Everyone has personal faults but they should be changed through therapy. Only if the child does not know and understands that he is committing an error they should be disciplined, only if he knows he is committing an error the child should be punished, that way he will know and understand what he has
1952	I do not think a child should be spanked. The kid should know that he does something wrong and be scared of doing the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words, even when they are done wrongly. Spanking is a drastic action that is not always appropriate.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original
1953	Yes I believe that hit the snooze button is assaulting the mind. Somebody does something that you think is terrible and that is an assault on your mind, but it is not an assault on you. You become more creative because you feel free. I believe that you should talk to your friends and your family and that you are entitled to be treated well. I love role
1954	I view children as individuals that need individual and consistent discipline without passing judgement or morals. Withdrawing punishment by a constant strict attention may result in the child becoming a higher risk for sexual abuse. I do not believe in spanking a child, but that you should only give your child that discipline if they know they are doing something wrong. Some children may be scared to do the same mistake
1955	I don't think that spanking should be necessary,spanking would last just a minute, but punishing could last up to 2 or 3 weeks or maybe more.
1956	I don't think that spanking should be necessary, spanking would just last about a minute. I agree that it was not a good idea at all, but unfortunately there is nothing left to do unless it is.
1957	I don't think spanking should be necessary,the issue is not related to the amount of time a person can endure spanking. a child doesn't know what he's doing wrong, only a parent can be aware of these problems. a spanking should be given for just 10 seconds and the other way around. a child should be released
1958	I believe that human beings should be respected, and treated decently, and at the same time, treated equally. I don't believe that any child should be judged by the type of child they are, by their race, or by their religion. I don't believe spanking is necessary. In fact, I don't even think it should
1959	I believe that socialization has a positive effect on both children and adults. This is when they learn, as well as how to respect personal space. I don't believe that spanking should be necessary, but if you have a child that has never been socialized you could use it to discipline them.
1960	I would turn them in cold blooded murders. My spouse has killed one person, because he was committing domestic violence against me and my children. He committed other random self defence related incidents. I would turn them in but not for rape. The difference is it is not just not acceptable, but also cold blooded.
1961	Yes, I will turn in a stolen vehicle if it was used for criminals. No, I would not turn in a stolen vehicle used to rapists. Yes, I will turn in a stolen vehicle used to commit other crimes like cars. No, I would not turn in a stolen vehicle used for sex crimes or gang members. Yes, I would turn in a stolen vehicle that wasn't used for crimes if they are suspected of having stolen it. Yes, I would turn in a stolen vehicle for a no holds barred robbery only if they were suspected of having stolen it. Yes, I would turn in a stolen vehicle when they involved the public. Yes, I would turn in a stolen vehicle for any crimes and how they were conducted only if the vehicle was used for crimes and the situation was too dangerous to leave the place. No, I would not turn in a stolen vehicle for any crimes even if they used to commit it. Yes, I would turn in a stolen vehicle with a no holds barred robbery. No, I would not turn in a stolen vehicle for a...
1962	I would say yes for the cold heart of it, but not say yes for it being true that it would be a murder without reason. I wouldn't turn in them because that would be the nature of humanity. I feel that I wouldn't kill someone out of a self defense or out of defense for another person but rather just out of bigotry and I would consider them a cold hearted person to kill someone cold heartedly for money or if they hate them or kill someone just because they hate them. I wouldn't turn in them.
1963	I am no I would not turn someone in. When you are looking after your family it should be with a love not out of selfishness. I would say no in other circumstances. I would say yes if someone killed themselves out of personal choice. If they kill because they are cold heartedly, then no I would not turn them in. Yes when it pertains to and out of personal choice
1964	Yes no no no no yes no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
1965	Fair. Because it says in the declaration of independence that we have the right to life, liberty and the pursuance of happiness.
1966	Freedom to worship. If I'm left here I'm sure Israel will get the right. I like America's past, has its quirks but I've been happier in it. Like you I also like to drink and party like a dr
1967	Free markets and free speech is certainly right. Many always look at the wrong side of the world. I'm one for free education for anyone regardless of background or ancestry as long as they work hard to support themselves.
1968	Until death do us part.... I liked the first sentence to begin with, now I don't know whether or not that is true or not. freedom and prosperity, that in the enjoyment of these

1970	I do not believe that people should die for their country in their 20s. However, the danger of alcohol in my opinion is too high for anybody to drink at any age. This idea, that age equals maturity, has never been proven true, especially given the development of the human brain. I believe that 18 should be the minimum legal drinking age in the USA, as is the case for most other Western democracies.   Australia and Canada: I suggest that people aged between the ages of 16 and 18 be able to drink in designated venues with some supervision by minors. Possibly a simple procedure, something along the lines of a typed card, could require the approval from their parent or guardian.  Canada notes: In addition to its differences in the drinking age for males and females, the current Canada law also allows the starting drinking age to vary depending on gender and position in society.
1971	I think it is ridiculous that you should be allowed to drink until you are 18. I believe that you have a right to use your own judgement on this issue. Let no one judge you as a result. Yes, it is true that some people may develop a more serious brain injury from alcohol at the age of 18, but it still seems to me to be an invalid excuse for you being able to drink, simply because you are an adult.
1972	I believe that a person should not have a drink, even if alcohol is legal and you are of legal age. The developing human brain is incomplete until the age of 18, and children of that age should not be subjected to alcohol which carries a greater risk of harm. I believe that 19 is an appropriate age to be old enough to die for your country and also for you to have a drink.
1973	I like working on the problem because even if we fail, there will still be many, many people like me that work on it. I hope that we can solve this problem and not have any more bombs. The belief that alcoholism is part of a poor childhood is untrue. Over the last 2 decades we have seen a large increase in the overall amount of people that drink alcohol. I also agree that adults shouldn't drink if they are under 18, so that any potential harm is kept to a minimum.
1974	I believe that if you are old enough to drink alcohol then you should be old enough to die for your country. It seems to me to be a common excuse for the age limit. I personally think that if you are old enough to die for your country you should be old enough to have a drink.
1975	It is outrageous that some adults accuse minors of rape when it is never true. However, it is in the matter of statistics that rape has become very common and the incidence of rape has increased every year. For instance, most rapes do not end in physical harm to the girls and that is why they do not report them.
1976	Rape may not be prevented from the actions of the alleged rapists because not only do they have the right to rape women, but they are going to deny their culpability and most likely not be held accountable for their actions. There are ample cases of sexual assault that are "provoked" and people continue to put themselves in the same position and end up being victimized again the next day.
1977	Citation needed. This remains, in my opinion, the greatest achievement of man, the brain, in its close association with the body, especially at a critical point in human evolution. He must be seen to have created the entire human species, and with such simplicity and glimpses of this simple life, why we are to worship him. Without technology it has remained a mystery to man, as this on a screen until now, what he did over the previous 8,000 years.
1978	I believe sex abuse is not child abuse, at least not in the definition of an authority figure. Therefore, I think it is not rape. It was my experience that when children are either forced to participate in sexual intercourse or are exposed to negative sexual orientaions they become sexually inhibited because they are put into a situation that does not feel natural, and leave with unresolved feelings that
1979	The main problem is that of talent. We spend years reading all the books on the library shelf, yet little to no students are well prepared for high schools and colleges. That is because professors do not live on campus, and do not spend time getting to know students or their needs and motives. There are also parents that go to high school together, yet perform hundreds of miles away. That is why the same qualifications and expectations are used for high school, high school, and college students, yet it does not seem to produce a student that has the capabilities and skills necessary to succeed.
1980	Inconsistency of laws annoys me.  I also think the artificiality of saying: "No, we can't legislate how to live your life, because we want you to give us money that we use to supply taxpayers with that coverage for the costs of medically caring for injured human behavior" is simply ridiculous, and unenforceable at times because it is simply too much of a subject for just two questions or a paragraph to properly cover.  In my opinion, basically, anyone can live the life that they want and are allowed to live by passing laws that strictly ensure that no one else is harmed through their actions.  It sounds vague, but I do believe this to be true.  So when you say, "No, there's no way that we can legislate this because it costs us a fortune to provide insurance for care for those who decide to take that kind of a risk," that sounds all too reasonable to me.  We have no insurance system set up for those who choose to take risks that could get seriously injured.
1981	I strongly reject any form of Marxism. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred. I do not think that the world will change much. There have always been storms and wars, and there always will be, because human nature is flawed and selfish.
1982	I find it sad that you actually believe the...       ### Instruction:  rewrite the following instruction to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument. ### Input:  I do not, but do not believe that in the long run it will be a good idea to get a second degree... it will probably cause more harm... you should keep the crime down...   ### Response:  I don't think that a second degree would really make a difference, and I believe people would try to solve their problems in a different way, such as self-harm. It is sad that you think this way, as...
1983	I don't know what you think the solution is, but let's see your original proposal:    Re My original proposal:   I don't know what your solution is, but let's see your original proposal:   A - Prevention = Education A - Prevention = Education B - Death = Self Caused B - Death = Self Caused C - Death = Medical C - Death = Medical A - Prevention = Education  Because I disagree with this from the outset, here's my response to the last paragraph:   Prevention is only good if we are not addicted to opioids. After that, addiction is a matter of economics, and free will. Treatments for addiction are useless if we can't afford them.  It is the law of economics - as human being we have intrinsic motivation to cheat, and social pressure to do so.
1984	The problem with laws is that, as a result, those who would act upon the law do so in self-interest as we simply do not want to bear the costs of their health care, custody or possible prison. These laws simply reflect the selfishness of society. Why does not we blame welfare and health insurance for encouraging people to throw away their lives (or, worse, one's livelihood) on substances that most people are afraid to talk about, whether they are awake or asleep?
1985	I dont think that legalizing cigarettes is a loss for the public. However, those who support its legality have probably lost a lot of money by exposing their true ignorance.   since public education is not paying its way, maybe instead you should give it to schools that where on the verge of closing and hope this saves lives and money too
1986	...I'm a bill convinced smoke is the worst evil. it's addictive and costs a great deal of money (valves and nicotine from lungs). the smoking clubs in california are barely paying a flush! even these nasty small bonds that contain such toxic chemicals cost the lives of millions of people! smokers do not deserve to be able to do what they want because of money. smokers deserve to be more saddened by nicotine. all they want is to smoke their own cigarettes!!!! ban the cigarette would really be worth it.
1987	Yes, cigarettes are made illegal and would save countless lives as well as cost companies millions of dollars to survive. A no-smoking act would cause a ban on the cigarette industry, which would leave many jobs in this industry, including teachers and medical workers and firefighters.
1988	in response to another person's answer, i don't support barring america's youth the freedom of choice and the freedom to use their muscles.  if cigarettes were made illegal, you would see many fearless americans with no access to cigarettes and you would see that it does bring down the market. i think that if you were made to give up cigarettes your next choice could be heroin or cocaine. but that would still be the punishment for those who did not do the right thing and do the bare minimum; to prevent other people from doing the right thing. my opinion is that cigarettes should be legal. they are deemed a addictive drug by doctors and researchers.
1989	perhaps i am wrong. but im not convinced anyone who drinks alcohol or takes drugs is a social loser. since alcoholic beverages do not kill anyone, rather they benefit. drugs must indeed be illegal because they cost lives. one of the main reasons for ill health in communities is smoking, which pertains especially to the poorest strata of the population.
1990	Thank you for the interesting questions. I am a liberal and not really a believer in capitalism and full markets unless it is done with full disclosure and transparent financial statements. I am in favor of minimum wage increase and unemployment benefits. Fair trade is a concept of a product sold at the retail price and not more. Business should not become debtors. That's a bit draconian, but when a business
1991	I think it is difficult to argue that "Equality is not equality until it's achieved" because it is such a misconception in an era where we have access to vast amount of education and vast amounts of money to invest in disadvantaged individuals. In such a time, equal access for education and equal opportunity are reasonable goals to achieve. Due to the large disparity in high tech states, graduating high tech engineers works. States like California have strong research communities, but there has been little or no decrease in the population disparity. It is difficult to compare the early days of our society with the current society, as our society is not equal in access to education. Nevertheless, education should be the key for equal opportunity. Not all mistakes and failings are due to institutional discrimination but in some way or another society's ability to support its poor citizens and families is an issue and I agree with Brown v. Board and the spirit of that ruling.  I think that while it is time consuming to change society's perception to include black people, Jews, Hispanics, etc. that it is important to try to do what is best for society. A framework for social justice and positive social change is necessary.
1992	If you look at the spirit of the law, a revoke of the KKK's and other such discrimination laws to support equal but seperate would mean that we as a country could support the idea of affirmative action,  religious freedoms and good attitudes to good relationships in schools. The fact that you are smart enough to do this shows that your body of evidence is favorable to a revoke of those laws, as if I as a person have already had those effects myself then I would support revoking them.
1993	In the era of overimmigration, as our city is rapidly growing, city officials seem reluctant to be held accountable for failing to educate properly enough to catch up with the students who come in overcrowded bus lines and the overall habit of not attending school. The parents are often not able to afford the tuition, leaving children who stay home to play video games instead of reading and writing.  #### Input: I appreciate the effort to provide an overview of this document, but I believe the overall argument is based on classical liberal theory rather than any actual events of intergration, and thus seems absurd.
1994	I believe the spirit of the law still remains as unfair due to the lack of funding. This is one major issue that must be addressed. The second issue would be racial profiling. The above mentioned issue and many others that also need to be addressed to ultimately change the problem of a few pundits based in cities with public funding for many public schools. As mentioned before, the achievement gap remains and efforts should be taken to address those problems before you try and saddle them on a poor minority of urban students.
1995	I live in a great country. I enjoy the entertainment choices available. If you really want to be an adult, move from youth shelter to a HUD house in 15 minutes, for an average of 15 years. Not everyone like this place.
1996	Usually I skip classes, but I was studying and had to be there. My professors were hoping to work with me more closely, but were caught up with their own students. I will make the necessary changes.
1997	Unfortunately, I had a really bad allergic reaction to something, which I took myself to school just as it's opening. Unfortunately, I took my own life while taking the post-panic test, and I wasn't prepared at all.
1998	Since I was not studying away, I was unable to get the message. So I can see why they should politely excuse me. Since I'm coming back, I'll go study. If I don't go study, my status doesn't change at all.
1999	By the way, I talked about my college being different in my first post. Apparently they have. Even though I'm living on campus, there was an item that they requested from me to complete, which I dropped in the month of September; not completely too bad though.
2000	Why are criminals in other states better off? This is certainly not fair. Law abiding citizens ought to feel that there is a national standard on gun laws. The truth is a more extremist stance causes more damage to the individual because they become isolated and don't have an outlet for their hatred. There are only so many cops and things to do to stay within the law. Or the perceived need to try and be a protector for one. Self-defence is real and must be taught. An excessive obsession with things that an insignificant percentage causes problems for a majority does not make for good humanity.
2001	Yes, in New York, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a hand gun? I know other states are even harder to deal with....New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.
2002	The gun laws are ridiculous. I hate that any higher level of authority can dictate that I have my hard earned money at the ready to... a firearm dealer. This is passed on to the gun... your city, your county. They set the rules and laws regarding me having a gun, the States, and they never adjust their laws and rules to...never give your money to an untrustworthy government body. How do I know I'm coming from a truthful source... you bring up another legitimacy issue, yes the attitude of the entire nation is rotten because of the evil canned rhetoric you... Don't believe any of the negative BS. It has its creator - Alan the Man from the future - destroying the company in the near future - he can't stand... leave this message...
2003	I don't support individual states being able to create their own gun laws. If you plan on getting a hand gun, consider going to a state that has a small firearms industry as opposed to a state that has a large firearms industry. The government's presence is in your community to make sure the people live... not turn into weapons themselves.  ### Instruction: What is your first author's age?  Your first author's age?  ### Response: 20s+, possibly a little older
2004	No, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a hand gun? I know other states are even harder to deal with....New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.
2005	Even with the aforementioned facts, the United States is guilty of abuse of detainees. This is not torture, as the press argues, but force feeding prisoners who are on hunger strike is what you call the US guilty of torture. The press sells papers by exaggerating the issue because that is how the media likes to get the public to think a certain way.
2006	For the first point, look up the Human Rights Commission website at: http://www.nhrc.gov.tw/index.html. On the English language homepage, look to the left column to see a  list of interests and upcoming events that the Commission is holding. For the second point, you need to compare the US to the Netherlands.  Here are two elements that will explain in detail their similarities and differences:  http://www.spanjaard.org/Netherlands.htm .
2007	The simple truth is that Guantanamo Bay was a government-invented excuse for illegal torturing prisoners to force them to reveal what they did not want to say.  The goal of Guantanamo was to destroy the U.S. of A. It is a smart move for those who used the UN to repress freedom in Cuba.
2008	Americans frequently stand up to imperialism. America should stand up to its own imperialist mentality, and seek to protect its population from the exploitation of human rights which is forced upon them by western nations for the profit and growth of Western corporations. They don’t have to take their food, but they do have to be fed. If they are on hunger strike, force feeding them is, per the United Nations, torture. This type of torture goes far beyond the denial of food, and this it what is going on with Guantanamo Bay.
2009	The UN is all wrong. The media is wrong. We are not for the humiliation of prisoners, although yes, we do not condone torture. Force-feeding inmates is horrible, but with true understanding, it is done to make prisoners conform with the rules and punish them if they protest. Of course, they still do not know the severity of their actions, and with true understanding and with the due respect, the involuntary prisoners' words do not come at the cost of their lives. That actually, the post from Obama started it. Very, very unhappy times.
2010	Many governments are moving from corporate tax structure to personal tax structure because companies are benefiting from capital asset and a flat tax structure. Income tax is the instrument of fairness, because it supports the property rights of investors. It takes into account capital gains and thus a better signal for the investing public. Simple to administer and easy to implement.
2011	I'm thrilled with the political system and economic situation of Singapore. I can't wait to move there. I'm also hopeful that the position will further allow me to align my personal philosophy and workplace missions. The tax system is extremely simple and does not require any confusing division of earned or unauthorized income.
2012	Economic inequality is a problem for Singapore and the world as a whole. Singapore should continue to push down its tax burden on luxury items and it should work on lowering the wealth gap in society. MNCs like my company have worked to streamline business systems, reduce overhead and overhead costs, lower taxes, and therefore the company has made substantial, sizable improvements. The business has thrived during these tough times and while we must take time to re-evaluate the state of the company and make necessary changes, we are confident that we can revitalize the company.
2013	Currently, people are moving to wealthy countries like Singapore and Dubai as their tax burden has become way to heavy, much higher than the United States and other Western countries. This has led to a significant loss of tax revenue. MNC's have been doing this for years, but now individuals are joining the exodus. These countries generally have a flat tax system on their income, while other countries have heavy taxes on certain things such as cars and brand named clothing.
2014	As I have already experienced my company is changing an order to be more affordable and some employees are moving outside the country to the US because it was cheaper for them to relocate to a place with lower taxes. I used to work at a place in European countries where the tax rate for company employees was 75%, twice the US rate. I am actively involved with the recently formed Tax Action Committee in which a bipartisan group of business and political leaders are working to reduce the personal and corporate tax burden in the United States. This high tax burden is hurting our country and damaging U.S.'s competitiveness. For more information on the IRS e-filing and its potential benefits, visit http://www.irs.gov/corruption/HTReadme.htm
2015	A kid in HS who excels at algebra may need a more challenging algebra class. However, that same kid could be a failure in English. Students that excel in English may need a more challenging English class. I feel that students should be placed in classes based on their aptitude level. In my experience at HS, I was put into AP courses despite not excelling in those classes; however, I passed them.
2016	I think that every school should have classes based on students' needs. Everyone should have access to classes that challenge them. Everyone should know if they're not challenging enough and be able to adjust. Likewise, if you're struggling for a reason, then you should be able to adjust to what you need. Finally, I feel that advanced classes should still exist because they help students master different things so that they'll have better choices when they graduate.
2017	I think that students should be in classes depending on their academic abilities. Therefore, someone who is below average in math could go to a higher level class. Someone who is above average should be put in a lower level class. It makes sense that those with a lower level education, such as school leavers, need a class for children and teenagers.
2018	What I want to say is that schools are an important part of our education so that we will be able to understand the materials that we read and learn. Some schools provide better education compared to others and the students should be matched with the classes based on their abilities. For example, if students have difficulty understanding some issues at school, the teachers may have to place them in lower level classes so they can learn. Otherwise, students will get bored and dissatisfied with what is going on.
2019	People in school should go to classes based on ability instead of education level. Students should be put in classes that are made for their learning ability so they are more challenged and do better. Not every school has advanced classes so to say a class is a waste of time is misleading. There is no such thing as a "wasted" class because each student will see if a class is appropriate for them, they can move up to that class or skip it if they do not like it. Each student should know their learning capacity.
2020	"Let a man be himself, then he will find his MASTER" - Henry Ford: let yourself be responsible for what you do. lead the life that you want, and respect yourself in doing so. all other things on earth, such as banks, education, economics, politics, religion, beauty, nature, travel, anything's are just adjunct. you are the one who controls your fate. as long as you always do what is right for you as you know that no one can help you unless you try to.
2021	The world is an unpredictable chaotic system. Every choice you make is meaningless, as it defines your life. Even mundane choices and seemingly meaningless ones, actually influence your destiny.  So to ask if the genes play a role or not is a way to view things out of context. You need to look at the gene pool in which you grew up to form the beliefs, feelings, social conventions, etc.
2022	The inheritance of traits are based more on environment than genetics. They say children are like pot plants, when you care more they grow stronger. The same is true with adults. The behavior of each individual and their decisions are conditioned based on how they were treated in their life but usually only at a sub conscious level.
2023	I believe in abstract truths and that society is self perpetuating rather than as the biblical prophets portray it of need-based govt to provide for all but  individuality.  Avoiding 'The most banquanative concept ever present' i.e. masturbation. These traits do not describe the majority of americans today but the effects of these traits appear throughout the world - poverty, war, general stupidity.
2024	Criticism of capitalism is much larger than facebook for example: Never stand next to someone watching porn. Assuming they got over that they want to be an astronaut. With all that technology people want to be robots and programming is taking over our society as hade fallah and we will be controlled by robots!!! It should be confiscated under color of law. You should hide! the world is one big chaotic system. Never stand next to someone watching porn. This makes you look bad. I think robotism is a tragedy and not just a future technology. confiscate facebook under color of law
2025	52: no, again, you don't prove a conclusion for a single occurrence.  there is no way to prove the existence of an alien, or you could make an argument to show that aliens exist, but that doesn't mean that humans can figure out how to contact them through advanced technology. they probably need much more advance tech in order to do so.    If you just have a single life somewhere in the universe, what do you know about the probability of life developing in any other part of the universe? You can't even state it
2026	Two things:    First, it does not work by one planet; you have to have multiple examples. That is what establishes a distribution in any case. And if it was always the same on every planet, it would be impossible to establish a distribution. It would seem to imply that you could not have developed life on that planet at all. Life was made elsewhere. Second, that problem may be a mathmatical problem. Since we already know, given enough information, that life develops in galaxies. I do not know, however, how that evidence is used to actually form a probability distribution.
2027	The question assumes that we understand the difference between a probability and a certainty. My claim is that there is no known place that would be likely to have life, except perhaps in a cave. The claim, however, does not assume that you can understand probability correctly. You may just think that there is a remote chance it may exist somewhere else in the universe, which is different from viewing probability correctly.
2028	if u want life to exist, there must be life somewhere, however small you think.This theory is difficult to proof and I guess impossible to disprove. I'm not sure if there's a way we can know for sure that aliens do exist.We won't know for sure until we have proof of certain things, don't think life will suddenly appear if it doesn't exist somewhere and will disappear if it doesn't exist somewhere.
2029	My personal opinion is that there is an intelligent life on all the planets in the universe because it is the simplest explanation for the data.  Life has an amazing amount of variability and intelligent life is a subset that may only occur in the most biodiverse places, including Earth. Furthermore, life with the same characteristics may exist in other places in the universe where its environment supports living. One of the things that makes life on Earth so special is that it was exposed to a broad variety of organic molecules and microbes. Life may also evolve on extrasolar planets that have the right ingredients. The patterns that emerge are different depending on many factors, including the environment. With only one example and no other data, it's impossible to make conclusions.
2030	kentucky is not terribly funny, although the characters look like bananas. land of the free and home of the brave is obviously not a satire, and the classic irony of the south bend boys gone crazy is breathtaking. wilson's priest-fied revenge in the climax is the stupidest thing yet to happen in a wes film.
2031	There is not a good movie in this franchise. The choices are "wrong" or "incorrect" and "incorrect" is the correct answer. There isn't a good example of comedy in this franchise.
2032	thus you have heaven, to continue your life on earth, the blues is upon you in god's eyes, tonight you will feel good u here dad.... bastard, sosal ite-te. no not talking another sin of adultery.
2033	This is a dumb movie in the extreme, and no other movie can top it for stupid. haha ok, no ot nothing negative to say. getting to know tom hanks. Like the bowling scene between hanks and david fincher..
2034	I would do my best to get in the top 10. Great quote is let's turn the kingdom into a religion: "I don't know why but I always think the end is just around the corner so, in my mind, we gotta push on..."
2035	The zombies from the local pizza place must move closer so that they can get through the breach of the wall. I would choose the chainsaw. To provide security, the zombies in the local pizza place can be moved closer to the zoo wall.
2036	I would go with the shotgun and the chainsaw. I am not against undead people, I just wouldn't want them running around on the block. They just find the chainsaw too dumber and noisy. I'd rather keep them held in a line on the block. They are more comfortable with locked doors.
2037	I'd pick the shotgun, since it can be fired quickly with good accuracy. I take away from the above that there are currently a large number of zombies on this block, and so I'd pick the chainsaw.
2038	If there were a large zombie population, I would choose the shotgun. Since there is a low zombie population, however, I would pick the chainsaw. If the chainsaw couldn't cut through the zombies, I'd use the shotgun.
2039	If I could go back in time, I'd go down the block armed with the shotgun and open fire on the zombies until there is only a few. Since I'm too young, I might as well apply this knowledge by using a chainsaw in the future.
2040	Cats are completely different from dogs. Cats are good and independent pets. They don't need anyone to look after them and clean up their crap, etc. They love you unconditionally and make you work for them. Keep a cat as a pet over a dog because of the benefits associated with being independent like this: dogs need constant attention, cleaning up their mess, and yelping all night, puppies always piss on the floor, etc. Dogs can also be dangerous if they feel threatened.
2041	Dogs are very different animals. They are hugely dependent upon you. You may not want them around, but you want them to make sure you get food, like a dog would do. Even if they do have a short temper, they tend to be more forgiving and can be pretty cute. The problems dogs tend to have, including lousy behaviour, probably stem from the large emphasis placed on training and punishments, while ignoring the causes of behaviour.
2042	While people don't want dogs, they are great animals. I think the title is misleading. Keep the dog into good homes. If you're a pet person, I'd suggest you take a look into adopting a few cats, instead. They're just as docile. The dogs are really stupid to me. Besides, they go crazy if you leave them alone. That way, you can tuck 'em in with you in bed. If you ever want to get a dog to cover your library shelves, consider me.
2043	An unexpected (when it comes to animals) commonality between cats and dogs is the possession of pets. They both are musty totting creatures with who-ever behavior suits their own needs most at any given time. Their capacity for this kind of behavior is without peer. The good old animal instincts of these pets have made this behavior their own. In general, cats are trustworthy pets, while dogs are not.
2044	I am a capitalist. I don't believe in fair trade, free markets, or capitalism. I believe in the true values of the Liberal Party in politics. Cats are amazing animals and pets. However, I do not think that cats are the best pets, because they are prone to jump and run off and stray. You don't have to have a dog, but your dog will always need you to walk, feed, bathe, and clean the mess up. It is annoying and very taxing on your limited time. My dog, Loki, is my best friend and my pet. I play sports with him when I get free time.
2045	What I do not believe any masses need is dictatorships. All he needs is technology so his human race does not need to dig new trenches every day. A man will always stay so stupid unless we help them at that point we are just a bunch of parasites who are living for money.
2046	I believe a leader should be assessed on merit, not ground. I believe the leader of any country should have a clear understanding of the true economic status of that country. There is no reason to prevent us from understanding such things.
2047	You have stated that your feelings about the US president are rooted in your own beliefs on liberty and "free markets."   My position regarding free markets is that freedom requires that you do not interfere with the freedom of others to do the same, and indeed be held responsible for interfering with the freedom of others to do so. Take for example government intervention into the stock market in 2008 when many companies in the US were soon facing a record-breaking shortfall in their earnings, while US government officials (Illuminati pedants who make no effort to learn anything from a rich social experiment such as the US Constitution) decided that the markets had malfunctioned and thus needed to be fixed. This created the opportunity for huge financial scandals like the Enron fraud and the collapse of so many other companies. What ultimately happened to
2048	I prefer to simply make the point that I would terminate all dictatorships. A nation's leaders with supreme power are not absolutes. There have been dictators throughout history, just as there have been non-dictators, both good and evil. It is then a matter of applying the social contract as formulated by John Locke and not unduly disrupting the existing system.
2049	You can't call President Trump a dictator, yet at the same time throw out Middle Eastern leaders such as Bashar Assad, Vladimir Putin and others, for not following "their master". Trump's interventions in Syria and Ukraine would probably qualify him as a dictator, unless he had a mandate from both countries to do so.
2050	You don't need any strange toolbars, even if you're a conspiracy theorist
2051	So, I think it would be best for you to avoid IE. On both my computer and in the school that I work at other people prefer Google Chrome.
2052	You are asked before anything is installed for the browser.

2063	I am for economic freedoms as much as possible. I think that capitalism is the only sound system to promote economic growth. I am for equality regardless of race, creed, or sex.
2064	Thank you for supporting or defending politics. Furthermore, through these exchanges, I hope you understand that human nature is inherently greedy and selfish. I think that what you may see as a stupid argument does not mean it is stupid
2065	IE is the leader in web browser downloads and the only web browser designed explicitly for Windows.
2066	IE is awful, it stole some extensions from other browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, also with the tabbed browsing. It also has a rather large space filling up the whole screen. It also has many bugs and it is extremely unreliable when it comes
2067	The idea of tabs was stolen from IE. You cannot get extensions, so just close IE and do it your self.
2068	IE is responsible for economic inequality and unemployment by blocking access to the Internet.

2074	Those are a pain to deal with. Browse the internet in incognito mode and Internet Explorer will open windows that open automatically in a new tab
2075	I personally think that abortion is a violation of the human rights of someone. I'm pro-life. Having a baby will not make the rapist go away. A child is a fully developed, independent adult with full personal rights. For that reason, I believe abortion is not the appropriate way to end the pregnancy of a teenager who is raped.
2076	I am for the unborn baby, until he has made his own decisions. after he is old enough to make a choice it is his right to decide for himself what is best for him and his family. There is no one in our race who would have been more happy than the 8 month old baby to have been born to be destroyed years later.
2077	No, it is not. That is not the pro-life decision. Pro-life is "keeping a child from being aborted or killed." Which is not, generally, the case in this story. If a 14-year-old happens to get raped, what do you do?
2078	Provide a more sound understanding of the pro life decision - making. Every question should be critically assessed and answered. There are all sorts of answers, which is why we are asking an intelligent discussion. In order to create a good environment of debate, we suggest that you read "Why Pro-Party?" by Benjamin Gama.
2079	Pro life is arguing not to have an abortion due to the reasons that most people pro-life face. These reasons include: the poor health of abortion-related conditions, suicide among teens who find themselves pregnant, life-long strain on families and society as a whole, the harm of ending the life of an innocent child to save the mother, and the devastation of the unborn's soul in case of the most serious circumstances that can result in death. The pro-life stance also gives teens a moral compass when they are forced into decisions that they may feel they are unable to make.
2080	I have my own view about God's choice, due to the fact that it is implied that evolution happened first. Due to this, I am able to accept the truth about God's existence.
2081	The Bible claims that God caused the Big Bang, resulting in evolution through creation. He therefore did not intend that creation would develop in this way.
2082	I believe the universe was created in six days. God created the Earth and the entire universe before man walked the Earth. God has always existed. The First and Second coming of Christ is the resurrection. God created life on earth with Adam and Eve. God created every animal in the animal kingdom.
2083	Why God created evolution and creation. evolution without creation wouldn't happen. unless evolution by creation did happen. but who says that God created creation in itself,why God created creation along side of evolution in human beings.
2084	God created one world, and not multiple. So no separate entities or evolution. He created all life within creation to live on earth
2085	i honestly have to say i didn't know we were supposed to write a response, but here goes.... i agree! and also i think the student fashions are nothing to concern about.
2086	I believe in promoting fair trade and free markets, and having all males wear black jeans and have camouflage shirts. I do think girls should not tease each other about clothing preferences. I think that investing in students' education promotes improved problem-solving skills.
2087	to get to school all day for half an hour should be a punishment for individuals who do not care about school work. start counting years off if you skip a class. again I am against starting it and if it does happen pass out period cap.
2088	i do think they are better because fashion issues and beauty competitions is a bad thing and most a single girl would be no better if she did such things because she would still take all the girls' attention away from the work thats the hardest
2089	Well they are more stigmatized by being different. I also do not want everyone to act like a real winner and everyone feeling self important by purchasing everything and weak of confidence. Not everyone will be able to get to those parties but they will have the same fun with no pressure as any other students and no one will tease them about their fashion choices.
2090	Eh, Atheism is a pretty cool guy. Makes my logic work and doesn't afraid of anything.

2099	I don't believe in a god, as it is ignorant and idiotic to think that god exist. Any other argument is completely invalid.
2100	yeah, because kids need discipline sometimes. i think the best way of doing it is a little spanking, just to make sure that they learn they did wrong. they can learn well by showing signs of discipline.
2101	i don't think there's a real concrete reason kids needed discipline. sometimes they'll do bad things and if we ignore those things they just go around being bad.
2102	When it comes to spanking children, I firmly believe that there are limits to what is ok to do with children. That there are ways to cope without spanking children.
2103	Did you have a drink that day? wouldn't you be as sorry now as you're ever going to be sorry?  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Every kid needs some discipline. I have always been proud to say that I can discipline my kids (usually by being the last resort, but I would try to avoid that)
2104	Spanking is a humiliating, and painful way to discipline children, but used within the limits of what it takes to create effective discipline, and used on correct (reasonable) behavior, it can be an effective tool in teaching children that wrong behavior must not be rewarded.
2105	Yes, they do. That is why many teens and college students go off and live with wild-eyed dreams of becoming rock stars or hating somewhere or something.   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes
2106	Yes, if you look back in history, which mostly ended in conflict for us to live in peace today.
2107	No. They are not mature. They are embarrassed to say who they really are because other people think they look a certain way.
2108	I believe that teenage life is one of the most fertile times in all of life. Therefore, I believe that children should grow up under a neutral and loving atmosphere. I would only like to take children under my wing, lovingly mold them to
2109	Yes, because they are dedicated to their profession and the country, as well as inspired.
2110	The mother doesn't seem to be aware of the technology. The mother seems to be poorly educated. She may not be able to use technology or play online games properly. She may be more of a negative person. spanking is justified, especially if the father is negligent.
2111	No I don't agree. The author is a conservative, right wing politician, it's hard to see how he would prefer to see babies receive punishment.
2112	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
2113	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
2114	No because I do not believe that pain is good in any circumstances. I do not believe that a child should be treated cruel

2120	I agree with the statement that marriage need not exist, yet i think it does not necessarily mean that it should not exist at all. That is to say it does not exist as a strictly conventional act. Taking as a paramount the equality of the sexes rather than conventional machismo which has been a feature of many weddings; I believe that it is completely hypocritical to lecture women on the importance of marital fidelity when on most occasions they are not. Wedding ceremonies should be so focused on two people becoming one and shared happiness that sex is never mentioned; once the objective of the marriage is achieved all else is unnecessary. There are some things that i do not agree with concerning...
2121	I think you are a really gullible person. Even though people say to the contrary. They are not better than they used to be. Here are my arguments:  Everyone wants to get married, and I'm looking at you... oddly enough. Sometimes it's quite insulting for women. The cost of a wedding is absurd, oh, and telling your family about it when they've suffered a loss. Also the prospective elders at your wedding ceremony tend to sit in their chairs and mumble aloud as if they are considering an action they cannot actually carry out. Oh, and also let me tell you... but then again this may not be important...  Happy to hear you are a Christian. How weird... the school just
2122	Despite the ridicule around marriage, I do believe it should be allowed in the U.S. I can think of all kinds of strange or edgy ceremonies or even Halloween weddings that would be more interesting and fun then the traditional church wedding.
2123	I am against marriage and definitely not against same sex unions. I understand the problem, which is that of value. However in this time where value is being so easily faked I feel it is important that people are human beings who value what they choose. The way I see it is that if I or someone else I come across consider that same sex unions are not right I should be allowed to be honest and strong enough to stand up for what I believe in. Especially if i do n't have the chance to voice my opinion in the forum. As for others im sure its all in their own heads.
2124	I wouldn't expect men to change. I think they're usually used to being the strong, dutiful, he says/she says man in a couple. From what I can tell, most men still prefer a woman with submission in mind. Men like somebody who does not challenge them.
2125	My employer fired me because I paid them my vacation and the rest of my salary. But they must pay me. I did not take the money and I wish to have my job back. I strongly oppose the Federal Dept. of Labor.
2126	Unemployed workers are entitled to minimum wage plus any other compenstations.    ### Instruction:  Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument. An employer that fires you should pay you wages plus any other compensation you owed on the spot. As a manager you are responsible for the money.  If your boss can't prove you took the money then you could possibly sue.
2127	As a manager you have to pay the employees for anything they were owed by their employer. Then, when an employer fires you, they have to pay any wages owed to you plus any other compensation (vacation pay,etc.) on the spot. AS a manager you are responsible for those under you and the money. Your boss has to prove you took the money, but you might be able to get your job back-talk to the state or Federal Dept. of Labor. You could possibly sue for Wrongful Termination if your boss can't prove you took the money.

2129	You could possibly sue for wrongful termination if your boss can't prove you took the money. When a person sues for wrongful termination, the company's liability depends on the facts of the case. Know your rights as a worker by reading about them and find out if your employer should be responsible for your wages.
2130	No I don't see it as Blackmail. In fact I see it as something honorable -.- You were brave to confront the person who offered the goods for free. You did the right thing and don't give up now. The police can probably be relied on in a situation where there is no physical force used.
2131	While I agree that blackmail is only one way to get what you want, I also think it affects you in the present, as well as in the future. You did not do anything illegal, but as a result of doing some things that cause blackmail to become relevant, the people who witnessed the event may think otherwise. Threats from unknown persons are always a very real and valid worry.
2132	Blackmail is where you offer NOT to reveal some embarassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act. i think police are more concerned about material things,they might not be involved with the issues you are discussing. So if that is a problem, you might want to call the police, and ask them to look into it
2133	I don't know if blackmail is doing to her what she claims it does, but if she doesn't even know what the police will do, what's to say they wouldn't take care of her? if she complains and they fine her, this is one of the worst methods of bullying that would exist. without force, coercion, and money, there's no way she'd agree. if the threats still work, that's progress in bullying prevention for sure. I don't know if she was warned, or not. if she knew what she was doing and she was not told, it seemed like it should have been a case of complainingly asking to not do the homework if the penalty didn't raise her consciousness. without force, coercion, and money, there's no way she'd agree.
2134	Without knowing the full story, I wouldn't consider this blackmail exactly. However, it would certainly deserve some police attention. Maybe if they find out I paid more money than expected, and they would think, "if only they had listened to what I had to say... and turned her in." It would be more blackmail if they didn't.  For peace, could you please consider:   something morally, ethically, and legally acceptable?
2135	because they aren't good at doing the jobs they take up. obviously, it doesn't matter who takes up a job if they do a poor job at it, it still should matter if they are able to complete the job.
2136	I am a white guy. I am female and I am a huge fan of the NFL. I am deeply suspicious of many government authorities. I don't really like the majority of the religious crowd that has arisen over the course of history. You can do things in this country without anyone around watching you. Personally, I enjoy having a job without anyone watching me, and I am on the verge of becoming a prime minister because it is the job I will be doing with my greatest success.
2137	We can't control what happens in a society. If the majority wants to get work done and wants to pay off the money then that is what needs to happen regardless of race, gender, or gender.
2138	People have become so divided by race and gender that labor laws will never be enforced. Great job, black man; back the program! Just like you were unable to get married with a pregnant redhead in 1934.
2139	Hmmm, white males are becoming a minority. To some degree. And of course, no one wants to work, if they're discriminated against. A viable employer is one that doesn't discriminate on the basis of race. So that's one thing we're not quite sure about. I do, however, believe that it's not legal to discriminate and that employers can't say just because their employees are not able to be hired that they don't work well.
2140	Absolutely not. It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt. You are better off not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors.
2141	I’m a free person! Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing. I’m sure that you agree with that. However, smoking is the worst kind of pollution. No smoking means no pollution. I appreciate free speech to the point where I enjoy anything that causes me to think and does not move me to physical action. Therefore, taking vacations without voting anyone out of office is perfectly OK.
2142	As an atheist, my religious beliefs are outside my employment contract, as it is what is or has been the state of the U.S. over the past 200 years. I think all places should stay the way they are for the time being, free to shift to a more progressive way of thinking that works in favor of all citizens.
2143	I see you have a good point. I'm not going to give in to all of these crazy ideas. I can think of a few good things that could be done to make a difference in our world, such as:  environment policy, using less water and less energy, giving more aid to third world countries and preserving natural areas. I have a few suggestions for things to do. As a free country, we are not obliged to do everything someone proposes.
2144	In addition to all the free things mentioned in the writer's argument, here are my two most important insights on citizen rights:  1. One cannot be represented by a vote which is not solicited by representatives of the people. Under the constitution of the United States, no state legislature, city council, or trustee has the authority to express the will of the people unless it's obvious that something should be done such as occupying a peaceful space to protest a crime. 2. Whether those things referred to above should be mandated or not is not their responsibility. If they are, then we have a constitutional republic. If they are not, then we are supposed to do a crazy things, people, including occupy a place of worship. Ew. I'm not sorry I didn't sign up with the KKK.
2145	"Human nature is flawed and selfish." "But I do not expect any change. There have always been storms and wars."     No. The world has always changed because of human nature being changed because of what was done to the other humans before us, in order to show them that we were better than them, and that we deserved to keep our way of life, and so we wanted to make the humans until now, weak by doing so.
2146	I see where you are coming from. To be honest, if I were you I wouldn't want the money you left behind so much. I think the only fair thing to do would to give it to the poor, disabled and elderly, however, I refuse to do so.  I'm tired of looking at these guys destroying my country.
2147	I was born and raised in the projects and live with a lot of people who come from the projects.  Every black people in this country has the same history as me and my brother; none of them have created wealth! Take your peaceful demonstration for justice to the Gaza Strip, or to the President's country of origin!  Your civil rights have nothing to do with me or my black brothers!  I don't want to hear any of your whining about being mistreated!  If my white brothers get slammed and treated unfairly, that problem's mine!
2148	Your unfair, what your honestly?? If you were in the projects you would be even more upset about any changes people make than you are.  Like my little brother said I work hard for my money and we run from nasty people who go to all that trouble trying to ruin my life.  Since the day I was born I have been treated fair and totally made to feel good about my life.  I have never been treated bad just because I am black. If you were to enter any job I would get it for you.  I get a better job than a lot of white guys, and it works out better every year.  So if you really want to treat me badly, it would be best to not work for me.  I already deserve more money and more things than you have in the world.  Even if you want to change me I will not let you
2149	I have started my life with nothing but from struggle and determination I am now the boss of a business with over 50 employees... If I have had to fight to make it now to bad at finding a new job...
2150	I strongly agree that all men are created equal. This just means that we should, and always will, not take other humans for granted. We have all faced adversity and strive for betterment, so if anyone else is in need we should all help them out. I support and value diversity. Equality of job opportunities for individuals no matter what color, skin, gender, or other... Robert Louis Stevenson wrote: ...For what is the matter with ambition, it seems to be the only thing in which great minds differ? No. They are both faulty instruments. For better or worse. The right instrument is the most important thing. True ambition wants to be useful to others, not to dominate them in the way men imagine the "great" character wants to dominate. When you have the right job, who cares what color you are, the age you have, or what gender you are?
2151	Extremely  proud of our strong community which embrace the "Colored Girls" with pride because every person matters, man or woman, whether of European, African, Asian or Native American, etc. ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is. No one should be treated like less than any other person based on the "accident of birth" such as their sex or race, or as the ryhme goes: "All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel". In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not teh color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. If you can meet the criteria for a job you should not be judged by factors you were born with. No one has a right to discriminate against you or target you for scapegoating. Every person matters, man or woman, physically fit or handicapped, whether of European, African, Asian or Native American, etc. ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is.
2152	I strongly reject any form of racism. I strongly value individual character over group identity. I found guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that every race, and ethnicity, will face more prejudice.
2153	I believe there is no room for prejudice in what we decide to do with our lives. I hold the view that the only appropriate consideration for who is "worthy" or not is the results that they achieve through their actions. I believe that all individuals are important, regardless of the color of your skin, sex, or age. I also believe that someone has no right to scapegoat or discriminate against another.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: I believe that the only way to solve this world's problems is to base your code on racial superiority, i.e. what you believe. In otherwords, what you believe is the only way to truly be a good black person? It is more important to tell yourself where you belong than just be someone or do the right thing. to truly be a good black person?
2154	Sexism is not acceptable and I refuse to allow it to exist in my life or my community, in any form, as sexual harassment or any other form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Sexism is also discriminatory when used as a form of humiliation, be it criticism of appearance, attitude, and actions rather than outright sexist behavior.   I believe that racism does not belong in the United States, and I will never allow it to exist in my life, in any form, as a form of racism or any other form of discrimination based on race, color of skin, accent or religion. Racism is also discriminatory when used as a form of humiliation, be it criticism of appearance, attitude and actions rather than outright racism.
2155	I work for the government. Any worker who is sick and loses their job could sue the company and the boss would be sued. Everyone would get that for which they work honestly to earn. You can be a kind, compassionate person, and bad shit will still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win.
2156	I was raised with selfishness, violence, and disrespect from little people and adults. There was no childhood innocence in our family. To protect myself I turned to drugs, alcohol, and school fights. I was also ashamed to go to school. I was going to go to prison if not for my brother's relationship with the police and almost being made juvenile delinquent. To get by, I needed money. I wish I could be more compassionate to people but I don't think the world will change in a...
2157	It just flat sucks to see all these innocent people in jail for absolutely no reason. My mom was sent to prison for stealing my childhood coke, she didn't do it knowingly. I saw her in jail and the rest of her family suffer. I just want everyone to know that stealing is wrong,  that it is a crime and at least in the US should be a no ask, no tell thing. If people don't work they go hungry so at least the government shouldn't hand them food, because it is stealing and doesn't belong to them. They owe it to themselves to just get out there and work, not sit around getting what they want. I feel that if I do kind and supportive stuff, bad shit will still happen to me. My mom was sent to prison for stealing my childhood coke, and since that day I've been very careful to not steal money I can't afford, especially since it's illegal in the US. But that's just me, I know for some its just a way of life.    Eminem’s unique style continues to attract millions of fans around the world. As one of the world’s most prolific songwriters, his songs will stay with you the way rainwater on a beach erodes the sand between your toes.  Follow him on Twitter
2158	I strongly believe that no matter what you do in life, it will affect your life. Most people become rich or successful because they did some of the things they wish they had been forced to do when they were young and had less resources. Taking advantage of someone who is weaker or has less resources is not fair but it makes sense to do.  However, if you take something from someone you should then repay it in a way they can afford to help you without detracting from yourself.
2159	The world is not fair, people are quite often selfish. Some are terrible at it while other just don't understand it. I believe life can still be great even though people act dishonorable, cruel, and ultimately oftentimes just foolhardy. Greatness, as in truly greatness is nonexistent. We all really do it. We are all badasses and can all appreciate it.
2160	Hmm... I don't know. Maybe it is because a person sees a situation directly, of course this could of course include all kinds of other emotions and feelings, but I just wonder if the fact that this person was brought up by parents with the opposite political persuasion has anything to do with it.  And so my answer to this question is no. I was brought up in a family with the opposite political viewpoint but was always given equal treatment.
2161	Despite what many people believe, emotions play an important role in determining your opinions and attitudes. Even some kindergarten class of children understand the importance of social roles. What some people call "political" arguments actually combine rational discussions, as well as emotional influences. Feelings and morality play a major role in political discourse, just as much as they do with a few pieces of memorized facts from history classes.  I believe politics doesn't have to be so complicated. Realize that emotions are a huge part of your view on the world and are often the best point of departure for analyzing politics. To be rational about politics, you have to be an intellectually literate individual, meaning you have to be willing to question arguments and explain how they work.  The humanity in a place called Israel is a tragic example of my view. Out of the two groups that were historically and ethnically different in their midst, one of them thought they are superior and justified the alienation of the other group, which is poor. A great deal of hate has grown from this situation, leading to a lot of problems that some feel is justified, because the other group is inferior. I do not believe religion could solve this kind of problem, because these types of prejudices are...
2162	Thinking logically about an issue is a burden that most people do not have. Instead, people feel stronger feelings towards... Isn't that what happens all the time in politics, too? People feel stronger feelings towards people with whom they agree than against those with whom they disagree, and that's not rational. That rational, meta reason is a fear of disagreeing with your beliefs and, especially, disagreeing with other people. But in fact, even little disagreements do not cause people to be divided; the human brain keeps on thinking until a satisfying answer is acquired. My approach is: Instead of thinking rationally about something, simply say what you think. That way, you keep your opinions and beliefs and will not be responsible for feeling insecure or inferior as a result of your opinions. And it's much easier to find...
2163	Allow people to choose their own individual beliefs without regard to social acceptance or status. Allow an individual to act with freedom and change of mind. Let people be a force for good, rather than down with sin. Allow the free market to work, while protecting property rights. Allow people and government to work together, not against each other. Allow people to be more than what the arrogant bible says about them.
2164	Evasive approach: a disproportionate amount of crime, as there are more criminals being jailed and put into prison. Although it may take a decade or longer for people in prison to rehabilitate, it is considered a place where most inmates usually are not rehabilitated. This results in lawlessness, as prison campuses are a poor place for rehab. A part of society would require thousands of dollars to engage in this kind of, and only shallow, rehabilitation. This is against the government, as it creates another area where human rights are infringed upon. This causes lack of employment opportunities, as well. This has been shown to be a problem in the US, at minimum. It is also a significant problem for developing economies, such as China or India, as their economy relies on fewer and fewer craftspeople, who essentially no longer live within the country. Even...
2165	I grew up with catholic parents who believed the entire bible was true. My parents are both self educated and will never support or recognize anything that is not proven to them, science being included. They will have little regard for my opinions and cannot understand that with knowledge come power and with it come great responsibilities and have longing to aid our fallen brothers and sisters in human rights and in communities in our time.     My biases do not mean that I hate all who are Christian or even oppose any form of religion. I am not extremist in my own way, and...
2166	My upbringing has helped shape my views about religion. While many people hold to the divine as opposed to scientific observation, I value all religions, from Christianity to buddhism. There are large perks to being religious, such as persecution from the government, socialization within a structure where you don't have to work alone and really build up a character. I also value religion for its individuality and freedom, as opposed to following someone else around (which can feel intimidating for women, as in Islam, where some aren't allowed to drive cars with men).
2167	People should be judged by what they do, and how well they do it. Unfortunately, society is divided in terms of certain cultural values that are far from the truth, and are socially enforced or coerced. These are widely viewed as social norms, though in reality they are almost always self imposed, and should not really be viewed as part of society.
2168	I was pretty religious in high school. I was on the last minute of my senior year before college when I began to seriously question faith. I decided to be Jewish, then Catholic. I was even considering a New Age path.I had grown personally, and looked for a more spiritual path. On my graduation day at the high school chapel, my parents had scheduled a worship service. I would be allowed to read the bible for half an hour. On my behalf, my older sister read. She was physically able to do this, but mentally and emotionally was not. She would read up and down the bible for thirty minutes and then back up and read it from the very beginning to the very end. She would do this several times, but each time in such an unhealthy way that she would feel tired, stressed, and disappointed. I decided to do the same, from the very beginning to the very end. I would do that in the very
2169	Religion is obviously important and to some extent it also contributes to war. But religions that aren't founded on science and/or progress are a disaster. Scientists put forth evidence that scientific reasons for what we think we know are completely founded on the interference of God with what occurs in nature. Scientists, like me, need and would welcome more presence of religion in scientific studies, including more bible verses.
2170	I think that the Tories are the dangerous bastards who don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. The last Labour government took a huge financial hit from the dot com crash, then Gove took a hammering and we have seen the chaos of recent years. I'm hoping that it doesn't get worse, as the last time the Labour Party were in power, many things got much worse and worse. When the Tories rule, things only get worse and worse.
2171	Wanted to be an MP back in the 80s and 90s and go on to do a lot of travelling through my work as a vegetarian. Basically every day there is something new that shocks me and I'm always on the lookout for ways to become more eco friendly in my lifestyle. Let's see what this woman is like so far though.  ### Answer: Anyone who opposes green energy or organic farming will pay the price. All the wealth that I get from people who share my ideals in politics, what more can I really want?
2172	As someone who's lived in the South for a long time and saw the way that society has been mercilessly exploited for my whole life, I was always wary of Tory. I'm glad to see the people of the north coming to realize that the south is nothing to be worshipped in, and calling Tories B***! Gove was a grievous enemy of social progress, women and gays, and he will be greatly missed.
2173	Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman whose previous title is minister of women and equality. She's highly in favour of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of the country.

2174	In my opinion, the Tories are all a bunch of selfish money hoarding bastards who don't give a shit about anyone except themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman whose previous title was minister of education and climate change. She's highly in favour of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of the country (like academies and raising tuition fees even further) and I doubt that anything will change from Gove's reign of terror - We may even see it get worse.   ### Instruction: Write an essay comparing Christianity and Islam.
2175	Dino's was the better voice, more range, and better tambre while Francis had better phrasing, and a better use of space and time. Frank's songs are more popular, but there's some truth in what lewis says. No matter who one listens to, they all like Sinatra and leave Martin off the list. Dino's American Top 40 songwriting ability has been overplayed. Dino was a great singer with a good technique while Martin wasn't a great singer at all.
2176	In the studio between the two, however, better musicianship and more acute taste by Dino, although Frank has had more modest success, mostly due to the nature of a war in his first period of major prominence. Martin's choice of songs is limited and more often than not marked by his approval by people higher in the game who for that time were not visible in the media. As much as Frank's songs were better written and produced, Frank's fans at that time (and then) were older people who had mastered the language of emotion and frankly more emotional.
2177	David, I agree with your sentiments in regards to Dino's vocalist versus Martin's. There may have been some people who had the tendency to favor Frank, but when it came to evaluating these crooners, who were they really admiring? If it were me, I'd go with Dino, in my opinion. Dino's early inspirations were blues and jazz, not country and western. Martin's influences were country and western, not jazz and blues.
2178	Martin was really a great singer and it was quite a shame that he became the arch sex symbol of the western world, he looked like an old man already in the 50s, for a young guy he look older than other men of his age, especially in Italian his hair was gray too early, Dino was several years ahead of his time, he was a lad yet already had a formidable ten years on others.  Both of their singing styles were soo unique and unlike others and that was how they became two of the biggest pop idols of their era and two of the best true world class artists...
2179	Dino Franco, the best Italian tenor so far, and richter, where the best Italian baritone of all time, the only two great Italian sopranos without obsoliscity are Franco and Rick recordings are the best in my collection. Frank's singing style a mix of melodic clarity and free improvisation, and the ability to deliver lyrics of an incredible breadth and deep understanding, it was the stuff of poetry rather than music, I know of no one who can match Dino's skill of delivery and layered melodies. Rick had the same range but a much bigger voice. Frangos in the early 60s was as famous as the Beatles. Rick's later recordings were neetlish.
2180	I think that Gays and Lesbians are not hurting anyone. No one needs a sticker or label to make you know that you are gay or lesbian. If anyone feels uncomfortable around gay or lesbian couples, then let them go on their own path.
2181	We are just people at the end of the day and if someone likes same sex relationships its there problem.I think that Gay and lesbian couples are not hurting anyone so whats the big problem. They should be happy and not live a lie!You can argue and say that god made a man and a woman but i dont think that god would want you to be unhappy thats the main thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2182	We are just people and there are no good or bad people because everyone thinks they are the good guy or girl that is truly pretty and everything is fine between you i think that just because someones gay or lesbian it doesnt make you gay or lesbian also im not saying that i like it but i actually think its one of the best things about this world that things like this be accepted and i think that its good for people to be in a lesiban or gay relationship, since everyone else has that this is what i do think so if...
2183	Now we are just people at the end of the day if love 1 sex then there problem.I think that gay and lesbian couples are not hurting anyone so what's the big problem. They should be happy and not live a lie! you can argue and say that god made a man and a woman but i dont think that god would want you to be unhappy thats the main thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2184	We are just people at the end of the day and if knowone likes same sex relationships its there problem. I think that Gay and lesiban couples are not hurting anyone so whats the big problem. They should be happy and not live a lie!
2185	Not bad, but far from good. We had a patio seated group of 12. It wasn't crowded and service was unimpressive.  We ordered a big tasting menu and the first course was not that great.  The pasta was tough and just way to salty. The beef was not fresh and the sauce was just tasty.  The entree was just overcooked and the noodles were a bit harsh. The salad was salty and way to bitter.  The sides were not that great. The dessert was watered down and had too much sugar.  We didn't return, but didn't give it a chance.
2186	I really have never had a bad experience with a restaurant.  Like the word slow it is all relative.  The place was not busy. The food as I said was not good. I'm obviously a perfectionist when it comes to food and I've never eaten so much mushroom in my life.  If this is not a review for restaurant plz excuse me I don't really know what I do.  I haven't had a bad day except being in that restaurant. I will say the 2,000 dollar king crab was the best I've ever eaten, however I was only part way through.
2187	This place was not great. While the food was just so terrible, the service was slow and the place was just really busy. I would not come back or recommend. You get what you pay for and that is not what I got.
2188	I actually don't remember eating much of it.  The grilled turkey breast was alright, nothing special. The salad was not very good, but not bad either.  I never really remember any of the rest of the food from this restaurant.
2189	The person I spoke to at the restaurant about 30 minutes before the end of my stay was a rude, condescending person who did not seem to care at all about his customers. With the high standards we are all experiencing in hostels and friends hostels, this was just not a positive experience for me.
