arg35748,"Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.",Is it better to have a lousy father or to be fatherless,1

arg168818,"To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more competent leader.",William farquhar ought to be honoured as the rightful founder of singapore,1
