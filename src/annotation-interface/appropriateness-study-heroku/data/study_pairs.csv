","We have had good experiences at Carpe Diem in the past, however our most recent visit was a disappointment. While we understand that restaurants can have off nights, the food was overseasoned and cooked, the steak was overcooked and the quail was difficult to eat due to the rice. The wine was also overpriced.   The food was lacking in flavor compared to our previous experiences and the atmosphere did not make up for it. We did appreciate the table decoration for our anniversary, but it was disappointing not to receive a glass of wine, an appetizer, or a dessert to commemorate the occasion.   Overall, it was an expensive meal which did not live up to our expectations. We would recommend trying the restaurant at another time, as the inconsistency of the food may have been due to an off night.

Since you have not done so, it is important to consider both sides of the argument. Until more evidence is available, it is difficult to definitively determine the truth.   It is also important to consider that evolution is not limited to a single theory, but can incorporate a variety of factors. Therefore, it is necessary to look at all the available evidence in order to draw a definitive conclusion.  This can help to better inform our understanding of the topic.  This helps to provide a more comprehensive view of the issue.  It is important to keep an open mind and consider both perspectives before reaching a conclusion.

","In the past, children were more likely to roam freely in their neighbourhoods, allowing them to visit local shops such as candy stores or even school. While this provided more opportunities for children to explore and gain independence, it also led to new risks as child abduction and exploitation became more common.

Finally, uniforms can help prevent security risks as they can help differentiate students from other civilians, making it easier for authorities to quickly identify the students in an emergency situation. This could be particularly beneficial in times of war or unrest, where terrorists may try to pose as civilians to gain access to targets.

It would also save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer, as well as decrease the amount of money spent on treating smoking-related illnesses. This would be beneficial for both healthcare providers and patients.   Despite the potential financial impact to the cigarette industry, it would be beneficial in the long run as it would decrease the number of people who become ill due to smoking.

","In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and money. It would also save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer, as well as decrease the amount of money spent on treating smoking-related illnesses. This would be beneficial for both healthcare providers and patients.   Despite the potential financial impact to the cigarette industry, it would be beneficial in the long run as it would decrease the number of people who become ill due to smoking. I believe this would be beneficial for everyone involved.   Whilst I recognize the potential impact on jobs, I believe that the benefits of decreased smoking-related illnesses would outweigh the costs. This could potentially result in fewer people smoking and a subsequent decrease in the prevalence of these illnesses.   Therefore, I believe that making cigarettes illegal would be beneficial overall.

Unions contribute to politicians less than corporations due to rules governing union dues, so having the ability to fund pro-union politicians could provide a healthy counterbalance. When politicians try to limit my right to assemble and voice my grievances, it can feel very much like certain states which restrict labor organizations. This can be a challenge for workers' rights and I believe there needs to be greater balance in the system.

Is it better to have a lousy father or to be fatherless?

Argument:

I believe that having a father figure in one's life is invaluable. Regardless of whether the father is exemplary or flawed, their presence carries significant weight. For young boys, fathers often serve as mentors and confidants in discussing male-related issues. Even if a father is far from perfect, there's a certain reassurance in knowing they're there, and their experiences, good or bad, can provide valuable life lessons.","I wouldn't feel fulfilled in life if I didn't get to meet my father. Whether he's a good or bad father is irrelevant, as most fathers are friends to their sons, and can relate to their boy better than a mother can. This allows sons to open up to them about male-specific problems and get advice from a trusted source. It's an essential part of growing up, and something that can't be replaced by anything else.

The Venetian doesn't charge for Valet. They are so greedy at Mandalay Bay. It's the MGM corporation in general. All their hotels are doing this.

Issue:
Business Review: 1.0 stars for Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, under the categories of resorts, arts & entertainment, restaurants, hotels, hotels & travel, event planning & services, and casinos.

Argument:
The exorbitant valet fees of $16 for the first 2 hours are truly concerning. The hotel's justification that patrons are using parking for airport purposes appears dubious. Furthermore, they claim to share this fee with the valet, eliminating the need for tipping. This practice is disheartening, particularly given the negative publicity this establishment has received. It's worth noting that The Venetian, a neighboring competitor, does not charge for valet services. This practice reflects poorly on Mandalay Bay, and one can't help but wonder if it's indicative of a wider trend within the MGM corporation. It's worth mentioning that parking at the shopping center valet at Mandalay is a free alternative, although it may seem trivial to complain about this matter. Unfortunately, it underscores the broader issue of how casinos often seem to overcharge for various services, leading to a flood of patrons seeking free parking at the mall.","Mandalay Bay is charging exorbitant valet fees of $16 for the first two hours, which is outrageous. This is especially galling since the hotel claims it's to compensate for people using their parking for the airport, which is complete bullshit. People should not have to pay for parking when they're using it for a legal activity.  The Venetian doesn't charge for valet parking, which is great, but the other hotels in the MGM corporation are engaging in the same greedy practices. This is indicative of a larger problem with the corporation, which should be addressed.  Parking at the mall valet, however, is free, so people should take advantage of that and “flood” the parking lot to make their point. This is a silly problem to rant about, but it's important to highlight these unethical practices and make sure the hotel changes their policy.

","Even when the initial sentence was quite severe, it is true that non-violent drug offenders can often face longer prison terms than violent offenders. This can be unfair as it can mean that these offenders are placed in the same facilities as violent criminals, which can be a difficult situation. While it is understandable that these offenders may require specialized rehabilitation, it can be beneficial for them to serve shorter sentences overall. I understand that this can be difficult in some cases as it is difficult to know how an individual offender will respond to their sentence.

Why is marijuana illegal?

Rewritten Argument
The prohibition of marijuana can be attributed to several reasons. Firstly, concerns about its regulation by the government have led to its illegality, primarily due to difficulties in controlling and monitoring its distribution. Secondly, there is a prevalent perception that marijuana can serve as a gateway drug, potentially leading to the use of more harmful substances. Thirdly, the historical context, where it was illegal for a significant period in various countries, complicates the process of legalization. Legalizing it may trigger a surge in interest, resulting in higher healthcare costs due to its potential health risks, such as respiratory damage and impaired judgment. Additionally, it could have repercussions on workforce productivity. Moreover, the transition from an illegal market to a legitimate one may pose challenges for individuals who previously dealt in the illicit trade, potentially contributing to an increase in criminal activities, including gun sales and trafficking in more dangerous narcotics. These are some of the key factors contributing to the current legal status of marijuana.","It's not advisable to legalize marijuana because of its potential to be abused, its detrimental health effects, and the associated increased costs to the government in terms of healthcare and decreased labor quality. Additionally, legalizing marijuana may lead to an increase in other types of drug abuse and crime due to its availability. Finally, the economic impact of marijuana legalization on the job market has not been explored, and may have a negative effect on legitimate job seekers. Therefore, it is not a smart or feasible idea to legalize marijuana.

The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent.  Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death.  How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?  If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live?  Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.

Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  While capital punishment may not be the ideal solution in all cases, it does provide an important deterrent for violent crimes and ensures that the guilty are punished.  Abortion on the other hand, is an ethical and moral decision best left to the woman and her doctor.  It is important to consider the rights and wellbeing of both the mother and the unborn child when making this decision.  Ultimately, it is an intensely personal decision and one that should be made in consultation with medical professionals and trusted advisors.  Each case should be weighed independently as there is no blanket solution that works in all cases.  The primary goal is to ensure that justice is served in a fair and unbiased manner.

","To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared capital punishment to abortion:  Capital punishment can be a proper punishment for serious crimes, as it removes the criminal from society and prevents them from committing further crimes.  In contrast, abortion terminates a developing fetus, which is seen as a controversial practice in many societies.  Generally, if a person has been convicted of a malicious crime, capital punishment can be an appropriate punishment.  It is up to the government to put policies in place to ensure this does not happen erroneously.  However, this does not prevent capital punishment from being seen as an appropriate punishment in some cases.

","In recent years, moustaches have become increasingly unpopular in the United States due to their association with totalitarian regimes and a perceived lack of trustworthiness. This is partly due to the fact that moustaches have been largely absent from American culture since the 1960s, meaning that many of the symbols and memes associated with moustaches have become undesirable. For me, the first time I encountered the fingerstache meme was quite unsettling, as moustaches are still largely seen as a symbol of barbarism and a possible return to a more primitive way of life. Therefore, I believe that moustaches should be more carefully considered in order to ensure that the American public is not inadvertently being exposed to potentially dangerous symbols and ideas.

","I agree that no legal system is perfect, as court rulings are often subject to interpretation and arbitration. However, I am more comfortable with court systems that have an established legal framework, such as our own, rather than systems that rely on the input of a single leader, which raises questions as to the reliability of such judgments. For example, even though religious leaders often claim that god ordered their decisions, this has occurred only a few times in the last centuries, whereas court orders are much more formally established in many countries.

","I understand the situation can be difficult, as the cost of providing care for children in foster care can be high. However, it is important to remember that states are required to provide funding for these services, and some states may be able to provide more support for these cases than others. It is important to advocate for better services and more funding, as this can lead to improved outcomes for both children and parents.

It is understandable why people would want to tune in to watch Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid play against each other as it is likely to produce the most exciting and competitive matches, however, this can be achieved without compromising the development of the other teams in the league. For example, the teams could be split into divisions based on their current skill level, with the top teams playing each other more often and the bottom teams playing each other less often, giving every team a chance to reach the top. This would mean that there would be a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch, as well as providing the opportunity for a middle-of-the-pack team to reach the top.

Why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?","When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced. It is understandable why people would want to tune in to watch Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid play against each other as it is likely to produce the most exciting and competitive matches, however, this can be achieved without compromising the development of the other teams in the league. For example, the teams could be split into divisions based on their current skill level, with the top teams playing each other more often and the bottom teams playing each other less often, giving every team a chance to reach the top. This would mean that there would be a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch, as well as providing the opportunity for a middle-of-the-pack team to reach the top. Therefore, true parity could be achieved without sacrificing the competitiveness and excitement of the matches. In conclusion, why should I not prefer a structure that provides true parity, with every team having an equal chance of reaching the top?
","When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced.  I think it is beneficial to have a variety of teams that can challenge for the title as well as providing teams an opportunity to compete for the title. While having a few teams at the top may create more excitement among fans, it can also limit the number of teams capable of winning the title which can be beneficial. Ultimately it depends on the specific league and what type of balance can be achieved.

","Instruments have their limitations compared to a digital composition program, as they require more manual input to produce certain sounds. While this can be a drawback for some, it also allows for a greater degree of control over the frequencies of the sounds produced. This can be beneficial in allowing for more creative freedom when creating music. It does take more time and effort to learn how to use an instrument, but this can offer more flexibility and the ability to produce a wider range of sounds. While this may be a disadvantage compared to digital composition programs, it offers the ability to create unique pieces that would be more difficult to achieve with a program.

","Instruments have their limitations compared to a digital composition program, as they require more manual input to produce certain sounds. While this can be a drawback for some, it also allows for a greater degree of control over the frequencies of the sounds produced. This can be beneficial in allowing for more creative freedom when creating music. It does take more time and effort to learn how to use an instrument, but this can offer more flexibility and the ability to produce a wider range of sounds. While this may be a disadvantage compared to digital composition programs, it offers the ability to create unique pieces that would be more difficult to achieve with a program.

","Why not?  People have different beliefs about marriage and what is right or wrong.  Everyone should be respected and allowed to make their own decisions, regardless of their beliefs.  While some may feel that marriage should only be done within a religious ceremony, others may prefer to get married in a more civil manner.  As such, it is important to be respectful of all individuals and their beliefs.  Thus, those who feel uncomfortable with same-sex marriage should be open to attending such weddings, while also recognizing the right of others to make their own decisions.  Everyone should have the freedom to make their own choices, while still being respectful of others.

","I believe black people give society more of a bad name compared to white people, this is something I regularly see portrayed in the media. I'm not saying white people are completely innocent because they're not. ","I think that black people give a bad name to themselves more often than not, since so many negative things are associated with them. From the stereotype that all black people are criminals to the fact that you hardly ever see white people portrayed negatively in the media, it's clear that black people are portrayed in a negative light much more often. This can be seen by looking at statistics; half of all jails are filled with black people, while you hardly ever see white people portrayed in a negative light when it comes to crime.  Furthermore, rappers, who are overwhelmingly black, are often portrayed as criminals due to their music and are often associated with negative things. It's odd when you consider that country singers, who are almost always white, never seem to suffer from the same type of negative stereotypes that black people do.  In conclusion, I think that black people should be treated with the same respect as white people, but that they should also be acknowledged for their distinct culture and history, and should not be expected to conform to the standards set by white people.

","At 82 years old, there is a possibility that death could have been due to natural causes, as it can be difficult to determine the exact cause in cases such as these. While the government may have had an interest in eliminating certain individuals at certain points in time, it is possible that they chose to wait until the individual was older in order to reduce the risk of discovery.

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

","Dear Friend,   I agree that insurance companies should not discriminate in the way you describe, as it could lead to legal action. However, there is a difference between police action and insurance decisions as the police have the power to make an arrest or intervene in a situation while insurance companies are making a financial decision based on perceived risk.  While both have the potential to cause harm, police action has a greater impact as they have the power to directly impact an individual’s life.   In conclusion, while both discrimination can have serious impacts, police action can cause more damage as it has the potential to cause physical harm as well as mental distress.

I simply don't buy it!","I disagree because, growing up in the projects, I have worked hard to create a small fortune that I have earned on my own. I have no interest in giving anyone what I have worked for. I and my brother were the only white kids in the projects, and I have been able to make something of my life there.
","I disagree because although growing up in the projects may have been challenging, everyone starts life with different opportunities and should be given an equal chance to succeed. While some people may have an initial advantage due to family wealth or connections, everyone should be able to make the most of their opportunities and create a successful life. This is fairer and more equitable. While it may be difficult at times, everyone should have the chance to succeed on their own merits.

","Tesco’s decision to install the spikes is understandable – the business needs to ensure the safety of its customers and staff.

These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house.

Is 9/11 an inside job?

Argument
The question of whether 9/11 was an inside job has generated significant debate. While many individuals are convinced that it has been conclusively proven, there remain skeptics who are resistant to such assertions. Their skepticism often stems from a deep sense of faith in the government, leading them to reject the notion that their own government could be responsible for the deaths of thousands of its citizens.

These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house.

Is 9/11 an inside job?

Argument
The question of whether 9/11 was an inside job has generated significant debate. While many individuals are convinced that it has been conclusively proven, there remain skeptics who are resistant to such assertions. Their skepticism often stems from a deep sense of faith in the government, leading them to reject the notion that their own government could be responsible for the deaths of thousands of its citizens. Over time, it is possible that more individuals will reevaluate their beliefs, especially if the country undergoes a period of martial law and curfews, potentially leading to a situation where citizens feel like prisoners in their own homes. Unfortunately, for some, the outcome may be even more dire, as there are numerous reports of concentration camps in operation, ready for use in the event of a crisis.","It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons.

","It has been proven to many people, although there is still some skepticism. This is largely due to a person's belief in their government and the ability of the government to carry out such an attack.

It also helps with anxiety and with sleeplessness. Its anti-inflammatory properties are also very helpful to those with chronic pain. In addition, marijuana is much better than the medicines the government provides for pain, nausea and vomiting associated with cancer treatments. For those who have multiple sclerosis, it helps with spasticity and allows them to walk again - better than the other medications the government provides. As for severe pain, marijuana is much more effective than morphine, which the government provides. To conclude, the healing properties of marijuana are just incredible. It's very clear that marijuana is a safer and more effective alternative to the medications the government provides for a wide range of ailments. Also, it is a MUCH better choice than the surgery the government provides - with less risk and without the side effects that often accompany surgery.

Self work and improvement can be very significant to an individual, which arguably is as important a consideration as benefitting the needs of others. Personal pursuits and pursuits for the bettering of the common good need not be mutually exclusive, as often the effects can overlap. While pursuing a personal goal, it is possible that you end up improving not just yourself, but the environment around you, in turn advancing the common good, as the outcomes help both you and others improve. At the same time, it is entirely possible that consequences of actions in your personal pursuits can clash with the desires or preferred outcomes of a collective. Similarly, it may be that an action which generally benefits a collective, very severely affects an individual and their life goals. Therefore it is important to weigh up the pros and cons of each action and how it may affect the self and others, both to judge whether it is fair to carry out the action in the first place, and also whether either abstaining from the action, or carrying out an alternative action could result in benefitting both the individual and the collective, or at the least arrive at a compromise offering a generally positive resolution to both sides.","Both personal pursuit and advancing the common good are important and necessary.

The media also portrays “a good time” for young people as having sex, meaning that it has become uncool to go without it. Additionally, girls may not be aware of the safety risks that they are taking, and may give “strange” guys too much of an upperhand if they are not careful. Parents trying to warn their daughters may also be met with a defiant reaction. As a result, date rape has become a consequnce of these factors.

As such, these impulses must be checked and controlled, to a certain extent, for a functioning and equitable society. Moreover, 100% unregulated capitalism will not work, as it has been proven to be unsustainable and detrimental to the majority. Socialism might be a better option in some cases, but controlled capitalism should be implemented as well.
","I believe that a balance between the free market and government regulation is necessary to create an effective economic system. While the free market can provide advantages, it is important to have regulation in place to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and companies cannot exploit their customers.

","I'm not the one who created this topic by the way. But people free to make their own transactions are better off this way, as the government cannot enforce an across-the-board maximum price: in theory, 100% free markets would work better.

The government can also play a role in protecting competition by setting maximum prices, for example, in the healthcare sector.  Again, in theory, competitive markets are better than those with government-imposed restrictions.

For example, in the housing sector, controlled by the state, better quality can be ensured if there are rules in place on things like land use, maximum prices, and so on.  Capitalism can work better if regulated in this way, to make sure that the maximum number of houses is available, and that prices are set correctly.

","In my opinion, fair trade and organic coffee can have a positive impact on developing countries by providing much-needed income to farmers.

I mean, take laws relating to age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds?  In other words, how do you draw a line?  With respect to age of consent laws, the motivation behind them is primarily a moral one.
","First of all, the Constitution does guarantee the right to “pursue happiness” as well as other rights, which are outlined in the Bill of Rights. While the Declaration of Independence mentions this right, the Constitution is the actual legal document that outlines the rights of citizens. In terms of criminal law, it is important to consider the severity of the crime and its potential impact on society as a whole. Laws related to prostitution often involve more than just the individuals involved and can have broader implications.   I believe that there is a role for morality in criminal law as it can be beneficial in determining what laws are put in place. For instance, laws related to age of consent may be set at different ages in order to protect minors and ensure their safety. While the laws may be different depending on the age of the participants, it is important to consider the impact of the law on both individuals and society.

Going to jail can have long-term consequences for an individual; the lack of access to healthcare is one of these consequences. While healthcare is a right, there are costs associated with it and these costs must be covered by taxes. This ensures that everyone has access to the care they need.

As they are ignored, this means they remain in their situation with no outside help, often develop serious mental health and addiction issues, and contribute to anti-social behaviour (which ranges in severity from littering and fly tipping to assault). All of these have a direct negative effect on the local community and environment, in turn leading to more public spending and lower happiness scores in the community. If homeless people were given the opportunity to get away from the streets and get the treatment they need, this would both solve the issues their presence on the streets is causing, and it would allow for them to reintegrate into society as a healthy and functioning citizen.","I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad.

Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.

Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre.

","Welfare helps to provide a safety net for people in need and is funded by the government, leading to higher taxes for those people, as well as reducing their spending power and affecting business growth. Welfare benefits can include payments for basic needs such as food and housing, with the costs of which the government must be reimbursed. This can put a strain on those receiving the benefit.  In addition, welfare benefits mean being forced to pay for some essential needs that the individual might not have been able to afford if they had to pay out of pocket for them.

In general, welfare helps to provide a better quality of life for those in need and is funded by the government, which can affect business growth.  It is worth noting that the cost of providing welfare benefits can be difficult for the individual to pay, leading to a strain on their finances.

","Welfare can reduce the incentive for individuals to move up the income ladder as it provides a safety net that reduces the risk of falling back.

These can include the right to marry someone of the same gender, or the right to marry someone from a different country.

I think that they are a product of their environment and upbringing, and that what they do does not need to be judged solely on an individual basis - if a person is comfortable being open about who they are, then that should be respected by everyone.  For example, if a gay couple is in a relationship and they want to get married, that is their right and their decision should not be judged.

I think that the community as a whole should respect their choices, regardless of whether a gay couple is in a romantic or business partnership.  Finally, I do not think that the legalisation of same-sex marriage should be limited to just marriage, but rather also to other rights such as the right to adopt a child.  When it comes to hotel accommodation, a gay couple should have the same access as a straight couple to adopt a child from the same-sex couple's home country – that is, the legal right to do so should not be limited to just marriage.
